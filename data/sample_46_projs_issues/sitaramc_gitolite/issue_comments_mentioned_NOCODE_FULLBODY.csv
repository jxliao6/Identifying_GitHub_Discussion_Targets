54,2012-10-17 15:20:46,"Hi @grimreaper,

I am the maintainer for the FreeBSD port.

It is of my opinion, that the patches included in the port (a simple find/grep/sed for perl) is not a ""fix"" that can be pushed to upstream. The patch is dependent on the local system's installation for where perl is (note I am using the make variable $PERL rather than the assumed location of /usr/local/bin/perl). This is a mundane patch that is localized to the FreeBSD architecture and can be handled consistently. Furthermore, I do additional steps beyond just patching perl paths.

I have chosen not to touch non-core files - VREFs/tests in the package - because they are non-core (also tests don't matter for the install). I have provided a patch (includes path changes AND other changes) separately for users testing the src via my github port site: http://milki.github.com/gitolite.

54,2012-10-17 15:28:50,"@milki, the patch is not system dependent. The only correct shebang line for portable scripts is to use /bin/sh or /usr/bin env.  That you need to use a ""simple"" find/grep/sed is itself a bug. This isn't specific to FreeBSD either: this is for any system that doesn't install bash in /bin.
@sitaramc's system is 'weird' in the sense of it happens to place bash in /bin unlike other systems. In addition gitolite won't work correctly if a OSX user opted to install a newer version of bash in /opt/local/bin and modified PATH to teach applications to use that instead.

Relying on bash being in /bin is as buggy on anyother non-portable system dependent construct.

In any case gitolite's maintainer already said that he has no interest in this patch, so I've dropped it.

54,2012-10-17 15:41:26,"(1) Please don't keep harping on bash -- you know the fix for that: I
will accept changing it to /bin/sh after removing bashisms.

(2) So fedora and debian are ""weird"".  That's a bit better than
""broken"", so thanks, I guess!

[top posting because the lines in the original message didn't wrap
like they usually do, for some reason, and so quoting is messed up.]
