I made these changes to enable git-annex to work correctly with gitolite and GitLab:
- fixed processing of repository urls ending with .git (GitLab recommends urls like that to users by default),
- git-annex-shell command is added to .gitolite.rc (disabled by default)
- command pattern is changed to allow for some characters git-annex may include in its arguments

These changes along with your commits in git-annex branch are also backported to gl-v320 branch of GitLab fork of gitolite - I created another pull request for those.

Best regards,
Oleg

No, unfortunately I did not have time to test it yet, I don't know if
git-annex is supported in GitLab 5.
This is one of the reasons we have not upgraded from 4.2 to 5 yet.

Let me know if you figure it out before me :)

Thank you,

lot of pending pull requests and therefore I am unresponsive.

this particular fix was done for my use of gitolite at work (since we had
to completely rebuild our git server yesterday and used the opportunity to
finally upgrade from v2), so I try to keep my work-related attributions
under my work email address and given name (hence the pull request coming
through ""infosiftr"" and not my personal account).

I really have no problem submitting this to the mailing list with a link
back here showing your brief review, if you'd like, or have absolutely no
qualms if you just wanted to grab the change to the regex and commit it
yourself (no need to accept the pull request).  I just noticed a small
deficit in one of the core scripts and figured since I wanted it fixed for
us, my first instinct was to reach out with a pull request offering the
fix.  In the future, I'll be sure to start directly with the mailing list.

I'm willing to accept patches that remove bashisms from the code and
change the shebang line to /bin/sh from /bin/bash, but that's it.

I will not use /usr/bin/env.  If you need it, your system is broken.
Fix it, or run the gitolite sources through a fixup script when you
install.

Also, /usr/bin/env also has some security issues if I recall.

And I think anything that requires env is broken.

Anyway, unless you claim this applies to 'sh' also, I did suggest
another way out (although it doesn't help with perl).

why is it more portable?  Where's the guarantee that 'env' will be
where you think it is?

as fo user's preference, the only time I see 'env' as useful is if you
have multiple versions of something and want to set the PATH before
running a script so it picks up the right one.

That argument doesn't wash here, for either bash or perl.  In both
cases, gitolite imposes no minimum version (well, perl 5.8.8, but
that's so old it's hardly a problem), so assuming you have _some_
version in the usual places, it will work.

If you don't have _any_ version in the usual places, your system is broken.

User preferences, which could even include $HOME/bin for all I know,
are for _additional_ versions, not for the base version installed in
the system.

In any case, I am not budging on this, sorry.

There _is_ a mailing list, and you should try to get a discussion
going on this.  If enough people agree, and make a good case for it
(that does not involve oddball systems, like closed-source NAS boxes,

The usual place is /usr/local/bin/bash - not /bin/bash - at least for systems I'm on

Gitolite was released August 2009.  Since that time you're only the
second person to have this problem.  (The first was some stupid NAS
box.

Not having bash at all is actually more acceptable to me (since I
support Solaris, HP-UX, etc. also); hence my comment about bashism
removal being OK.

Because the package managers fix it downstream. I was hoping that it would fixed upstream so we could stop patching it.  This isn't the biggest deal in the world, but I try to upstream fixes wherever possible (even  if minor)

54,2012-10-17 15:20:46,"Hi @grimreaper,

I am the maintainer for the FreeBSD port.

It is of my opinion, that the patches included in the port (a simple find/grep/sed for perl) is not a ""fix"" that can be pushed to upstream. The patch is dependent on the local system's installation for where perl is (note I am using the make variable $PERL rather than the assumed location of /usr/local/bin/perl). This is a mundane patch that is localized to the FreeBSD architecture and can be handled consistently. Furthermore, I do additional steps beyond just patching perl paths.

I have chosen not to touch non-core files - VREFs/tests in the package - because they are non-core (also tests don't matter for the install). I have provided a patch (includes path changes AND other changes) separately for users testing the src via my github port site: http://milki.github.com/gitolite.

And you know that I have plans to fix this. I am merely responding to

I used scare quotes for a reason - I was joking!
gitolite is broken though, for assuming that bash will be in
/bin/bash. That said - repeating this is just going to play in the
""I'm wrong because I'm immature"" comment you made earlier or something
like that.

I never said that having bash in /bin is broken.

at this point I'm not going to bother replying at all. I am well aware
of your opinions:
(a) you will accept bashism removal patches should they be submitted

I set description and owners on all projects since they will eventually be publicly available so I found this behavior quite annoying. Here is a patchset changing this.

It saves it correctly, but cannot verify it in the regex.

By cleaning out any CR character when that gets inputed, solves
the problem. Mysgit clients can continue using the default
settings. They could easily fix this issue by setting their
editors to LF instead of CR but that isn't by default.

24,2011-03-16 13:43:15,"Hello,

I believe that there is some inconsistency in the way the ""base repository path"" is handled by Gitolite (or in the way it is documented).  

https://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite/blob/pu/doc/gitolite.rc.mkd#_rarely_changed_variables says ""$REPO_BASE [...] is where all the repos go. If it's not an absolute path, it is considered to be relative to $HOME"". 

In fact, based on my experience, it is actually not relative to $HOME but to $PWD, so I would respectfully suggest a revision to the code so that it passes an absolute path to the repository to git as per the attached pull request.

You could also consider modifying the default gitolite.rc so that $REPO_BASE is defined as $HOME/repositories and/or change the documentation to clearly document the current behavior.

I hope this helps, let me know if you have any comments.
Damien

These fixes might be necessary to make some corporate ITSEC folks ""happy"".  In particular, receiving kill and term signals are now noted in the logs (but still do the same thing they did before), and a system(""echo $creator > gl-creater"") call was replaced with an echo_file() method which uses a real open (faster and safer).

Feel free to do these changes ""your way"", but I hope that their spirit can be merged into gitolite so we don't have to maintain these patches.

Thanks so much!
