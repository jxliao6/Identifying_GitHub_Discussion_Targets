Lately with everyone's day jobs it has been hard to even coordinate a weekly meeting to update everyone on the status of the project so we know how to move forward with the release. This happens with a volunteer workforce that is distributed around the planet. Hopefully we can have more info and a blog post soon.  ,cgack,arschmitz

We have to make the same CSS changes (padding) in the selectmenu CSS.
Do you remember if there was a specific reason to keep using position absolute for the count bubble, and not make it float? Now it can mask the button text, if we make it float it won't.

3. Click ""Go back""
4. Click ""Create popup""
5. Click ""Go to other page""

At this point the other page will appear below the current page, which is itself `visibility: hidden`-ed, because, upon its creation, the toolbar set all pages to be `position: relative`, so now they appear below one another.

The changes look good. I noticed one problem. When an accordion is being expanded it gets the green active style, but this style is not removed after the accordion is being collapsed. It remains green until another button gets focus. In the current situation the active style isn't really clear, but it does get removed as soon as the accordion is collapsed (http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-demos-issues/demos/). Can you give this a look?

Besides that there are a few minor style guide issues. See my comments in the diff.

2.
The testing web page was put in my server site and I linked to it through the Chrome browser under the ""Developer Tools (simulate as Apple iPhone 5)"".
Under this situation, If you move mouse (which looks like a small black circle) between two titles (ex: between Event ID 1 and Event ID 2) then the wrong issue will highly happen after you click it. 

For example,
If the black circle is much nearer to Event ID 1 than Event ID 2, it will cause the issue as following figure.

However, I do feel the project status could be communicated better. The lack of clear communication on any of the obvious channels does give the impression of a very quiet project. My guess is lot of devs are keen to know the status.

For example:
- this [changlog](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.5-Changelog) is stale (March)
- there's no info on the [1.5 milestone](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/milestones/1.5.0)
- Nothing on the [blog](http://blog.jquerymobile.com/) since 1.4 
- The [twitter channel](https://twitter.com/jquerymobile) is stale, though the [twitter hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jquerymobile&src=typd) has very little community activity.
- The forum is largely Questions unanswered by core team

It all adds up to an impression that not much is happening and uncertainty if jQM is a safe dependency to have. In particular this [forum post](http://forum.jquery.com/topic/why-are-the-jquery-mobile-meeting-minutes-not-updated-any-longer)

I _have_ just discovered the [roadmap](http://jquerymobile.com/roadmap/) so assuming it is up-to-date can I suggest a link from the wiki here on github?

I also saw a note you use IRC. Is that used and archived so we can view past discussions? Or are you active somewhere else we can join in?

I'm keen to use jQM on my [latest project](https://github.com/OpenDirective/brian), primarily as it is the **only** frontend framework/library that explicitly supports Progressive enhancement. In my case I'm not so concerned of the project has become mature and stable without lots of new feature activity. But I do want to know what changes are coming up before I embark in a lot of custom code and styling.

This test page shows the issue from #5073: http://jsbin.com/zikohihiyu/edit?html,output

I can add CSS to negate the rules from `ui-toolbar-header-button-left/right` when the class is on a span inside a custom select menu, but then the user still doesn't get the header left/right button positioning that (s)he wants. When that ticket was opened we were automatically adding the left/right button classes but we don't do that anymore, so I think it's best to document / demonstrate that in case of a select you have to wrap it in a div and add the button left/right class to that div, never on the `select` itself.

What did we decide about how we handle classes in case of generated wrappers? To add a class to the container you need to use the classes option (or enhance the selectmenu yourself once we added that option)? Adding a class to the `select` itself is not supported?

It is based on this PR.

Even though the classes `ui-mini` and `ui-toolbar-header-button-right` are getting applied to the selectmenu wrapper, `position: absolute;` from `ui-toolbar-header-button-right` is getting overridden by `position: relative;` from `ui-selectmenu` because the latter seems to have precedence.

What is the best way to resolve this?

I think we can remove `position: relative;` for `ui-selectmenu`. The `select` element has `position: absolute;` so one of the wrapper `div`s should get `position: relative;` (or anything other than the default `static`). `ui-button` already has `relative` so I think it's safe to remove it from the outer wrapper.

Have to check with a custom selectmenu as well. I can't preview this branch on view.\* since it's in your fork. Just see if anything breaks if you remove it. I can always double check after this has been merged.

> There also seems to be a problem with the arrow icon in the button. Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong?

I suppose you mean the lack of space between text and icon? Since we make the icon float with class `ui-widget-icon-floatend` we will have to add extra padding to the button. Maybe we should do that in core/button CSS, not in selectmenu CSS. Will look into that.

When we hide the page with `visibility: hidden;` but an element on that page has `visibilty: visible;`, that element will be visible.

If you look at our transitions demo (http://view.jquerymobile.com/page-hide/demos/transitions/) on a wide screen you can see the problem that this can cause. We make the menu panel visible on wide screens with `visibilty: visible;` so when you click on any of the transitions and navigate to the next page, you still see the menu panel that's on the hidden page.

So we have to make sure that all content on the page becomes invisible. The only (ugly) way to do this is:

Good point. I forgot to change the jQuery link, sorry. I just updated http://output.jsbin.com/zigimu to use jQuery Git build, but now you'll get a JS error. I think that problem is only fixed in our 1.5-dev branch where all test against jQuery Git are green. Testing this with our 1.5-dev branch has no use because in there the selectmenu widget still needs to be updated and is currently broken.

Yeah it's the same problem, good catch. I am not sure if we should apply that solution though.

The root of the problem is that our demo tries to do something (removing a checkbox when you click on it) that shouldn't want to do in a real use case. If we need to add a ugly workaround just to make our demo work I think it proofs that it's not a good demo. We need to update it anyway for 1.5 so I think it's better to look into a different UI for removing and hiding elements in the controlgroup.

what if you are removing it because you want to move it to a different group (because of the ticking, deleting and recreating).
Is it a real use case? That's how i stumbled on it.
I'm not saying it for me, as i already workarounded it (by truly moving the element) but it is better if people don't meet this problem or they will think it's the lib's fault.

@rejetto - Thanks for reporting the issue.
I only meant removing the checkbox when you click on it, so you won't get good feedback (don't see anymore which checkbox you checked) and can't uncheck it. That's a very bad UI.
Moving it from one controlgroup to another (to group unchecked and checked items separately) is fine of course. But in that case it's best to do what you did, moving the enhanced element.
I think it's better to teach that than to try to fix this in the framework (if possible) or to show an ugly workaround with `setTimeout`.

The problem with the buttons inside toolbars is that the height of mini buttons increased in 1.5-dev. Because the icons are inline-block spans the text needs to have same line-height as the height of the icon to be able to vertically align the icon and text. I think we have to reduce the top/bottom padding for mini buttons to give them the same height as in 1.4. I can create a PR for that against the 1.5-dev branch.

Thanks for the PR.

The idea was to give the last row a bit darker border bottom. Instead of removing those styles for the last row we could wrap them in a media query to make them only apply on wider screens, but I think it looks good enough without them so I am fine with removing it.

On small screens the last table row looks still a bit different than the others. This can be fixed by removing the  `.movie-list tbody tr:last-child` selector from the first rule. Can you make that change?

8002,2015-03-14 15:38:46,"@kapilgarg1996 thank you for the PR. While your fix is correct based on what we are currently doing i think we should change how this works.

Right now we are just always hiding the clear button regardless of if we are adding one leaving no way to use the native if you want.

I think we should change the current rule being modified to 



And in the clear button extension we should add the class `ui-textinput-hide-clear` to the input  when we add a clear button. 

This way if a clear button is added by jqm we hide the native clear. If no clear button is added we leave the default native if available. If you want no clear button at all native or jqm then you can simply add `.ui-textinput-hide-clear` to the input your self and make sure `clearBtn` option is `false` ( the default ) .

First of all, jQuery Mobile is a team/contributors effort. Even if this was an actual regression, it has nothing to do with who is project lead.

When you inspect your test page you'll see that the padding-top is removed from the page when you remove the first page. Probably because we had to make a change between 1.4.3 and 1.4.5 to fix an issue with page padding or fixed headers. Like @arschmitz said removing the first page is currently not supported. If you want to do it anyway you have to understand that your code might break, even in a maintenance release. We don't test it.
You might be able to work around the problem by calling `updatePagePadding()` on the active page after you removed the first page.

The clear button doesn't show up because class `ui-textinput-clear-hidden` is not removed from the clear button when the input gets focus. That class sets `display: none;`. So this is probably a JS problem in js/widgets/forms/clearButton.js.

The problem with the search icon is that it uses the wrong icon color. With theme A it should use the dark icon but instead the white one is used. This is probably a CSS issue. I will investigate.
There was already a problem with this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6757

Found that with `$content.height(0);` I have scroll jumping. So the same will be with your solution but when we have additional controls which allow to see scrolls. To fix this I need to save/restore `scrollTop`:

When links are clicked we remove the active class from all other links because we are navigating ( popup from a link is a nav event ). If you use anything else ( like an actual button checkbox open the popup from a button etc http://jsbin.com/qupasewova/1 ) this does not happen.

We should not land this PR, because it's not the right fix for the problem.

The reason we set height for the `html` and `body` element is to make `min-height: 100%;` for the page (when it's an immediate child of `body`) work, to give the page gets same height as the viewport even before the JS sets a `min-height` with pixel value as inline-style.
We shouldn't make any changes that could result in setting it for anything else than `html` and `body`.

The actual problem in @Palestinian his test page is the default browser style for `body` (margin top/bottom, padding left/right). What we could do is change it to:

http://jsbin.com/sifezo/1/

So, which one renders correctly? FF or Chrome?

Note that, in Chrome, if you set the .ui-btn padding to greather than, like, 0.9em, it starts to work the same way as FF. That's why I figured it was a Chrome bug - maybe a rounding error somewhere.
",gabrielschulhof,jaspermdegroot
7793,2015-01-08 13:01:23,"@gabrielschulhof - Using `em` values for top/bottom padding does give some unexpected results in Chrome and that is probably a rounding bug (has been reported).
I think the reason that the buttons in your test page don't have the same height is that for the first button `inline-block` is applied to an element that does have siblings, while in case of the other buttons it is applied to an element without siblings. Maybe Chrome's default browser style for `inline-block` elements is conditional or maybe there is a bug. I am not sure.
Comparing Firefox and Chrome isn't useful I think because their default style for `inline-block` can be different, without it being a bug.

7787,2014-10-20 07:24:38,"@arschmitz We can call .toString() on all string-valued option names that are supposed to be translatable. That way, if the values are strings, well, nothing happens. However, you can replace the strings with objects that provide the .toString() method. The objects themselves could then be translation-aware. This would take care of translating the string upon insertion into the DOM.

If we need re-translation while the widget is already instantiated, we can probably achieve that with the widget's refresh() method.

We can then provide the translations themselves separately, maybe as a mobileinit handler.
",gabrielschulhof,arschmitz
7787,2014-10-20 13:06:09,"We've already settled on this and as @arschmitz has said you just need to change the options. Using a translation library like gettext won't make this any easier. Either way you have to load the data.

7784,2014-10-20 20:30:31,"@arschmitz That's essentially what it's doing.  Here's the app flow:
1. Load view.  It fires an API request to get a list of stuff.
2. Once the request returns, it renders all the stuff, with a point of emphasis on it using a document fragment to only append the li's once.  It triggers the listview refresh when everything is appended.  
3. Then it programmatically sets the scroll to the bottom of the list using ""$.mobile.silentScroll()""

@gabrielschulhof - I am working on merging those two demo pages for 1.5 as part of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7753. Since it became less likely that we do a 1.4.5 I suggest we change the milestone of this ticket to 1.5 and assign it to me.

@Shreerang - Answer to your question is that input buttons are enhanced by the button widget (options corners and shadow are true by default) and anchors and button elements are not. We used a method called buttonMarkup for those but this has been deprecated. In 1.5 the difference will be gone; all buttons  will be enhanced by the new button widget.

Okay, I had some time to dig deep into this. It turns out that the Android 4.3.x stock browser has issues with the popup's semitransparent background if on that page a footer is present with `data-position=""fixed""`. If it's not fixed, then it works fine. Wherever I move the popup's div within the page, the problem persists.

7700,2014-09-25 13:20:46,"@frequent Im little tossed about this because there are differences between a list and a table. For example the way you navigate a list when using a screen reader is different then a table. Also the way the announce them is different. Also you now getting the link arrow and hover styling on the list ( which is actually a table so should not get this ). It seems to me like this is creating more problems then it is solving. 
",arschmitz,frequent
7700,2014-09-25 22:21:41,"@arschmitz Of course tables and lists are apples and oranges. I should have said, `make a table look like a listview on a small device`. Then it's technically still a table. 

If you look around there are no real good implementations out there for handling tables on mobile (JQM being one of the few providing solutions). And in fact, outside of using JQM, do you see a lot of tables on smartphone? To me lists are the predominant way of displaying a number of records on a small screen. Maybe a reason other frameworks like [ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/) or [onsenui](http://onsenui.io/guide/components.html) don't even bother to provide something-table.

From my personal experience, the columntoggle is nice while hardcoding. But once you try to squeeze something large, dynamic and existing into the table widget, things like the column-priority needing to be set are quickly making it a drag.

Actually the reflow isn't so far off from a listview ""look"" (another [example](http://jsbin.com/nahugimojafi/2/edit)). Plus you'd save having to generate the header cell for every row.

Anyway, thanks for feedback. I hadn't thought of the screenreader :-)
",frequent,arschmitz
7700,2014-09-25 22:55:39,"@frequent I do agree with you about tables on mobile. I also would say your implementation is one of the better looking examples. The issue comes when in a screen reader tables and lists are navigable via keyboard but the navigation works different so for partially sighted people it will look like a list but it will announce and navigate as a table this might be odd. 

You will notice i have left this issue open and not just closed as a feature request. I would be open to adjusting the table styling and function in reflow or looking into this more. if you could talk to @gabrielschulhof hes working on a re-write of tables right now. 

catch me on irc and we can discuss more.

The `navigate` event fires before `pagebeforechange` but after `popstate` and `hashchange`.

The only way is to stop `hashchange` is by `pushstate()` current URL and change same page `allowSamePageTransition` without transition. This works fine except for transition to previous page when panel is closed upon navigating. This requires modifying jQM's navigation history.

I'm missing something for sure.

I'm too stupid to force `grunt-contrib-requirejs` to create a single jquery-mobile JavaScript file for me (is there somewhere a simple tutorial?), and what @gseguin wrote sounds a bit like magic to me.

This means that jQM will not leave the element alone. It means that it will proceed with creation of the widget, but without injecting any new DOM elements necessary for the widget's structure.

The only way to tell jQM to leave alone an element that would otherwise be selected for enhancement is to add `data-role=""none""` to the element.

Border width (1px) and style (solid) are set in the structure CSS. Only border color is set in the theme CSS. Not only for toolbars, but in general. The reason we do this is because many widgets require borders. For example listviews and controlgroups. If the border-width would be part of the theme and you don't use the theme CSS there won't be seperator between the items anymore. We can't make an exception for toolbars because its ""bar-style"" is also used for things like list dividers. To use toolbars without borders you have to add `.ui-header, .ui-footer { border: 0; }` to your custom CSS.

7533,2014-10-06 19:17:36,"@ldeluca OK, excellent observation. If this is the case, then popups must indeed be opened via the pagecontainer ""change"" method, because that introduces sufficient ""distance"" (in terms of asynchronicity) between the click event and the opening of the popup. I implemented that for the custom selectmenu in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b0a802db5bd621b3e1c14a7d9816ae12dae21a93.
",gabrielschulhof,ldeluca
7533,2014-10-06 19:51:18,"@ldeluca if you wanna do a PR to fix this issue, you wanna look at the effect of removing

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L604

Try removing it or unwinding the stack before focusing.

The reason for the .focus() call there is to put the focus on an element (the popup's container div) that will be a valid element in the focus-restricted environment that the popup produces. It produces this environment by handling the focusin event at the document level while it's open

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L289

and transferring focus to an element inside the popup if it finds that an element that is not the child of the popup container has received focus.

To make sure your solution works correctly, you must test it on a page that includes a text input which can receive the focus by repeatedly pressing the Tab key on the page and a popup. Whenever the popup is on the screen, the text input must not be reachable via either the mouse or the keyboard.

Note that you can still trick Firefox (and maybe Chrome) into giving the text input focus by typing some text into it, then opening the popup, then searching on the page for the text you've typed. This works especially well in Firefox because of its type-to-search feature. There's no way around this (that I know of) so don't worry if that breaks the focus restriction.

7533,2014-10-06 21:43:01,"@gabrielschulhof I tried removing the call to _desiredCoords and tested but am still seeing the blue flash.  Removing the _desiredCoords call just put the popup near the button instead of at the bottom of the page.  Seems like a different issue?  

It looks like the issue is more about the style that is being applied.  The blue glow must be a :focus css style somewhere is my guess.  You sure line https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L604 is the right spot to be looking?

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L642

That is, the line that calls .focus() on the popup container element after the popup has finished opening.

I'm thinking though that the line cannot be removed because whatever element is focused before the popup opens cannot remain focused, otherwise we cannot claim that the popup restricts focus while open.

Trying different values for the popup containers focus style might not be such a bad idea though!

Here's the detail as asked in your contributing guidelines : 
The detail of a ""news"" is just supposed to be displayed, and it works correctly on almost every platform (Android for every version, Iphone 4 with IOS 6), except on the Safari browser by default on Iphone 5C with IOS 7 (7.0 & 7.1.) where I have the JQuery code output.
As told before, the version of Jquery mobile that we use is 1.3.1 (with Jquery 1.10.1), and I tryed to upgrade it to the last ont stable (1.4.2), but it didn't correct the issue. If I remove jquery mobile, there's no bug anymore.
I removed the HTML that was outside the <html> element (used for a statistics tool) on our test platform, and the issue is still there.
For example, on this page: http://m.ffgolf.org/Vivre-golf/Sante/Licencies-inscrivez-vous/ (if I reload it, the issue is gone).

Personnally, I dont see the problem because I don't have an IPhone in that version, by my client do.
He told me that he doesn't have the problem when he's using his personnal Wi-fi, and it's only in 3G (weird...).
I don't use the unminified version of jQuery mobile, becausehte minified one is faster, but if you see the issue I can change that and use the normal version if it helps.

I generated the code on your JS BIN template, here's the link : http://jsbin.com/wocutuke/1/watch.

Yes I would like to not have to refresh, because the translation plugin will run over the DOM anyway and then I need to re-query the DOM for all inputs and do a manual refresh. Also I'm wondering if I `refresh` is the only method I need on the widget, I could live without creating the widget.

If it was a `<span>` I would do pre-enhancing:



and set the same `data-i18n=""[value]...""` on the input.

If JQM handles enhancement, I set the input value as above and for the `<span>` I would probably improvise and declare on a parent with a child selector for the `span.translate` which for example is possible in i18next.

We are going to rewrite the panel widget (not sure yet in which version this will land) and will consider making this behaviour optional.

The environment [explicitly depends on the `init` module](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/39fe09ebf3d40321b7d7c389c1b5676b01093971/tests/unit/slider/index.html#L24), which [depends on the `navigation` module](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/39fe09ebf3d40321b7d7c389c1b5676b01093971/js/init.js#L16), which [depends on the `events` module](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/39fe09ebf3d40321b7d7c389c1b5676b01093971/js/navigation.js#L13), which [depends on the `events/touch` module](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/39fe09ebf3d40321b7d7c389c1b5676b01093971/js/events.js#L6).

This means that the change I'm proposing will be undetectable from that
environment. I've written a passing test, but it passes even without my change.
As it stands, regressions wouldn't be detected.

Some of the existing tests depend on the `init` module. I think those tests
should be moved to a separate document, maybe named `slider_auto_init.html`.

I want to hear your thoughts on that approach before I try that, though.
Whatever we decide on, we'll most likely have to do something similar for the

I completely replaced my page1.html and page2.html with your examples, replacing only the link. The problem is still present on my pages (though note that theres a few issues with the markup, like duplicated ID's on the second page).

I cannot trust that jsbin is operating as a normal web page would. My environment is a vanilla apache web server and there is no special fetching or iframes included. I can't quite figure out how jsbin is retrieving the second page after analyzing Chrome devtools. I see a request is made to `http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1198?0.5647212639451027`, and the MIME type is `text/event-stream`, but I'm not sure what that means here? The response is blank as analyzed in the dev tools.

I urge you to please consider my example, or to quickly setup your own. I'm sure you have a local web server on your computer where you can simply place two HTML pages. I can't seem to get jsbin to work properly. I would be more trusting if I could view the standalone page and link to the other standalone page, without using that edit view.

Thanks for sharing your work on this!

A carousel widget was indeed part of our old roadmap, from before our plan to merge with jQuery UI. We decided not to add to the new roadmap (yet) because we have to discuss a new widget like this with the UI team first.

It's a popular feature, but there are several ways you can do this and not just only one good way. That's why it might be better to show how you could do it (3rd party plugin demo) instead of adding a new widget for it.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation

""Deprecation is a status applied to a computer software feature, characteristic, or practice indicating it should be avoided, typically because it is being superseded.""

By saying the slider and rangeslider widgets are deprecated in 1.4.0, you are recommending that people avoid using these widgets as of now. Is that what you intended?

7019,2014-01-30 13:50:24,"@globalmatt the current slider has many problems and bugs which are unfixable without a full re-write. its performance is very very bad also. While we would like to fix this asap we just dont have time or man power right now to do so. We will continue to have a slider available but its api is subject to change without a prior versions notice. The new slider will be shared between both jQuery ui and jQuery Mobile and will replace the current sliders in both projects
",arschmitz,globalmatt
7019,2014-01-30 21:24:15,"@arschmitz That's great to hear. However, are you saying that people should stop using sliders and range sliders right now, in 1.4.0? Because that is what ""deprecated"" means. If so, fair enough, but I'm unclear as to what people should be using as alternatives to these widgets right now. Should they be replacing all their sliders with text inputs?

It seems to me that you should deprecate the current slider and rangeslider widgets in 1.5, once you have the better alternative widgets available.
",globalmatt,arschmitz
7019,2014-01-30 21:30:23,"@globalmatt actually the slider and rangeslider should not be marked as deprecated at all.

6991,2014-01-29 17:57:28,"@scottgonzalez Thanks, that's exactly the workaround I implemented originally (though I adjust the `at` position). There is one subtle issue, though, and that is the jQM `padding-left` is specified in `em`, while the jQuery UI position widget only works in pixels or % -- so if the base unit changes (e.g. someone forces large fonts on the page), there's a potential for things to get misaligned.

My first comment was a bit short and I shouldn't have simply closed the ticket. I don't want to give the impression that we don't care if jQuery UI works together with jQuery Mobile. We do care and that's also why we are working on sharing widgets and CSS in the 2.0 versions of both frameworks. Because we don't test the frameworks together yet, we can't always avoid conflicts or regressions like the one you reported and we might not always be able to fix an issue before 2.0, but at least I should have looked into it and tried to help you with resolving the problem. Sorry about that.

6965,2014-01-30 13:37:31,"@Eccenux the real problem here is that jquery mobile simply does not support passing information via the hash and never has. We use the has for internal navigation and so any other use will break this. Changing the has as you say you did in 1.3 is / was not supported either while it may have worked in some cases it was not supported. using navigate is basically the same. except it normalizes a few things. if you are using built in nav neither of these things are supported. As @gabrielschulhof has been pointing out there are many different workarounds for this. 

As for why you would want an id in that form i dont know but its a valid id therefor it should work. I will be doing some refactoring on navigation for 1.5 and im thinking building in support for passing data between pages will be something i look into. HOWEVER it will not be as part of the url as your trying to do it will either be restricted to an option on a call to the change method in pagecontainer or it will MAYBE be an attribute on links  have not really put much thought into it yet
",arschmitz,gabrielschulhof
6965,2014-01-30 14:08:42,"@arschmitz Note that the whole point of passing parameters within URL is to allow it to just work in browsers. If you refresh the page it should still work. This will not be a problem on e.g. PhoneGap (where you have a single entry point). But will be a problem for in-browser applications. If a user wants to refresh or share a link to document - he can do that now, but will not be able to that if you change navigation as you say. Is using hash for navigating to specific place in your app abusing hash? Maybe. But Facebook, Google and others have been using it for years. Also note that e.g. Wikimapia uses it to navigate to specific place on map (location). That's not that far from navigating to an element on a page.

You can think of it as abuse of hash. But it works and I see no other way to do that so that it will work in both browsers and hybrid applications. But if you make some document on a workaround (like @gabrielschulhof made for 1.4) and you will support it in 1.5, then I guess it's fine. I can live with that ;-). I would rather have it working out of the box, but I can incorporate it in my framework.

You said you don't have a panel on your page, but you were also talking about `data-display=""overlay""` and removing a part of the panel CSS resolves the problem. That doesn't make sense.
We really need a test page, like @gabrielschulhof asked. Just paste your markup in the JS Bin template. If you can only reproduce with a custom theme, paste all the custom CSS in the bin as well, and change the link to only load structure CSS (also make sure theme comes before structure CSS).

@ldeluca after reviewing your video, the ruling on the field stands...
The transition is indeed very slow but did you notice the flickering? Here is a timetable:
...
sec. 14: the button 'Take me back' is pressed
sec. 18: the new page is shown the first time, notice that the 'non-fixed' footer is shown a footer hight above the bottom
sec. 18 -> 20: fade to white/blank page
sec. 20: the new page is shown again, but this time the footer is correct

I think the problem is that the new page is somehow shown twice thus making the transition very slow and non-fluent. The 'first' appearance of the new page shouldn't be there...

Happy New Year :-)

Your first example: If you decide to have a header without a heading, you need to add an element with <code>class=""ui-title""</code>  to show the toolbar. http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/toolbar/ > Buttons in headers without a heading.
http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/49/edit

Second example: To add a button into a footer toolbar, you need to add the <code>ui-btn-left</code> or <code>ui-btn-right</code> classes>to it.
This because the footer has no reserved slots for buttons like headers have.
And because of the deprecated pre-positioning for buttons in toolbars in 1.4, it's also good practice to always add the above mentioned classes to toolbar buttons.

The third example is not a bug in the new theme. The `ui-btn-left` and `ui-btn-right` were never meant to be used in a footer and you will get the same result with previous versions. In the documentation we are only talking about the header when it comes to those button positioning classes.

The only way to attach events to a specific page(s) on _show_, is to place each page in a separate container and set that container as `.pagecontainer()` before calling `change`.

6842,2013-12-24 23:37:55,"@gabrielschulhof Thanks, I see that it uses a custom header which a pagecontainerload event handler uses to then load. This would be a significant change not only in my application but I'd have to change my application framework also anywhere it redirects.

I'm still unclear whether this reported bug is expected or not? I actually see the correct content (the browser seems to transparently follow the redirect) of the homepage. The only problem is that the browser history is not updated. Is this a limitation of AJAX that it doesn't tell JQM the transparently redirected to page link? Would a better solution instead be to provide some sort of header on _each_ page that is something like ""X-CurrrentLocation"" which then JQM could read? I'm trying to think of a more systemic way that JQM can solve this issue. This sort of header would be much easier for frameworks to implement because there are always hooks to add response headers, and it should be trivial because we always know which request we're processing, so we can just add that URI into the response header. What do you think?

6842,2013-12-25 04:04:24,"@gabrielschulhof I was able to successfully use your example. I catch all redirects in the framework, convert them to 200 responses and change the Location header to X-Redirect. I had some strange behavior in my framework because the sample code you pointed to might POST back on the redirect, so instead I use:



I would still like to hear your thoughts on JQM taking a different approach on this, because returning a 200 for a redirect breaks HTTP semantics. It seems to me the only problem is JQM doesn't know the indirect redirects that the browser does for the AJAX call - so how about the X-CurrentLocation idea so that all pages return ""who they are,"" and therefore JQM can tell where the browser indirectly redirected to (at least for the final page, which I think is all that matters)?

The `ui-btn-right` class is only meant for buttons inside a header toolbar. Because that class sets `position: absolute;` the bar won't get the height of the button. Currently the only way of doing this is with custom CSS.

Instead of using an anchor element and then prevent it from being an anchor you better don't use an anchor at all.

The best way to do this is by not using `data-role=""listview""` but adding classes yourself and set styles that aren't set by the framework anymore (because it expects certain markup) in your custom CSS.

All browsers add a scrollbar to that page, even though there's nothing to scroll...quite similar to that GoogleMaps-example above.

'phun007' elaborated about this a year ago here: 
http://forum.jquery.com/topic/pages-with-header-and-or-footers-and-the-min-height-page-calculation

Basically the page's 'min-height' is set too high, the toolbar-height (or page-padding for it) needs to be subtracted from that value.

Technically this won't be possible for the reveal and push panel as long as we need a wrapper for the page contents. But even if it would be possible I am not in favor of supporting this. The idea of a panel is to temporary display content without the need to leave a page. So users expect to be on the same page as long as the panel is open. Anything else seems very confusing to me.

This issue is because on ""tap toggle"" fixed toolbars get `position: absolute;`. The footer is outside the page so it's positioned absolute to the body. And because pages have `position: absolute;` as well the body doesn't have the same height as the page.

The only way we can fix this is by using `position: relative;` for pages. That's not a simple change (transitions, etc.) that we can do now, but we will look into that for a future version. As a quickfix I will hide fixed external footers completely instead of just switching to absolute position.

The reason that your example doesn't work is not because `data-role=""fieldcontain""` has been deprecated. It is because `$( ""selector"" ).enhanceWithin();` initializes everything inside the selected element. So the selected element itself won't be enhanced. See http://jsbin.com/AKOmUxa/11/edit

Closing as not a bug.

PS. Thanks for the PR! Although `data-role=""fieldcontain""` still works in 1.4 we should indeed update the demos to teach people to use class `ui-field-contain` instead.

6492,2013-09-24 14:44:58,"@PangbornIdentity Thank you for the contribution. I think this could be a good idea however your PR would not work with data-attribute name spacing to make sure your code works with namespacing you should use `$.mobile.getAttribute( element, property )`, this also forces data-id to be persistent for this to work which i don't think makes sense this should either be something like `data-persist=""true""` or check if something else with the same data-id exists and allow it to be anything. 

In addition i think the property to make the wrapper persistent should be something that is set on the widget element not the wrapper element since this is created at run time so you would want to check if the property exists on `this.element` rather then `this._wrapper`

This is really bad news for me. My whole app has fixed toolbars and has been in development for over a year, and we're about to ship v1.3. This bug that I filed here is currently my only showstopper.

What are fixed toolbars for if they don't work on Android? I don't understand. Is this explained somewhere?

My app's main page has a movable map in a div right below the menus that responds to touch events. I played around with it, removing the fixed toolbar on that page and rearranging some HTML/CSS, and usually now I can move the map without moving the toolbar, but once in a while, you can end up moving the menus up and out of sight, leaving the app without a menu system in view! (And it's hard to get the menu buttons back, as they're just as unlikely to scroll into view as they were to scroll out of view. I have to catch it just at the right moment, using a trick: moving the map far enough it has to refresh to a new tile, and then flick down quickly over and over so some of the touch events after the map refresh finishes end up moving the whole page down and menus back into view.) And I as a developer know the menu buttons are there, but a user will have no clue. (And it's unacceptable they disappear at all, of course.)

I can't ship like this. Is there any way you all can fix this problem with the fixed toolbar?

And if not, is there anything I can do to keep my menus from floating away when map-drags in my map div become interpreted as whole-screen-drags that drag the menus away?

I'd appreciate any ideas.

Thanks,

Jack

6485,2013-09-27 17:51:19,"@arschmitz thanks. 

I tried the SwipeFix, with no success.

I see in the instructions that I should include it after the jQuery Mobile script and before I do any event bindings. I include the < script src=""jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.js"" >< /script > last, after all my personal source JS code, as this needs to be included after $(document).bind(""mobileinit""), which I do in my own source code.

So where would SwipeFix.js go in this order?:

< link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.css"" / >
< script src=""jquery-1.9.1.min.js"" >< /script >
// If I put SwipeFix.js here, it's before the jQuery Mobile script (BAD) and before event bindings (GOOD)
< script type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8"" src=""cordova.js"" >< /script >
< script type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8"" src=""MySourceCodeThatDoesEventBindings.js"" > </script >
< !-- This script MUST be after $(document).bind(""mobileinit"", function(), so keep it last here. -- >
< script src=""jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.js"" >< /script >
// If I put SwipeFix.js here, it's after the jQuery Mobile script (GOOD) but after event bindings (BAD)

I tried both places, with the same result.

Adding an link button to the collapsible heading means having an anchor inside an anchor which means the generated markup is invalid. Even when other elements are used and the markup isn't invalid, a clickable area inside another clickable area should be avoided because you will run into issues on touch devices.

You can already use '''data-collapsed-icon=""false""''' to have no icon. Have to check if this is documented.

Both options are not available for listview. See the API docs http://api.jquerymobile.com/listview/.

We looked into supporting mini before, but decided not to add it. Because of changes we made for 1.4 you can probably make a basic listview mini by adding class `ui-mini` to the `ul`. Note that this is not a supported feature so you have to resolve CSS issues, if any, by yourself.

6352,2013-08-18 11:45:12,"Thanks @frequent.

I think the collapsible set widget is not the the right base for tabs, because there are more differences between the two UI components than just horizontal versus vertical. One thing is that with tabs I would expect that there is always one tab visible/open. I also think that they are meant for different purposes and length of content. Accordions should only contain short pieces of content for example. So it's questionable if falling back from tabs to accordions on small screens should be desired.

Besides this it looks like it's impossible to get the width of the content right with the collapsible set markup because of rounding issues when using percentages. The lack of support for IE8 would also be a problem and we can't use data- attributes in our CSS because we support namespacing.

Saving a widget by adding a new feature via an option in an existing widget is actually not a benefit. In a custom download I would get all collapsible tabs CSS while I might not even use it. Maybe it's a small change when adding it, but sooner or later options require additional JS or CSS to deal with exceptions when we want to change something or have to fix an issue. We actually want to reduce options.

So we are going to stick with UI tabs, also because this fits in the project goal of making all widgets work in both frameworks. We didn't add CSS for UI tabs to keep it as flexible as possible. You can add a body theme class to the content to style it. I am going to close this PR, but wanted to give some feedback which could also be useful when you work on other new features

Are you talking about the grid function that adds gird classes? That is a function for internal use (navbar widget) and not a documented feature. We might even remove it when we refactor the navbar widget for 1.5. Closing because we won't implement, but let me know if I misunderstood.

I looked into it again and we can't transition `ui-content`. The reason is that we set a background to the element we transition and make it inherit the height from the page. That means that a footer (not fixed) will be pushed down.

We change the `type` attribute from ""search"" to ""text"" during enhancement to prevent native clear buttons and add the framework clear button. This way you have a consistent result on all browsers.

If we make it optional, we probably have to add an option whether to hide the native clear button yes or no. Another thing is the default value for the option `clearBtn` which is `false` while we would want this to be `true` for search inputs.

This test page shows you can already have all desired results if you write the markup yourself: http://jsbin.com/edeluh/58/edit.

I don't agree. All size and position related CSS is in the structure CSS files. There shouldn't be any widget specific rules in the theme CSS. If you have custom build and don't use popup (arrow) you don't want rules for that in your CSS.

I think it would be cool to add a page to the demo center where you can change popup arrow CSS with range inputs and directly see the result. Then you can change the values in your own build or add overrides.

Default:
- inline SVG + external PNG: jquery.mobile.icons.css + jquery.mobile.theme.css + jquery.mobile.structure.css = jquery.mobile.css

Additional files to be used with loader script:
- inline SVG: jquery.mobile.icons.data.svg.css + jquery.mobile.theme.css + jquery.mobile.structure.css = jquery.mobile.data.svg.css
- data-uri PNG: jquery.mobile.icons.data.png.css + jquery.mobile.theme.css + jquery.mobile.structure.css = jquery.mobile.data.png.css
- external PNG: jquery.mobile.icons.fallback.css + jquery.mobile.theme.css + jquery.mobile.structure.css = jquery.mobile.fallback.css

These are the current filenames. I suggest to rename the icon source and the destination files:
- data.svg.css --> svg.css
- data.png.css --> data-png.css
- fallback.css --> png.css

A destination file name like ""jquery.mobile.svg.css"" might be a bit confusing though. Like it only contains the icon CSS. Suggestions?

The default CSS is already working fine, because we only added an @import rule. The additional files work the same, the destination files with @import rules are on the repo. We have to build those CSS files (unminified and minified) and add them to the ZIP and CDN.

I think we also have to include the icon source files (unminified and minified) in the ZIP and upload the to the CDN. That means another 8 files :/

When we update the ThemeRoller we have to look into exporting custom theme and icon CSS in one file (4 versions). In my first comment I suggested to combine icon and structure CSS but that was not a good idea.

`buttonMarkup` is a function and not a widget so there is no `_setOptions()`. That's why your code doesn't work. 

For anchors with `data-role=""button""` and button elements you can use this code to change the option:



Inputs with `type=""button|submit|reset""` use the button widget so you can use this:



When we only need to add or remove classes to/from the native element, just using a function is much better for performance than using a widget. So we only use the widget if we need to do more during enhancement, like wrapping the native element in `div`. That's the case with `input` because otherwise we can't add icons.

Note that for `button` things changed. Before 1.4 we were wrapping them so they used the widget. As from 1.4 we don't do this anymore so we just use `buttonMarkup()`.

We are aware of the fact tha we have a documentation issue regarding buttons: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/85

The `ui-btn-left` and `ui-btn-right` classed are used to position buttons in the header. If you want to do something similar in the footer you have to use custom CSS. The easiest way is probably adding rule `.ui-footer .ui-btn-right { top: auto; bottom: .375em; }`.

Supporting this would also mean we have to make sure those buttons are not on top of footer text or a navbar, if present. We can't do that properly in the framework with just CSS.

We were adding a ""hidden"" class, but only for button/submit inputs. I removed that in branch ""next"" because we can just use something like `.ui-input-btn > input`. Only thing we have to think about is that when we add an option to handle all markup yourself; this would also hide the native input on a C-grade browser.
Hiding the native input/select element has to be done differently for almost all form widgets so I don't think we should use a generic class here.

6042,2013-06-06 09:16:31,"@arschmitz thanks for looking into this an even providing a working example!!

Unfortunately, I cannot use the approach you are proposing since my use case is slightly different from @akc42's. I didn't stress this more in the beginning since I am seeing exactly the same behavior like @akc42 : ""chrome seems to wait until the stack has unwound before raising a popstate event whereas firefox(actually I am using Debian iceweasel) doesn't.""

In my case the initial page has loaded completed and fired pageshow. After (!) pageshow I want to auto-open a dialog _on top of_  the initial page (I added some transparency to the background around the dialog so that the initial page is still visible in the back) so that the user can enter some missing data. When the user has completed this dialog, he should arrive back at the initial page.

http://jsfiddle.net/ZmcP8/15/ shows exactly what I am trying to do (no more onload). The dialog keeps on auto-closing in my Chome 26.0.1410.65.

Since I want the user to go back to the initial page, when closing the dialog, I do not see how I could apply your pagebeforechange approach in my case.

Happy for any hint you could provide, thanks!
",lisaantagonist,arschmitz
6042,2013-06-06 10:54:21,"@arschmitz I can see what you are doing - and it might work in my case.

However its not very elegant.  the page with id = ""Calls"" is the default page for the application and all I am doing is if the user is not logged on putting up the dialog box to enable him to logon.  Once he has, and providing the cookie doesn't expire (currently when he closes the browser, but I don't want to limit it to that) all subsequent calls to the default page will not display the dialog and should just display as normal.  Indeed my code actually removes the whole logon dialog from the DOM.

I could change your example to test the cookie in the pagebeforeload event so it is a potential solution, but ...

I think you miss the point, or maybe I just don't understand the code well enough.  This isn't about why I am trying to open the dialog when I am, what I am saying is that I think the logic for handling a potential popstate event just after the write to windows.location.hash on line 2482 of jquery-mobile 1.3.1 seems to be wrong. The example I provided illustrates the problem, I made the problem go away with the patch I suggested (and that is why I think the logic is wrong) but when I did that much of the other sections of the logic didn't seem to make sense, and trials with lots of console.log statements  showed much of the logic wasn't being used (in either Firefox or Chrome). It needs someone who understands what that section of code is trying to do to confirm whether or not I have understood it properly. 

Closing the report is a sticking plaster, not a solution.

The way I read it (and I verified by testing), when you set the option to true (default), the option will be bypassed and the taphold will not emit a tap (which is fine by me but would be a breaking change as you explained):



If you set the option to false, then tap will never be triggered which would be a bigger issue. Here is some code to set the option as you want (I'd prefer not making it optional personally as it makes the code heavier and complicated even though I understand your argument):



I am preparing a new pull request to fix this issue and fix an edge case when the taphold event is bound to a link, a mouseup event will still be triggered by propagation and will lead to the link being opened after the taphold is triggered. This can be avoided by using  `event.stopPropagation()`.

I arrived at my latest suggestion after implementing an interface with multiple ways of filtering a list (or multiple controls where, when any control changes, the same list must update).

So, for example, the list has the standard search input filtering by name _and an additional_ radio group filtering on another significant attribute.  This type of requirement will be more probable in cases where each list item has a very rich data-set and the result-set is fairly large - users will be more inclined to narrow results based on numerous attributes.

My suggestion arose as it is difficult to support multiple controls filtering the list given the current filter / search implementation.  It has two limitations:
1. There is no method exposed to trigger filtering of the overall list.  This logic appears to be embedded in the _onKeyUp function in listview.filter.js.
2. The _onKeyUp method is designed to solely support the search filter control as it will **show or hide
   the entire list** when the search input is empty.

Consequently, my suggestion was to:
1.  Expose a filter method that could be used as an event callback by any additional control filtering the list.  For example, filtering could then be triggered on change of a radio group value.
2.  Remove the logic that shows or hides the entire list when the search input is empty and leave it to the filterCallback to decide what is shown.

This suggestion is predicated on the logic that considers all the filters being in the filterCallback method.

To make my suggestion more concrete, here's something I threw together in an attempt to patch the existing behaviour (in CoffeeScript):



As the _onKeyUp method interfere's with the approach I have suggested, I unbind the callback before binding the new solution.

The patch can be used like so (again CoffeeScript):

In general: when you add `data-role=""[widgetname]""` to an element the framework will enhance it during initialization. If you then call the plugin and set options (read: change options) you have to call the `refresh` method of the widget as well.

The panel in that fiddle has `data-role=""panel""` on it. If you leave that out you should be able to set the display option when you call `panel()`. If you want to change the option on-the-fly you have to call the `refresh` method, BUT... the panel widget doesn't have this method yet :(

Also, I don't believe you need to implement `_setOption` if you've implemented `_setOptions` because the widget factory always calls `_setOption` from `_setOptions` and it processes `.widgetname( ""option"", ""optionName"", newValue )` via `_setOptions`. So, even if a single option is changed, it still calls `_setOptions()` with a hash containing a single key.

I have several topic related to performance too. Will try describe in few words:

On our side we work with large data and most critical topic is generating `collapsibleset` and `listview`.
Optimization that we use here (for example, in `collapsibleset`):
- Clone `collapsible` widget (without re-creating and refreshing) and change only necessary data (all this done with [knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com/) bindings),
- Implement `collapsible` events handling in `collapsibleset` (delegated handling).

With this we have good performance and only one problem exists - always big deal to update jQueryMobile to latest version.

May be you have ideas how implement delegated handling for `collapsibleset` and `listview` in jQueryMobile.

If this topic interesting I may spend time to prepare real example for this.

First, thanks for the PR! 

It sounds like you're proposing we avoid executing the `enhance` method depending on what widgets are in the page. If you look at the enhance method below, you'll see that nothing really happens if no elements match the initSelector. That is, if there are no elements in the page that the widget handles it won't really do anything.

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.widget.js#L46



You could make the case that we can eliminate some function calls but the performance win would be pretty minimal relative to the expensive dom manipulations that take place.

It's also possible I've completely misunderstood what you're proposing! In that case, where performance is concerned it would be good to have a jsperf sample to show the performance improvement / expectation / environment. (http://jsperf.com)

Thanks!

I talked with @gabrielschulhof and he explained the idea to me in IRC. He's going to get together some perf numbers on the parsing/interpretation savings and then we'll make a decision on the tradeoff in terms of complexity.

Thanks for your help!
",johnbender,Changsuk
5784,2013-03-20 04:26:31,"@johnbender, First, thanks for your kind comment. :)

My proposal executes the same enhance method as jQM does.
Even if there are no elements in the Web page, all of $.widget() methods in widget's IIFEs are parsed and compiled by JS engine and all of widgets' binders call enhance().

JS engines pratically take time to parse and compile JS function more than we know.
So my team wanted to reduce the parsing and compilation time and enhance() method call count.
If we change $.widget() method call to a variable, JS engine doesn't parse and compile it. So, eventually, we can reduce Web App's launching time. 

I really hope my comment can help you understand my team's proposal. And if you have any questions or another view, please tell me here or on IRC. Thanks.

However, we're talking about a popup dialog here.  Since the browser doesn't know it is a popup dialog (it just appears to be part of the page from it's perspective), it's default behaviour is probably not what users are expecting in the context of a popup. 

It would be good if jQuery Mobile could provide some work-arounds so the popup dialogs are still useable in this situation. It's really bad user experience to have the dialog move out of view in this way after closing the keyboard.

Currently it looks like this http://jsbin.com/owasir/3 which isn't too bad if you ask me. I agree it can be optimized, but we always have to consider if it's worth the extra code and what it does to performance.
Checking if the textarea is disabled on each keyup might not be a good idea, but adding logic to the `disable` and `enable` methods to remove/add the extra line is probably acceptable.

Thanks for the PR. Here is my feedback.
- `-moz-border-radius`: We just removed this from the CSS because we support Firefox 4+ which supports the unprefixed property.
- `-moz-appearance`: I think we added `-webkit-appearance: none;` to those two rules for hiding the native element to resolve an issue on an older WebKit browser. Hiding the element works fine on Firefox and Firefox for Android so there is no need to add this.
- `-o-` prefixed transitions: The framework only enables transitions if a platform/browser supports 3D transforms. That is to be sure that all transitions will work (not just the 2D) and that they will animate smooth. Opera doesn't support 3D transforms so we didn't add this. See #4521.
- `-ms-` prefixed transitions: IE supports transitions from IE10 and doesn't require the prefix (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673535(v=vs.85).aspx). We added the unprefixed properties in 1.3 to support transitions on IE10. `-ms-` is superfluous.

`transform: translate3d(0,0,0);` isn't needed there. This rule is there to force mobile WebKit browsers to use hardware acceleration. This trick isn't needed for Firefox or IE so we only use the `-webkit` prefixed property.

I have finally had some time to work on the filter widget. I took the version in the ""next"" branch and made a few admendments.

Demo here: [filter widget](http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/filter/demo.html)

Comments:
- I did not change much except for the `children()` selector
- I have replaced the wrapping `<form>` because I'm often stuck wanting to use a filter inside a larger form and the form is never submitted anyway. So now it's a plain textinput wrapped in a `<div>`
- the filter can be used on `listview`, `select`, `table`, `controlgroup` or any element containing children to filter using the `data-itemSelector` attribute (must be a class)
- this also allows to use one filter for multiple datasets and filter anything containing text or filtertext
- I also added `data-target` (must be a class) to place the filter somewhere on the page vs the default behavior

Some Questions:
1. I also adapted the Qunit tests from the [listview](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/next/tests/integration/listview/listview_core.js) widget. Should I add tests for select, table, controlgroup, random as well? 
2. I'm having trouble with one test [""`Custom filterCallback should cause iteration on all list elements`""](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/next/tests/integration/listview/listview_core.js#L657), where my `_refreshCornersCount` is stuck at 2, so the test never fires although it would pass. Who can I ask for help?

I have pasted a JSBin url in my previous post. Here's what you can do to repro the issue after which you probably will have a clear understanding of the problem.

1) Fire the URL in iPad with Mobile Safari environment.

2) Open the Custom SelectMenu.

3) Click on any of the option in Custom SelectMenu. If you have fiddler attached to the session, you would not notice any HTTP request from the browser.

4) Now, please try the above steps by replacing iPad with Windows Surface and Use IE10 as browser. In this case, you would _notice_ a HTTP request from the browser which hits the same URL as mentioned in the browser address bar. 

I do not think there should be any extra HTTP request on touch of any link in IE10 with Surface environment which is what happening right now.

About the second issue. I had a look at that readme, but it's still not clear to me. JQM's logic to add a header/footer is looking for a div with `data-role=""[header|footer]""`. So I don't understand how a CSS class can interfere with this.

Re: ""Any possibility of integrating those changes directly into JQM?"" - The solution for the first issue is setting the default for certain options to false. The fact that those features are optional and you can configure the default is the solution, so basically this is already integrated.

Also once the jQuery pointer events polyfill https://github.com/jquery/jquery-pointer-events is ready we will be switching to using that in place of our vmouse abstraction. This will allow us to implement this in a consistent cross platform way. There is a test implementation of this in the polymer branch https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/polymer this currently however does not support ie8 or 9 as this uses the polymer pointer events polyfill directly rather then the jQuery version.

5534,2015-05-30 20:20:23,"Still seeing this problem with an up-to-date S5 (AT&T) running Android native browser and Android 4.4.2. Not surprisingly angular ng-swipe-left and ng-swipe-right are also effected. 

I did notice a discrepancy in the user-agent strings between Chrome and Native Browser on this device:
**Chrome:** ...(HTML, Like Gecko) **Chrome/43.0.2357.78**...
**Native Browser:** ...(HTML, Like Gecko) **Version 1.6 Chrome/28.0.1500.94**...

So apparently an up-to-date S5 is running Chrome 28 as the rendering engine in it's default browser? Note that [remote debugging in the native browser seems to have died when Android switched from Apple's rendering engine to Chrome](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/75336/why-is-the-android-stock-browser-still-alive).

Unfortunately S5 is the most popular Android out there and most people still use the big Internet button by default. So even though this is Google/Samsung's problem, it's our problem. 

Can anyone give me a straightforward monkey patch to get some kind of swipe to work on the old Chrome rendering engine? 

Edit: I see the ez-shim above by @TNT-RoX . I am going to try that.*

Edit edit: no dice. I can only get the ""swipeLeft"" and ""swipeRight"" events to fire (using test.html) on desktop chrome - but not on either the Native Browser or Chrome on the device referenced above. Seems like el.onscroll doesn't fire at all on those browsers on the test app.

I confirm this solution works for forms on both long scrolling and non-scrolling pages.
@IHNEL I think you meant on blur, not on focus. I quickly tested the fix on focus and did not work.

I have validation on the page (jquery.validation), and even with the above fix, when one clicks the submit button on empty fields, the first field of the form get focused. This causes the header, although positioned correctly, to appear and lay over the focused field. I therefore came up with my own twist, not sure if it helps anyone or it'll be still applicable for jQM 1.3.1.

Before jQM is loaded:



Then, in my template's js, i call this on pageshow (only for ios):



The above ""unfixes"" the header/footer while an input field is focused. I don't really like for the header/footer to disappear in case the user scrolls when the keyboard is up. It looks particularly odd on short non-scrolling pages like a login screen.

I've tried under both IE7 emulation in IE9 (eg 'IE7 mode') along with IE7 vanilla.

5512,2013-02-18 12:52:58,"@erikyuzwa AFAICT IE7 is also broken on 1.2.0: http://jsbin.com/esazem/1 ... as you go through the sequence

page1(start) -> page2 -> page3 -> page1 -> page2

and then hit ""Back"" repeatedly, you find that you have to click the ""Back"" button many times before it will retreat to the previous page:

The first step (page1 <- page2) back is immediate - that's correct.
The second step (page3 <- page1) takes two clicks of the ""Back"" button.
The third step (page2 <- page3) also takes two clicks of the ""Back"" button.
The fourth step (page1 <- page2) takes three clicks of the ""Back"" button.

At this point, although you're seeing the start page, there's still a history entry to go before you get to the beginning. So, there's no reliable way of operating the ""Back"" button. That's why we've chosen to document instead that, if you wish to support IE7, you're better of with single-page, AJAX-linked documents instead of a single, multipage document.

In addition to @gabrielschulhof his comment...

In previous versions the JS applied those corner classes. For performance we changed this to having the JS only apply the `ui-corner-all` or `ui-btn-corner-all` class. In the CSS we added rules to make child elements inherit the `border-radius` for the applicable corners.

If you used those classes for other elements you have to add them to your custom CSS. Note that you don't need the `-moz` prefixed property anymore. Two examples with the default radius of .6em:

I see the issue. It appears to be a timing problem. On iOS6 on `pagebeforeshow` the padding-top of the second page is 2px. We set a default padding for `.ui-page-header-fixed`, but it looks like on `pagebeforeshow` this class has not been added yet. Calling `updatePagePadding` before starting the transition won't help because, again on `pagebeforeshow`, the height of the header is 0px.

Should the false result of an getAttribute method result in an undefined?
  -> Yes,  If jqmData() can't find matched attribute or a data in an array, jqmData() returns undefined. The committed codes with undefined can meet the jqmData()'s return value.

What is jqmData doing in those cases when the attribute is not found?
  ->  As you may know, jqmData() calls jQuery.fn.extend.data() hence, if jQuery.fn.extend.data() doesn't find the attribute, it returns undefined. You can understand it with the jQuery codes and my comments below.

return data === undefined && parts[1] ?      // If jQuery.data() doesn't find the attribute, the data is undefined.
this.data( parts[0] ) :
data;                                                        // It returns undefined.

I'm guessing I introduced this bug when I re-implemented `$.mobile.hashListeningEnabled`. Part of the problem is that it's not clear what that setting accomplished before the refactor. 

That is, we didn't have any tests for it :(

@gabrielschulhof 

When `$.mobile.hashListeningEnabled` is `false` how are dialogs supposed to work? Recall that previously our entire navigation infrastructure was based on hash events so for the most part this means that navigation is ""OFF"". At the very least that was the assumption I made when re-implementing it. 

More importantly when I made the addition I did my testing with the assumption that `$.mobile.linkBindingEnabled` was also `false` (stupid). So it might be that we only need to figure out what it means to have link binding enabled but to have hash listening disabled.

I don't know very much about the internal working of jQuery Mobile, but in my experience it turned out to be possible to disable changes of the URL/hash by just commenting out the line `window.location.hash = hash;` in `$.mobile.Navigator.prototype.go()` (see code example from four days ago).

",jhogervorst,johnbender
5465,2013-01-21 18:20:33,"@jhogervorst 

It depends. Calling `$.mobile.navigate` comes with some expectations, including history entry creation that matches the browsers history. Breaking that assumption might hurt other parts of the library.

Also we want to keep those settings confined to the old nav code where we can. They're already bleeding into the navigate event. The goal is to have these stand on their own as functionality for users who don't want to use the whole of JQM.

These two settings in concert pretty much turn off browser history handling. [Dialog](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/a9a6b234c45f0e100d613fed3e55eecb58f8ed60/js/widgets/dialog.js#L123) and [popup](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/a9a6b234c45f0e100d613fed3e55eecb58f8ed60/js/widgets/popup.js#L190) both have provisions for dealing with the situation where modifications of the hash are undesirable. Navigation is then based solely on $.mobile.urlHistory and $.mobile.changePage, which itself had code for avoiding the call to $.mobile.path.set(), which would then set the hash. However, with $.mobile.navigate() the setting of the hash has been tied to the creation of urlHistory entries, which makes the above logic impossible.

There once was a fetchlink functionality planned for JQM 1.past ([here's a demo](http://view.jquerymobile.com/fetchlink/docs/pages/fetchlinks/pix-4.html)). I'm doing a lot of content-pulling and was thinking whether this should not be combined into the container widget. 

Something like:
- a page can have any number of `<div data-role=""container""></div>` widgets. 
- like the `<body>` tag, all containers are viewports.
- when doing a changePage, user can specify changePage option `container=""container_id""` to override default `<body>` (normal changePage). 
- calling `navigate` vs changePage does sound better.
- the loaded content will be appended to the container (... `ui-container-page`?)
- changeHash option specifies whether this transition is tracked in `urlHistory`  

JQM navigation more or less does this on a page level already (pulling a page, extracting content, appending, tracking in history), so containers would just be sort of a sub-navigation. This should allow pages to persist with only content changing, keep trackable history, plus transitions should work nicely, too.

I will try to see if I can hack an example together.

Thoughts?

A lot of what you outlined is what I have in mind for the content container.
- This is the first pass at breaking up navigation but the ultimate purpose for having a content container is to allow multiple content containers on the same page for tablet UI applications
- The default state is for jquery mobile applications to have a single container that defaults to the body. This is important because it informs how we'll replace `changePage` and `loadPage` as global methods.
- This is where we differ, when this is finished the global `changePage` and `loadPage` will be deprecated, and will look something like:


-  This is the ideal. Calling `$.mobile.navigate( 'some_url', opts)` and letting the navigate binding of the content container widget ""work it out"". When we get to the point that the UI requires multiple containers we'll need to think through providing hooks for managing the individual urls and loading specific content based on them. We've had some very basic discussion around this but it's not clear how we can encode enough information in a url to designate the right content for multiple containers. One approach is to have a single ""primary container"" that retrieves the content at a url and uses that content to delegate content to other containers on the page. This is the point at which hooks would be provided to allow the client to determine how that content is delegated.

I've talked with @gabrielschulhof about this but we can pretty easily setup `$.mobile.navigate` to pass arguments through when it triggers the navigate event so we can remove the `$.mobile.changePage` calls from our link bindings and make them an optional module.

Obviously that has implications for the ""fetch links"" in that they would just be links with a simple binding to trigger a navigate with some special options possibly.

Thanks for the PR!

To be honest I don't see the need of adding an option ""disable"" for collapsible. It adds quite some code to the framework while this is currently already possible by simply adding class `ui-disabled` to your collapsible heading. That also prevents the collapsible to expand on click. Example: http://jsbin.com/osiwuw/18

Thanks for the PR! I reviewed your code and created a [test page](http://jquerymobile.com/branches/text-input-clear-btn/docs/demos/textinput/index.html). Here is my feedback:
- `clearBtn: false` should be added to `options` so you can configure the default or set the option programmatically, not only with the data- attribute.
- With your code the clear button is added if you don't set the data- attribute at all. After making `clearBtn` an option you can use `if ( input.is( ""[type='text']"" ) && !!o.clearBtn ) { }`. The widget factory will check if `data-clear-btn` has been set.
- I think we should introduce option `clearButtonText` and deprecate `clearSearchButtonText`.
- Except for the variable `focusedEl` the code for adding the clear button is exactly the same as for ""search"" so we shouldn't have to duplicate everything.
- Text inputs and textarea should get the `ui-corner-all` class instead of `ui-btn-corner-all`.
- The disabled styling doesn't work anymore.
- The width is incorrect when wrapped in a div with `data-role=""fieldcontain""`.
- There are some conflicts with native browser controls for input types number, date, etc. (I tested on Chrome). I am not sure yet what we should do with those.
- The slider widget has a number input that is enhanced by the textinput widget. In this case `clearBtn` should always be ``false`.

Had to make a small change because of an undeclared variable. Also, at second thought `clearBtnText` is a more consistent name for the option, so I changed that. See my commits here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/text-input-clear-btn

I made a few changes. We think the clear button shouldn't be optional for ""search"". I enabled the option for all input types. We still have to look into date, number, color and other HTML5 input types, but those can be added to the blacklist.

When I wrote that I was thinking about using the same one or two breakpoints for all widgets and you mentioned 30em (480px) for tables as one of them. As discussed we are not going to use generic breakpoints, so make sense to use 28em here.

I agree that making changes to this feature, just for the sake of consistency is not a good idea. That was not the main reason for suggesting an opt-in class for fieldcontain as well. It's more like, if we introduce this for other widgets it's a good opportunity to do the same here, because it's not easy to negate the fieldcontain CSS if you want to use a different breakpoint.

However, I see your point that adding `data-role=""fieldcontain""` is pretty much the same as adding an opt-in class. Difference is that I added a function to the fieldcontain JS that prevents wrapping of full width forms, so it's not only CSS.

Let's see if we can come up with a solution that doesn't break things when used with current markup.

Test case: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/listviews/listview-filter-autocomplete.html

Steps to reproduce: Enter first 3 characters of a city name. Click on the clear button or view source button.
Because the ""change"" event is fired after you blur the input, the first click on one of those buttons triggers that event. Only after you click a second time the input field will be cleared or source view popup will be opened.
However, if we wouldn't bind to ""change"" the list wouldn't be updated when you click on the clear button.

[Now](a743616) we also bind to the ""input"" event to fix problems with multibyte characters (e.g. Japanese), the problem became a bit worse.  When you enter a character both ""keyup"" and ""input"" fire and in the test case this means two Ajax calls. I don't think the ""input"" event is supported by all browsers that we support, so we can't just drop ""keyup"".

Regarding pasting text which @arschmitz mentioned: Maybe we can resolve this by binding to ""paste"" and ""cut"" events, but again browser support might be a problem. And we would still need ""change"" to update the list when the clear button is clicked, unless we make this trigger a ""clear"" event or something.

5167,2015-09-24 22:37:16,"@arschmitz the usage of `*-beginning / end` is awesome, and actually working on a proper RTL implementation is awesome, too.  The other part of class naming for icons is for when the icon itself has an indication of directionality, but is has `*-l / r` in the name. For example, the icon arrow-r is often used to indicate a forward facing arrow (as far as LTR is concerned) for more options in a listview.  Aliasing these icons to arrow-next, arrow-previous, carat-next, carat-previous, etc, to arrow-l, arrow-r, carat-r, carat-l depending on the current context (RTL or LTR) would save applications having to swap these icons around themselves.

It would also be good if a proper RTL implementation also supported LTR within a RTL context for screens where multiple languages and orientations of text are required. I've done my best to try an implement that in my modifications, and have provided demos of that functionality.

1. I think you'll want a way to prevent horizontal scrolling when the panel is open. Our method was to give the body a class consisting of: position:fixed;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;overflow-x:hidden;.
2. It can be problematic if the height of the panel equals the height of the page, i.e. if a user open the panel using a link in the middle of the page, he/she can't see the navigation in the panel without scrolling to the top.
3. The ""pan"" display mode slides the panel in. My ideal visual effect is for the page to ""reveal"" the panel underneath.  :)

I suggest to move the popup example to its own page like the other ""advanced popup examples"". Right now your example won't work if you navigate from another page to the popup page because of our Ajax nav. We set ```data-ajax=""false"" on the links to the example pages to make sure the script is loaded.

We probably have to do something similar for the dialog example.

You append the popup to `div[data-role=""page""]` but I think this should be the active page.

You don't need to set a fixed width to solve this. The only problem is this part:



Change `bind` into `on` and it will work.

However, you don't need to set a  max-width at all, because the widget contains CSS for this and a tolerance functionality. Only thing you have to look into is max-height. See http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/popup-images.html

We will demonstrate how to handle the enhancement of the header and close button in an example in the docs.

This version is close to the version I'm currently using (with datatables). I have changed the custom select to native selects on my site, but for the new demo I changed native selects to popup, so you the widget now uses popup for the column toggles by default. I also JQM gridded the top and bottom wrappers.

There is a bunch of stuff in tableview which you probably don't need/want (filling the wrapper slots, auto adding a selectable-checkbox-column ...). I have labelled the js/css in the code, so you can just pick what you like. 

The tricky stuff also should more or less work - tricky being responsive columns with `multi-row table headers` (more than two will be too difficult to toggle) and table header cells usually having `non-JQM classes` in which case the original responsive example doesn't work.

What I haven't added yet is a wrapper-div around the table and slot elements. Without this, the plugin will run into trouble if  more than one tableview is in the DOM. I also still need to add the code for the select (vs popup) toggle menu and get the zebra function to work (odd/even theming table rows).

Let me know if you have any questions.

The tableview filter extension is 99% the same as the listview filter extension. 

I'm basically only changing names and switch between LI / TR elements. Maybe the listview filter extension can be made into a general filter extension, so it can be used across widgets vs. having almost duplicate code for filtering lists and tables?

ok. My 2cents: 
- I wouldn't close the popup after every check. I had used custom selects before switching to native selects and I sorely miss configuring the table in one step and not having to select over and over to get the layout I want. 
- prio 1-6 does seem like a lot. Unless you are aming for webTV.
- nice idea with the `abbr`
- curious to see what users say regarding theming options. The way I'm reading it now, you are stressing to keep the table ""bare"", but also provide a ton of classes to manually style the table. I kind of like the JQM way = data-theme=""done"". Adding classes for borders, backgrounds, et all manually does seem a little complicated compared to other widgets, don't you think? 
- and on my Firefox, this table isn't responsive at all :-)
",frequent,toddparker
5093,2012-10-22 22:33:28,"I agree with @frequent about auto-closing the popup. I think it'd be nice to keep it open while in use. I'm also curious if we think we need a popup plugin dependency here, as it'll add a bit of weight. 

Agreed on the number of priorities too, though I admittedly don't know what would be appropriate. It seems like a more simple system of having just high and low priority items would be enough for most cases.

As for theming, I'm still unsure about the role of the plugin and whether it makes sense to offer themed table styles at all, or just general show/hide behavior. The row styles feel more like a general table style that one might use in their website without jQM's helps, so I'm unsure if it's related to the ""responsive table"" widget. The less CSS boilerplate we add, the easier it'll be to configure the table to look different per website, and then our widget handles the hard part without doing all that much, visually. Our docs styles should style the table attractively but I'm not sure whether those styles should be part of the framework CSS at all.

Per the final bullet, The table isn't functional yet, so that makes sense :)

5093,2012-10-31 22:10:44,"Hi all

@toddparker and I have pretty much finished the first draft of the table plugins and documentation. You can check out the latest in the https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/tables branch.

The scripts for these plugins can be found in that branch's `js/widgets` folder - there are 3 tables scripts in all.

It's not currently updated with today's changes, but the branch preview is here as well: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/tables/docs/tables/index.html  ( @johnbender any chance we can refresh that?)

We're open to feedback on option naming, as well as anything else that stands out. 

The one outstanding code issue I'd like to fix is the [setTimeout used at the end of the columntoggle plugin extension](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/tables/js/widgets/jquery.mobile.table.columntoggle.js#L98).

Can you explain your reasoning for using strong here? These elements are purely for visual aid and are not exposed to any assistive technologies. In this case, I believe we've used `b` in accordance with HTML5's recommendation:  stylistic offset.
",scottjehl,jerone
5093,2012-11-01 15:29:04,"Hey @jerone!

Using the `b` tag actually makes sense here, semantically. `b` conveys that the text is stylistically offset from the surrounding text, without implying any additional importance—I admit it’s a pretty dubious sort of “semantic meaning,” but so says the spec.

By using `b`, we’re allowing the semantics of the parent `th` and `td` to define the contents of the `b` tag, unmodified. By using `strong` we’d effectively be saying “EVERY HEADING IS VERY IMPORTANT,” which is unnecessary. That may be the case in individual use cases, but we don’t want to assume it across the board.

I am very happy with the arrival of the new widget.
It can be very useful in many cases.

However, I have a point, there are two modes very interresting (reflow method and Column toggle mode), but there is a third possible.
Based on an idea by David Bushell : ""The tables change orientation on small screens. A horizontal scroll or swipe is used to view more data. The table head is always visible."" Here is an example : http://dbushell.com/demos/tables/rt_05-01-12.html

@scottjehl, @toddparker

Some late night thinking on using `$(window)` as global object with pageContainers:

(1)
I'm using two layers of JQM pages (wrappers and nested), so a page with containers would look like this. 



While I figured out a way to use JQMs current navigation to work with this setup, I like the idea of using `$( window )` as top-level object ""managing"" different types of pages (single page, multipage, pageContainers) vs having wrappers and nested pages. Much less confusion. 

(2)
Also, I ran into a lot of trouble when going from a page with pageContainers to another page with pageContainers.

Say you have:



If you navigate:



This can be fixed by exposing `documentUrl` and `documentBase` and resetting both when pulling in a new wrapper page with different `data-url` than the current  `documentUrl`. 

Again, I think running the navigation from the `$(window)` object would spare a lot of complexity here as you would always works from a global object.

(3)
Your approach feels like delegating from `$(window)` to a target container, which also sounds right. 

Say you'd use the `<body>` and pageContainers as ""viewports"", you should get a trackable path through the application as pages will either be loaded into the `<body>` or a `pageContainer`. There are a few caveats in reverting this in the history, but I tried with up to 4 panels and the same set of rules always apply.

(4) 
The only drawback I see is you would loose the option of having a global header/footer if widgets can't be initialized outside of a page.

Say you are using a wrapper page vs. running things from `$(window)`:



I guess once popups will be available globally, global toolbars won't be far behind, so I don't think this is really a problem down the road. 

Therefore:   `$(window)` would get my vote!

",johnbender,frequent
5091,2012-10-23 15:49:38,"@johnbender: thx. 

One important point I want to add:

(5) 
Best reason for using `$(window)` is if you can manage to handle the last backwards transition on a container, which currently is a nightmare of excepctions for me. 

Using above example:



Loading this page will create an entry for `base.html` in the `urlHistory`. If you do this:



you will get a 2nd entry in the `urlHistory`, which will be `three.html`. 

Now go back. You don't have `two.html` in the urlHistory.

What happens is inside `$.mobile._handleHashChange` you will end up with no `to` defined, so JQM will try to reload the first page `base.html` vs. reverting the last panel transition, which blanks the pageContainer in question.

I spend forever on this and I spare you the details, but you need a fwd/backwards transition counter, have a terrible check for the last panel backwards transition, hijack the trailing hashchange (it trails nothing, cause there is no `to` ), convert the trailing hashchange object to a string, have it pass so you get a transition, block everything it triggers and clean up the mess it makes in the urlHistory afterwards. 

This handler is about half of my panel navigation, so if using `$(window)` can catch the last backwards transition on a container and if the navigation has a handle for ""no to defined"", you should save yourself a ton of headaches. 
",frequent,johnbender
5091,2012-11-30 17:24:19,"@frequent 

We'll have to revisit that issue once I get this merged so I can fully understand it. It sounds like what we need in that case is a history stack per page container, which is something I had planned to push down to the container widget (1.4) 

I could be way off there though.
",johnbender,frequent

ok. I did my first multiview version like this = with every container keeping it's own urlHistory. I later switched to using JQMs urlHistory, which only required to add the container to the urlHistory like so (from almost latest):

5091,2012-11-30 18:27:23,"@toddparker 

Per your request an executive summary of the nav work:

There are two new additions to the navigation functionality in jQuery Mobile. A `navigate` event that normalizes the URL alteration events `hashchange`/`popstate`, and a `$.mobile.navigate` method that allows users to receive extended traversal information in `navigate` bindings (eg, directionality).  

The `navigate` event is a light weight attempt to unify bindings to a browser's URL alteration events `hashchange` and `popstate`. It also handles differences in the way setting the hash on the location object interacts with the two browser events (ie, stop the world `popstate` triggering) , and provides event hooks to control the event lifecycle.

The `$.mobile.navigate` method forms the bulk of the new functionality. By using the `$.mobile.navigate` method to do url manipulation instead of doing it directly with the `location` object, `replaceState`, or `pushState` you get history management and support for both modes of URL state tracking. The history management provides a state object to `navigate` event bindings whether the browser supports the new history API or not. In addition it contains the same logic used in jQuery Mobile to determine what direction the browser history is moving. 

Both the event and the method are available as modules apart from other navigation functionality in jQuery Mobile, with minor dependencies on other parts of the library.

I'm the author of one of those plugins, so I have a good understanding of this topic.

I'm aware that jQM won't support query parameters natively, since the previous behavior was more of a bug than an intended feature.

But the sample-reuse-page contains a certain pagebeforechange handler technique, which is the basis on which we can develop routing plugins.

Unfortunately, with 1.2.0-rc\* versions, we don't have the _first_ pagebeforechange with the string url anymore and thus we can't add support for query parameters to deep links (see #5080).

After tinkering some I did manage to get it all to position pretty correctly. The 'only' case where there's an issue on the demo page is the one which is `data-position-to=""window""` 
I'm doing a rudimentary check to see if an image is close to the bottom of the document and in that case nudging it's positioning up a little.  The other pop-ups seem to grow the document height so that's not an issue.

Not sure if this is worth pursuing at all?  In the bin I'm only doing modification if the UA tests true for Opera Mini and then adding an event on the clicking of the `data-rel=""popup""` links but we could perhaps refactor that to do that in the codebase to look just before render which would give us the benefit of working with the programmatical instantiated popups too.

@MauriceG and I already had a nice discussion about making it possible to set a default icon for listviews. See #4582.

I think we should keep things simple for users and not add new options if not really necessary. So I suggest to stick to one option ""icon"" with the following possibilities:

default = ""arrow-r""
1. [global] override the default for all listviews by using the `$.mobile` object
2. [UL/OL] override the default or global with `data-icon` on a listview _OR_ with the option `icon` if that listview is created programmatically
3. [LI] override any of the above for a list item with `data-icon` on that specific list item

",jerone,gabrielschulhof
5009,2012-11-26 11:56:55,"After a discussion with @uGoMobi we've come up with two possible solutions for adding active states to those buttons (be they links or form elements) that will cause the browser to tear down all of jQM as it shows a page via an HTTP request.
1. The CSS-based approach: We create a new class (ui-btn-active-remove - naming is up for discussion, of course) that is a CSS transition which basically negates the modifications introduced by ui-btn-active, but does so after a while. We apply this class during nav's click handler, when we determine that following the link would result in HTTP navigation. A central sumbit handler similar to the click handler might have to be added so we can also deal with form buttons that have had ui-btn-active added to them. We identified several consequences with this approach:
   1. The source page might become littered with applications of the class ui-btn-active-remove if the user repeatedly navigates over HTTP, then returns to the jQM page containing the HTTP links. The presence of these classes would have no visual effect, but it would be ""unsightly"". We could clean up during the click handler with a $( "".ui-btn-active-remove"" ).removeClass( ""ui-btn-active-remove"" ) if that turns out not to be expensive. For browsers that do not support CSS transitions, the application of ui-btn-active-remove would have the effect of immediately removing the modifications applied by ui-btn-active, so for those browsers [this issue](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5009) would not be fixed.
   2. There might be bugs similar to the problems that prompted introduction of popup interruptible transitions. For example, there is a (Chrome) browser bug that was not filed whereby, when clicking an AJAX link from a popup that leads to another page and later returning to the page containing the popup, one would see the final stages of the popup's closing transition on the source page, even though the time interval during which the closing transition was supposed to complete is much shorter than the time spent on the page opened from the popup.
   3. The class ui-btn-active-remove might have to be themed, and we'll have to apply one of ui-btn-active-remove-[a-z] at the time of vclick.
   
   _This approach hinges on the fact that we can essentially achieve the effect of removing .ui-btn-active by adding the class .ui-btn-active-remove and, furthermore, defining ui-btn-active-remove in such a way that, where browsers support CSS transitions, the transition is used to achieve the effect of removing ui-btn-active, and where browsers do not support CSS-transitions, the basic properties of the ui-btn-active-remove class will have the effect of removing ui-btn-active._ @Wilto should be able to weigh in here.
2. The [unload](http://api.jquery.com/unload)-based approach (as @jerone suggested): During the central click routing in jquery.mobile.navigation.js we make the determination as to whether we should handle a link via AJAX or whether we should let the browser handle it the normal way. At this point, if the decision is to let the browser handle it, we could add a one-shot unload handler that would remove the active state added during the central vclick handler the same way as the hashchange handler would remove such an active state. We might also have to introduce a central submit handler so as to add this one-shot unload handler for submit buttons as well.
   
   The challenge with this approach is that we must test that the unload event works reliably on all our supported platforms.

This only occurs on the initial state, that is a refresh. For all other back and forward combinations it does re-use the dialog hash key. I guess I'm not convinced that there's an enormous amount of value to making this kind of change this late in the release cycle.

If we want to add this after the release I think I'd be more open to it. I'm in #jquerymobile-dev to chat about it when you have a minute.
",johnbender,gabrielschulhof
4994,2012-09-18 16:28:31,"@gabrielschulhof 

Also, as I pointed out in the commit message, we can actually make use of the id reference that's currently included to ensure a hashchange when we want to re-use the current dialog state. That is if the default when a popup is clicked looks something like:

`http://foo.com/` --- click popup link ---> `http://foo.com/#foo&ui-state=dialog`

We can check if we're on the initial page and the location.hash is a match for the hash we're creating and just strip the id from it:

`http://foo.com/#foo&ui-state=dialog` --- click popup link ---> `http://foo.com/#&ui-state=dialog`

That would, at most, be a 2 to 3 line change, and accommodates the ""reuse"" of the existing hash. Also, it's not clear to me that we shouldn't use the identifier for popup hash state when we can since the semantics add value to the url.

This puts us in a really tough spot. 

On the one hand the change that @gabrielschulhof has proposed is fairly trivial and it appears as though it would help you out. 

On the other hand this is a _private_ method and we are already at the release candidate stage. 1.2 was in beta for something like a month when we could have made this change without concern. Again, it seems really trivial but making any code change during an RC is a risk.

",jjunkin,johnbender
4943,2012-09-25 20:46:16,"I've run into this exact same issue. What I'm creating is a mini web app that uses json data to compose the content. Pretty much like what's described in this example: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0-rc.1/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html

Project is relatively simple, there's no server generated pages, only the json data, but since it's running in a mobile web browser, page reloads are something to be expected. For now I'm using JQ1.7.2 and JQM1.2.0.alpha1 where page reloads work as expected, but this discussion makes me a bit worried about any similar future projects. This really sounds like there's been an architecture change where this behavior won't be possible anymore :\

@johnbender
I've tried what you've suggested here, but it just reloads the page over and over (as I thought it would...)

<pre><code>location.hash = location.hash.replace(/\?.*$/, """");</code>
<code>location.href = location.href;</code></pre>

When I only use this, 

<pre><code>location.hash = location.hash.replace(/\?.*$/, """");</code></pre>

Then as expected it removes query from the URL, and only the hash remains, which does cause at least the correct page to show up, but doesn't allow for proper deeper page reloads, linking or bookmarking. If that's the best workaround we can get, it's almost as bad as no workaround at all, I'm afraid :(<br>

I've done a bit more investigation on what happens on page reloads, and I've noticed that with JQ172 and JQM120a, there's two pagebeforechange events firing: First one has data.toPage as a String, the other one has it as an Object. In case of JQ181 and JQM120 post-alpha only one event is fired instead, the one where data.toPage is an object (which contains no data useful for rebuilding the URL).<br>

This is the reason why Router plugin now fails as well. Much like the JQM dynamic page example, Router code relies on this check: (typeof data.toPage === ""string"") to know when to do its work. But this will never evaluate to true on a page refresh in new JQM anymore :\

- I think these should default to not showing an icon, just like we do for the horizontal checks/radios. Maybe if you set the icons explicitly for the expanded/collapsed, we can show them but by default, not having icons leaves more room for text and makes these look more like tabs. 
- Since there isn't a physical connection between the header and content as there is in an accordion, I'd like to apply the active class to the expanded collapsible to show an on state.

Is this coded to handle any number of tabs (within reason)?
I also wonder if we should apply a content theme by default or just document that you should add this.

Sounds good. I agree with the icons (need a lot of space, will try to remove) and content-theme (make an option). I have set it up for 4 tabs right now, but maybe it can be done like the navbar to wrap to multiple lines (checking). Active state should already by there. I might have overwritten the CSS to not show it (also checking).

Yes. If you do it like that you will see that the PR will be a request to merge [your branch name] into master.

",frequent,toddparker
4865,2012-09-10 19:29:37,"@uGoMobi, @toddparker: need your feedback on some points.

1) (done) - keep active class on active collaspibles
2) (done) - if not specified, tabs are without icons by default
3) (need input!) - **max number of tabs**: This is tricky... 5 is no problem, also breaking to multiple lines if more than 5 tabs (same as navbar). I have been fiddling with another approach  ([dummy](http://www.franckreich.de/p/test.html)), where I'm trying to get by without setting any width/min-width on the tabs and just expand depending on text size while breaking to multiple lines on smaller screens. I have pretty much tried all CSS trickery I know but I can't fill the top row gaps when the screen shrinks. Do you have any idea if this is possible at all? If so, I would try making element four and five into first and last, so they would shrink/grow independently (so I can set corners). 

Todos:
4) (will do next) data-inset not working yet
5) (will do next) set up with/without data-content-theme
6) (what do you think?) **data-icons-only=""true""** on small screens if icons are specified on all collapsibles 
7) (what do you think?) **data-bottom-bar=""true""** to add a footer to the content section (sample coming up)
8) (what do you think?) **data-tabs=""left|right|bottom|top""** just an idea, but I saw a nice native app using sidebars along header/footer. I would give it a try and see if this is settable with a class and CSS, so the tabs would be the sidebar.

1 & 2 - Great. Is there an updated demo?
3 - I can see this getting complex. I'd vote to just to just max be 5 to avoid needing to stack to multiple rows because that's not good UI. 
4 - this will be a good one to get working
5 - this should work without, but I can see us recommending that they use a theme for better visual connection
6 - i see the appeal, but let's just truncate text for now and look at this later
7 - seems like we could just allow people to add a footer to the content and we can make sure the styles look ok. I wouldn't add anything more than that.

Thanks for all the work so far!

I had a look at your sample page and was wondering if we can think of a different approach to make the collapsible content full width and stick to the left. The problem with the fixed width is that you have to set the padding of the collapsible content to 0. Using box-sizing border-box would solve this for most browsers, but unfortunately IE7/8 and WP don't support this.

In my knowledge, location.toString cannot be overwritten, even if it can do, it will not necessarily work in the future.

I just forgot location.search, location.href without user:pass is
`location.protocol + ""//"" + location.host + location.pathname + location.search + location.hash`
it also works on file:// url.

It's not related but important, ""isSameDomain"" can load http page from https page.
I think isSameOrigin is required for more strict security.

Hi,

user:pass in location.href is dependent on browser's implementation.
Non-webkit browsers remove user:pass in location.href by default.

It is not necessary to consider percent encoding.

Seems your idea for using encode/decodeURIComponent works in chrome and IE but not FF. 
Firefox likes to automatically decode the url in the address bar thus making a refresh of the page impossible. It seems to only apply the decoding when an encoded character is found, this includes removing the hash which identifies which page jqm should navigate to.
Try putting this url in both Firefox and Chrome/IE and you can see what I mean

http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1/docs/pages/multipage-template.html#two?arg1=%2Ffoo%2Fbar

This still isn't working....in Firefox the URL displayed in the address bar is still displaying decoded and missing the hash (#)...so when you refresh on the URL, the page doesn't reload. 

There were still a handful of places that were using the location.hash.

I see there is a a second ""new"" way to work around this issue that was implemented, but I don't think its fully solving this problem and I don't quite understand why.

Going back to an earlier post....I got this working myself in the 1.1.1 release by simply just changing **everywhere** that `location.hash` was being **read** with `$.mobile.path.parseUrl( location.href ).hash`

I also went through the stable 1.1.1 release and changed every  `location.hash`, `$.mobile.path.parseLocation().hash` and `path.parseLocation().hash` with `$.mobile.path.parseUrl( location.href ).hash` and its working for me.

Regarding the location.hash only having one more reference, I just found the following areas in the 1.1 stable release where I think the location.hash should be changed to use the `$.mobile.path.parseUrl( location.href ).hash` function. I think that changing all of these as well as all the places where parseLocation().hash is being used fixes the issue for me.

Actually controlgroup() is just a function that takes options as parameter. It is not a real widget. This means there are no methods like `controlgroup( ""refresh"" )` or `triggger( ""create"" )`. There is just a call to the function: `controlgroup()`.

This is the code in jquery.mobile.init that should make sure controlgroups are enhanced:

Hi John, thanks for looking at  this.  @ninichki already got it working.

I've suggested that Gabriel take a look, because in this case, the popup is called and the click is not ignored, like the docs say.

4727,2012-07-26 17:58:33,"History aside i think this would still be a good option because in some situations you may just want to stop the popup from being closed by accident. this way it would force them to actually hit a close button or something similar. I have a popup that is opened pragmatically. i don't mind the popup being closed by the user and am not worried about back button. i just want the user to have to click either close or next vs potentially closing by accident by clicking outside. 

Also in regards to the backbutton issue here and on issue #4649 This option would solve #4649 in some situations (though not all) on devices without a physical back button (ios) in phonegap or standalone mode this would solve. (not sure how the physical back button works in phonegap in android??) 

finally the situation @gabrielschulhof noted with a popup on a page with hash listening disabled and (if such an option existed) history not being tracked for popup just have it go back to last page in history this seems like what the expected result of such a sequence would be to me. and if this isnt the desired sequence then that would be up to the person creating the pages to handle properly. 

i have a modified version of the popup widget working with both options i'm trying to polish up for fringe cases and it seems to work well if this is of any interest i'm happy to share. (i'm sure it would need some reworking before actually being used!)

Hi, the fix does not work for me because I need to skip the filtering after I injected new data items in the list (I used to change the 'lastval' variable from outside the class but I realize that was an ugly hack so I changed your code a little bit and now it work find and it's clean (I hope) :



Let me explain the modifications: 
first I do need to know what is the value of the input text so I added two parameters to the event you created
(if I don't have this value I can't fill the list with my custom item values)
then when I fill the list with new items (all items are removed then new ones are added) : it means that they don't need to be filtered after.

in my event catch function I call event.preventDefault(); which means skip filtering;



note about filtering : 
why do I added code to chane  val and lastval variables?:
if I don't set val and lastval to """" then a search with accends won't work (exemple : enter ""côte"" the 'ô' would be filtered but I want it to be considered as a regular 'o')

I hope you understand my issues because it's not very easy for me to explain. ;)

Nicolas.

If you alter the $.listview.prototyope.options.filterCallback to be a no-op or something more complex, does that work in conjunction with the event? 

I made a suggestion in the pull request that we include the search field as a data item on the event, or simply expose the search field somehow so that users's can bind to it as they please thereby avoiding any use case predictions.

Would making the search field available, either as event data or as an attribute, allow you to do what you want?

4678,2012-07-12 07:06:42,"@MauriceG Hi Maurice, yes this was a comment related to your 12 PRs for changing scheme to theme, not just specific to this one in particular. Setting the theme will apply a color scheme (i.e. colors that work together, including background color, widget color(s) and text color), so that's why I was saying I think color scheme can be ok. In the case of overlay theme for popup or dialog, then we are talking about just the one color, so maybe scheme is not appropriate. This is a very specific point, and this is why I would like @toddparker 's opinion. Also, throughout the docs we have used swatch, swatch or theme, but never ""color theme"". So that's why I am not in favor of ""color theme"". It will be applied to these docs and also the api docs and I want to make sure we make the right decision here, so that it doesn't get changed more than once. So hopefully we can resolve this today. 

Thank you :)

If we are going to make a change, I think the best turn of phrase is ""theme color swatch"" (or ""theme's color swatch"" but I think that feels odd for some reason even if more correct) because the theme is the overarching collection and it contains a number of color swatches. I think we use this elsewhere in the docs. 

So:
""Sets the color scheme (swatch) for the popup background""

Would become:
""Sets the theme color swatch for the popup background""

I had to revert the commit because multiple checkboxradio tests failed after landing this PR.

This could be because we have to rewrite the tests so they match the new situation, but it could also be that allowing links inside the checkbox label/button is causing problems in real.
I didn't see them while testing the fiddle you created, but it requires more investigation. For example, we need to test if the (virtual) events still fire.

This fix seems to have broken the layout of a navbar and a list combined on android 2.3.x when list text is too long to display.  issue [#4958](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4958)  
For some reason it is interferring with the overflow property of the list on the same page.
I can confirm that the following settings for `.navbar ul'` alleviate the issue of issue #4958 so perhaps substituting one of these will also fix this issue without breaking backward compatibility or we may need to revert back to @johnbender's original javascript solution.

Sorry, I missed to answer on this issue. @mspisars is correct, I'm pulling in a lot of dynamic content via Ajax, so for stuff like news messages, I use a shell page and pull in/out blocks of content (including popups). Content blocks are removed using remove(), but - understandably - this will probably not remove any dependent elements outside of the ditched content. 

So right now, I feel like uninstalling something from windows and having all sorts of leftover files cluttering the DOM :-D

Just thinking... could elements such as the overlay have a data-dependency-on=""some_element_id"" to auto-remove once the dependent element is removed (but how to check without wasting resources)?

The framework doesn't support mini styling for listview. There is no specific CSS for it and the mini data-attribute or option will be ignored. So if you configure buttonMarkup to give listview buttons mini styling anyway you might run into some issues.

Nevertheless, I will give that change another look. If it turns out not to be really necessary I will revert it to `.ui-mini { margin-top: .25em; margin-bottom: .25em; }`.

I think I already understand what is the issue with the slider handle in your case. The slider widget uses a different class for mini styling (ui-slider-mini). Since you configured button markup the ui-mini class is added anyway. This is causing the issue.

In general I don't think it's a good idea to configure buttonMarkup and would advice to set the mini option for each widget that you use.

The issue I wanted to prevent by adding .ui-btn to the selector is already taken care of by other changes so I am going to revert it.

4644,2012-07-04 15:17:33,"@bernharduw 

Yes, it should be safe to cofigure shadow and icon shadow that way.
The difference with options like mini and inline is that the ui-shadow and ui-icon-shadow classes are defined global in the theme CSS instead of specific rules for each component. The same goes for the corner styling.

Thank you for answer, but as I said, preventing default action is the workaround, at least for iOS Safari (I haven't tested it on Android yet). Anyway, I bet it would be better if you leave the choice for developers, because that additional 300ms make any app sluggish and slow and I think it whittles down all the benefits of using html5 and your great framework for real mobile developement..

Plus I cant see how collapsible toggling can change the content at the tap point, because it's always collapsible header over there, isn't?

I have been thinking about the footer as well. That certainly qualifies as ""subtle"". Downside is that you might find out you have been reading the wrong information only after you reached the bottom of the page.

Something I have been thinking about is adding (small) breadcrumbs at the top of the content div and add the version to the first crumb. For example:

Docs 1.1.1. > Pages > Dialogs

That might also improve the search results on Google. That's another issue mentioned at #3330. Probably best would be if the title contains the version, but I think that would mean we have to hardcode it :(

It took some time to figure out why and under which conditions, and it comes down to **the xhr post request not working in XHTML5 IF the page is run locally** (either from the file system or from localhost), at least on Windows 7. Is this a XHTML(5) feature, or a bug?

To replicate, 
- save your jsbin samples as files locally, make sure you make the  HTML5 version's extension ""html"", and the XHTML5 version's ""xhtml"". **Note**: I have provided a valid XHTML5 version, see http://jsbin.com/enewuc/4 
- Now open each local file (or locally served page) in a browser, and you'll see that while the HTML5 version issues an xhr request (leading to an error, which is correct), **the XHTML5 version does not execute the xhr request**, it does nothing (which is bad).

4583,2012-07-15 16:59:17,"@agcolom Hi Anne,

Thanks for the hint, there were indeed a few minor markup issue that have now been fixed:
- http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fform-submit-html-jqm.herokuapp.com
- http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fform-submit-xhtml-jqm.herokuapp.com
- http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fform-submit-xhtml.herokuapp.com

Despite the (now perfectly valid) polyglot markup, the initial issue remains:
- **HTML5 with JQM** [clicking 'Sign up' **works** (leads to an expected error, ""Error Loading Page"")] http://form-submit-html-jqm.herokuapp.com/
- **XHTML5 with JQM** [clicking 'Sign up' **DOESN'T WORK** (nothing happens)] http://form-submit-xhtml-jqm.herokuapp.com/
- **XHTML5 without JQM** [clicking 'Sign up' **works** (leads to an expected error page, ""The page you were looking for doesn't exist."")] http://form-submit-xhtml.herokuapp.com/

Note that for the XHTML versions, the HTTP response header intentionally sets the _correct_ Content-Type ""application/xhtml+xml"" if the user agent accepts it, and ""text/html"" otherwise.

**Now things get interesting:** For testing, you can force the response header to set the Content-Type to ""text/html"" for the XHTML versions by adding the request parameter ""format=html"" like this: http://form-submit-xhtml-jqm.herokuapp.com/?format=html ... and now the submit works - because the (valid!?) content-type ""application/xhtml+xml"" was changed to ""text/html"", which yields a fourth scenario:
- **XHTML5 with JQM served as ""text/html""** [clicking 'Sign up' **works** (leads to an expected error, ""Error Loading Page"")] http://form-submit-xhtml-jqm.herokuapp.com/?format=html

Is it wrong to expect JQM to work with Content-Type ""application/xhtml+xml""?
Anything else you suspect I'm doing wrong?

4582,2012-07-04 14:56:15,"hi @MauriceG 

I think the default for listview option icon should be `icon: ""arrow-r""` instead of `icon: """"`.

If we make it an option for listview we have to offer the possibility to set it with a data-attribute on the listview, not only programmatically. That's not in your code, right?

The value for the option icon for the call to buttonMarkup is now a very long line with OR statements. I suggest to create a variable.

That variable should be a function that checks if data-icon is set on the listview item. If not it should fall back to the data-icon attribute of the parent listview. If that has not been set as well it falls back to the option which is ""arrow-r"" by default but can be configured programmatically.

BTW - When we make this change we should not forget to update the listview options page in the docs and the data-attribute reference.
",jaspermdegroot,MauriceG
4582,2012-07-07 22:33:59,"hi @MauriceG 

You are right, it does work! Most probably I am the one who missed something here.

Below you'll see the code that I had in mind. This is basically the same thing written in another way, but with one difference.

That is `listIcon = $list.jqmData( ""icon"" ) || o.icon` which is required in this construction to see if `data-icon` is set on the `ul` with `data-role=""listview""`. This is why I thought that part was missing in your PR.

To be honest, I still don't understand how this works in your code. I only see `icon = item.jqmData(""icon"");` which checks if `data-icon` is set on the `li`.
Maybe you can explain it to me.

If I look at http://test.jqmobile.de/js/widgets/listviewSetIcon.js which is loaded by your test page, I see your code how it was after the first commit. It doesn't include the changes of the second commit. Am I right?

I had a look at `_getCreateOptions` and now (finally) understand how this works. Thanks!

When I test your code (after the second commit) I see it works, except for one thing. The `data-icon` set on the `ul` with `data-role=""listview` doesn't override the configured default. I think we do need to check with `listview.jqmData ( ""icon"" )` to make this possible.

We shouldn't use new option names if not necessary, because that is not user friendly. So `listIcon` should be `icon` and if we don't use ""arrow-r"" here as default is should be `null` instead of `""""`.

I'm not sure if this is something you can save to your iOS homescreen, but I'm definitely seeing the before and after effect of setting the animation-fill-mode properties in Chrome v19.0.1084.56 on OSX 10.6.8.  In the examples, I'm explicitly setting the .in and .out styles in an overriding &lt;style&gt; block that's defined in the jsfiddle below the &lt;script&gt; and &lt;link&gt; tags in the &lt;head&gt;.  That's to show that it is the only difference.  All external script and css files being used are the same.

Here's the jsfiddle with the default .in and .out styles from the official 1.1. release.

You will see the blink forward/back ""glitch"" if you simply click either ""Artists"" or ""Queue"" link from the index page, then click ""Back"" to go back.  Do that a few times and you should see a flash of the index page after transitioning to the Queue or Artists page, and then you should see a flash of the Queue or Artists page when going back to the index page.

I wasn't able to see any difference on my iPhone 4S running iOS 5 either in Safari or as a fullscreen app but I can see that this does reduce the blinkiness that sometimes happens on Chrome. It's subtle, but it is measurably better. I don't think this will cause any issues, so I'm going to pull this into master and live with it for a while to see if any oddness shakes out with all the various transitions and scenarios. If there aren't any issues, we can look at picking this over for a future maintenance release of 1.1.x.

Just to be clear. `urlHistory` in your description means the browsers history correct? You're saying that the back button recalls the scroll location for that history entry from the browsers internal representation and sets that before the transition logic runs and sets the value as assigned to `active.lastScroll`?

I'm confused because it also sounds like you're saying that we're doing two scrolls down from the top of the page.

If the former is the case I'm wondering if we can do a comparison and avoid the second scroll when the position ""close enough"".

",johnbender,dcarrith
4543,2012-06-22 02:07:08,"@johnbender - I've become obsessed with tracking down this issue.  But, I think I have exhausted all of my troubleshooting energy.  I simply can't figure out the source of the jump down to the last scroll position of the page we're going back to.  

Here are some of the scenarios I tested and the results.  Maybe you or one of the other devs can make some sense out of it.     

Just so we're on the same page, the call to window.history.back() is in the block of code on lines 1312 - 1316 of jquery.mobile.navigation.js (however, I also removed this piece from the overall equation and the issue still occurs - see the last section starting with ""It's also worth mentioning..."" for more info on that scenario).   

In my test scenario, I have the main index page, an artists page, and an albums page showing the albums for a particular artist.  If I scroll down the list of artists and select one, I get to the albums page.  Then, if I click the back button (my own back button or the browser back button) I see a scroll down to the last scroll position of the artists page before the transition even starts.  

As a quick test, I also set my default transition to 'none' and confirmed that the issue still occurs.  

I also fiddled around with different combinations of the changeHash, hashListeningEnabled and pushStateEnabled settings (set in mobileinit).  For example, I tried this combination:  

$.mobile.changePage.defaults.changeHash = true;
$.mobile.hashListeningEnabled = false;
$.mobile.pushStateEnabled = false;

The erroneous scroll down to last position of the page we're going back to (artists page) still occurs, and so does the update to the location.hash, but the page doesn't transition to the previous page (because the hash listening is disabled of course). 

This is also interesting...Even with $.mobile.minScrollBack set to 1000 in my mobileinit, the erroneous scroll down to last position of the page we're going back to STILL occurs.  However, in that case, when it actually transitions back to the artists page, the scrollTo last position does not trigger since the minScrollBack is set so high.  This kind of makes me think that the issue lies with jQuery itself, or in the browser (I've tested the latest version of Chrome on OSX as well as Firefox).  I have tried console.log'ing the history object right before the call to window.history.back() to see if scroll position is even being tracked by the browser and it is NOT.  So, that leads me to believe it might be an issue in the core jQuery library.  My step through debug sessions always led me to the core jQuery library but then I always ended up getting lost or my script debug session would freeze up (not sure what's going on there).  However, the problematic area seemed to be around line 2940 of jquery-1.7.2.js.  I've also tried using jquery-1.7.1 and 1.7.0 but the same issue occurs.  

It's also worth mentioning that I am also able to recreate the issue by removing the data-rel=""back"" attribute from my back button and adding the following event listener for the back button:

$('body').on('click', '#header-back-link', function(evt) {



});

If I add this line above the call to window.history.back():

$.mobile.urlHistory.ignoreNextHashChange = true;

The erroneous scroll down to last position of the page we're going back to (artists page) still occurs, and so does the update to the location.hash, but of course, the page doesn't transition to the previous page because the hash change is being ignored.

I'll try to get a video screen capture posted on vimeo so you can see what I'm talking about.  I'm curious if anyone has ever noticed this before, or has it just been lumped in with the ""jumpy transitions"" kind of issues.

4535,2012-06-18 23:16:56,"@johnbender: thanks for the feedback.  I guess I was looking at it the other way...you're already tracking history in urlHistory.  So, why not use it in place of window.history.back() since it can solve part of the larger issue (jumpiness) that is probably one of the top reported issues for Android.         

""...the addition of logic to the click handler solves less than 50% of the cases and adds additional complexity in [an] already over complex module""     

Can you elaborate on that statement?  What do you mean by ""less than 50% of the cases""?    

Similarly, I'm not sure what you're referring to when you say ""a solution that resolves this issue in both cases"".  What test cases (both) are you talking about?

Personally, I prefer to fix issues even if it means adding a little complexity to the code base.  
",dcarrith,johnbender
4535,2012-06-18 23:26:18,"@dcarrith 

Android devs (as an example group) don't make use of explicit back buttons and google actually counsels developers to omit them from their applications in preference to the hardware back button. In the browser, that means supporting a hash change back through history without any reference to where the event came from. So my totally arbitrary estimation of 50% is meant to capture an enormous set of use cases where this issue will still exist because going back through history happens frequently without an explicit addition of the back button.

Therein lies my interest in a more general solution that prevents us from special casing our back buttons which adds not only code but a requirement for ""code base"" knowledge when dealing with back buttons. That is, with your proposed/pullrequest  you need to know how the framework behaves when someone creates a `data-rel=back` link and also how it behaves when someone hits the back button. 

All that said, I agree with your closing statement. If we can't come up with a way to handle this is both cases then might just need to eat the extra complexity in the interest of improving explicitly included back buttons.

While you were posting this comment I received test results from RIM for the Curve which confirms what you already noticed... there is still an issue there because of the different screen width.
We also concluded that we had to test on the Storm since this model has been shipped with BB5 and has different screen width as well.

- Under form, in the slider input, 1 digit gets cut off from lack of space
  
  Fixed
- Button Outside UI Grid is wider than the other buttons (On all tests this occurred, including computers)
  
  In the current situation buttons have left/right margin by default. This way you can not align them with other components. Therefor I removed that margin and only added it where really needed (i.e. inline buttons and buttons in grids). Only downside of this is that when you combine two or more buttons with a single full width button. The first go in a grid and have margin and the last not. As a ""solution"" I added a note in the docs (part of the first commit above) that when you can wrap a button in a div with ui-grid class and then it will get the same margin.
  I should have mentioned on the test page that I added that button outside the grid on purpose to show the difference.

[UPDATE:] I just found out we have a class ui-grid-solo for this. Will update the note in the docs.
- The 2 Select buttons cut off the text within it on the right (only mobile)
  
  I used this example because the issue I fixed was about the select button being misaligned next to a regular button. Using a custom multiple select menu like this is not really good practise.
  What happens is that the multiple select has class has-count from the beginning, even when the count bubble isn't visible yet. So there is also extra padding. This makes the available space for text so small that some browsers don't even show an ellipsis anymore. Same goes for the three buttons at the top of the grid where I didn't see text at all when testing Opera Mini, but I see similar issues when I resize Chrome browser to smallest possible width.
  I was able to optimize it a little bit, but I don't think we can really fix this.
- Under Control Group, Horizontal, Some of the ""X"" buttons are misaligned or completely out of the box underneath them. Menu Button overlaps Search Button. (Opera Mobile and Mini)
  
  Fixed
- Under Form, Cannot select any ""Choices"" (Full size or mini). The popup menu comes up for a second, than disappears. In the old one it works fine. (Opera Mobile)
  
  I could not reproduce this on the Opera Mobile emulator, but that was after I already made a few changes. So maybe I fixed it without knowing. Other possibility is issues with fiexed toolbars. I changed the header and footer of the test page to inline.

The button gets the active state when there is an action in progress. In your example the first button contains a function, which means there is an action and the button gets the active state. With the second button there is no action so also no active state. This is expected behaviour, yes.

I now understand, after the update from @agcolom, that you don't see the ""down state"" either. This has to do with buttonMarkup.hoverDelay. You can read more about this on this page in the docs http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html
You can configure this setting by adding the code shown below in the head before you load the jQuery Mobile JS. See http://jsbin.com/ovesir/2/edit



Default is 200 and I changed it to 100, but you can play with it to see what works best.

Regarding the active state. You could still use href=""#"" but then you need to make your function add and remove the active class.



As an alternative you could change the styling of the down state to make that look like the active state.

Buttons with href=""#"" don't get active state by design, this is not a bug. Maybe we have to give the default value for hoverDelay another look. Closing for now, but feel free to comment if the suggestions above doesn't solve your issue.

See the page in the docs @MauriceG pointed you at. It shows you on which events you can call preventDefault.
In general there is no need to create a pause when you bind to the pagebeforecreate event to manipulate the content. If for some reason this doesn't work for your specific use case, binding to the pagebeforeload event like Maurce suggested could be the solution.

Since this doesn't concern a bug I am closing the issue and would like to refer you to the jQuery forum where you can ask for help.

One quick note here. If you can it's helpful to pull them apart into discrete bits. For example this could be two pull requests, one for caching the `cTypeIsInPut`, and one the calculation changes/other.

At the very least it's good to split those into different commits so they can be dealt with individually. This will probably sit in the queue a while longer until someone gets the time to look over everything and how it interacts, unless you want to split it up.

domain.com/mobile

domain.com/mobile/page2
domain.com/mobile/page3

For all pages the base href is ""http://domain.com/"", but JQM expects the base href for mobile/page1 to be ""http://domain.com/mobile/"", which breaks all images and links. If JQM respected the base href value on the page it fetched via AJAX, everything would work fine. My solution of setting the static base href for all mobile seemed like an easier and quicker one to implement.

Note that this would be a problem even if I had the mobile site at domain.com/. It might not be immediately obvious because the problem would start only occurring when I get to the two-segment URL paths:

domain.com - would work
domain.com/page1 - would work
domain.com/page2 - would work
domain.com/page2/page3 - wouldn't work, because JQM would set the base href to domain.com/page2

Nevertheless, I'd be happy to take a stab at pulling it out of the AJAX response if that's how you would prefer to see it work.

4456,2012-08-16 20:55:56,"@johnbender It looks like this solution doesn't work in our case. In the site I'm implementing this on, the homepage of the JQM site is in ""mobile/"". The base href value, however, is simply ""http://domain.com/"". Links to internal pages all begin with ""mobile/"" (for example ""mobile/page1"", ""mobile/page2""). When I click one of these pages, I see the request for the page is to ""http://domain.com/mobile/mobile/page1"". So the URL on the link is still being concatenated with the href value of the link.

4456,2012-08-16 21:02:22,"@johnbender That last sentence is wrong. It should say: The href value of the a tag is being concatenated on the relative path of the current page (or so it seems).

",lthurston,johnbender
4456,2012-08-16 21:22:32,"@johnbender Sorry to spam you, I should have got this all into one message.

It looks like the call to getClosestBaseUrl() on line 4115 still returns ""http://domain.com/mobile"", to which ""mobile/page1"" is appended. So, the link ends up being incorrect.

This is the part of the code where, in reviewing my solution, I check to see if $.mobile.staticBaseHref is defined and if so I use it as the base url. Alternatively, with your approach, you could get the base href value from the DOM and stick it into the baseUrl variable at that point, if $.mobile.dynamicBaseEnabled is set to false:

Sadly the first one is the only one we can't put in the framework CSS. Like Todd said, people can set the radius to anything they like and this would override their setting. If you want fully rounded buttons you can add it as a workaround to your custom CSS.

Thanks for the [PR](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4621)!

There are a few more leaky places you could look at, if you'd like:
- [fixedToolbar](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L117): It does a lot of `$el.closest( "".ui-page"" ).bind( ... )` meaning that, if you remove it from the page, the binding stays attached to the page.
- [navbar](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/navbar.js#L48) also attaches handlers to the closest page, and so it would leak similarly to fixedToolbar
- [loader](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/loader.js#L86) does a bunch of $window.bind(...) and $window.unbind(...), but I can't tell from a cursory glance whether or not it leaves some bindings in place if you were to destroy the widget.

Fixing these should allow us to close this issue.

Our widgets need to implement `_destroy()` so as to roll back changes they made during `_create()` (such as e.g. new DOM elements), but they can rely on the `_destroy()` inside `$.Widget` to remove the bindings.

Also the problem with the fixed header toolbar positioning is still there.
The cause for the flash of content being displayed for both the to and from page is obvious in the code. The 'to' page is set to active (display: block) and then a scrollPage() takes place. So, for the duration of the scroll, the content of both pages occupy the viewport.

The ui-page-pre-in class sets the opacity of the to page to 0. This solution hides the to page while the scrollPage() processing is happening ( the root cause of the problem ). This works for me ( although I would say that the simultaneous transition code is getting a bit ""patchy"" - a day to refactor the code would be a good thing ).

The idea is that not only static list items get that class, but all buttons. So for clickable buttons it would be an extra class which would also be very useful for making the active/focus state themable. 

At first I thought we had to duplicate background, but that isn't necessary. Same goes for border, color, etc..
We could move all properties except background-image from ui-btn-up-a to ui-btn-a. Hover and down state rules can stay the same.

4340,2012-05-31 13:46:15,"Hey everyone. 

So, I did a little digging through commits to provide a little context into this line. It was added during the early releases to clean up a trail of focus/hover states that we were seeing while navigating jQM apps. Basically, focusing/tapping on another button on the page wasn't effectively blurring a button previously in focus, so button states were getting out of line.

While working on the problem, I'm fairly sure we tried manually triggering focus() on the clicked link (as @dcarrith kindly suggested above), but it still wasn't effectively blurring (or perhaps more specifically, triggering `mouseout` on) the other buttons on the page. This would be worth re-testing. I think the problem was most commonly seen in iOS, but it may have been on Android browsers as well.

Here's the commit
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/823485ce11ebb28dadf2b3b51f23f305ba0b314b

In hindsight, the change was overly-agressive, and the performance findings above verify that. Really, we just needed to find only the buttons in the active page that have stale states and remove their classes.

With our theme framework, this is a little trickier than it sounds. States are tied to letter-based themes, so the hover and focus state classes are variable. The blur and vmouseup handlers bound to these buttons keep track of that button's theme classes, so triggering blur on them was at least a clean way to clean things up. In the end, using the event triggers still might be the best approach; that said, I think we can remove the performance problem by minimizing the number of buttons that we're blurring by using a smarter selector (looking for class attributes that contain values with those prefixes).

Looking at the [buttonMarkup plugin](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/823485ce11ebb28dadf2b3b51f23f305ba0b314b), the blur event removes the following classes from a button: `ui-btn-hover-[theme]`, `ui-btn-down-[theme]`, and `ui-focus`. 

So those are the classes we'll need for our lookup. Something like the following might work...



In a brief console test, that seems to winnow it down to just what we need.

Anyone have time to give that some analysis?

4340,2012-06-21 23:32:35,"Alight @scottjehl figured out the root of the issue here. In 1.0, we first scrolled to the top of the page before starting a transition. In 1.1, we wanted to avoid this jump so we now fade the page out first by default. As it turns out, devices like an iPhone seem to keep the page above your scroll position in memory when doing a transition, but not the part of the page below.

So if you're on a long, complex page like the listview performance page with 500 items, clicking the first list item will work pretty well, but one halfway down will be very slow and a bottom one will crash the browser. Why? Because the browser is trying to animate a really massively tall page when scrolled down due to how it handle things. Test here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-performance.html

As a test, we added another condition to say that if you're either coming or going to a page where the scroll position is 3x the height of the device's screen, skip the transition. This makes the navigation back to it's snappy self. You'll notice we're using scroll position, not screen height here because I can navigate to a 10,000 pixel tall page fine but if I need to navigate away from that same page when scrolled down (or nav back to this with a scroll position restored), it will need way more memory to run the transition and could be slow or fail.

This 3x value is just a starting point, we can use whatever criteria we want. Here is the change to line 28 in jquery.mobile.transition.js to give this a spin:

`none = !$.support.cssTransitions || maxTransitionOverride || !name || name === ""none"" || Math.max( $( window ).scrollTop(), toScroll ) > screenHeight * 3,`

The question is how to layer this in. Do we just pick a value for this for 1.1.1 as a safely valve for performance now, then expose a config option for 1.2 to set the criteria? This is parallel to `maxTransitionOverride` - this sets the screen width that shuts off transitions automatically, this new one is like ```maxTransitionScrollOverride''' where we nix transitions based on vertical scroll position. Naming could be cleaned up to make this clearer.

@gseguin or @johnbender - do you want to give this a look and think about how we should get this in?

Before i create the PR can you give feedback on this:

(on page ""Anatomy of a Page"" new paragraph right below the one starting with ""PLEASE NOTE"" at the bottom of the page)

The id attributes of elements need to be not only unique on a given page, but also unique across the pages in a site. This is because jQuery Mobile's single-page navigation model allows many different ""pages"" to be present in the DOM at the same time. This also applies when using a multi-page template, since all ""pages"" on the template are loaded at once.

Thanks!

I have objections :-)
First off, I think the chances of using jqmobile inside node.js are very slim and the advantage of strict mode (potentially higher performance and a vastly improved error detection rate) doesn't make it worthwhile to support node.js without an actual use case.
Here's my killer argument: jQuery itself (see https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/outro.js) uses `window` - so there is a dependency anyway. And there really is no way to use it in node.js - `window` is mainly used for event handling on the dom and size- and orientation handling of the viewport. IMHO it's not overly realistic to use jqm in another context, as that would have to be preceded by massive rewrites. You really wouldn't use node's `this` for jqm. And you shouldn't. The required monkeypatching would be a mess.
And you don't really know beforehand if any other context you would use it in even supports the API you require for `this`.

While I agree that there's an issue to fix here, I'm not sure we should disable auto-initialization of button and input elements to fix it. Am I right in thinking that's what this change does? Auto-init'ing `button` elements into button widgets (without requiring `data-role=button` is similar to auto-init`ing`select`, text inputs, and others - it's an expected behavior of the framework. @toddparker do you agree?

To ensure buttons within toolbars default to mini (while still allowing them to be overridden with `data-mini=false`, it seems like we could adjust the logic in the mini default value. 

Changing line 27 of buttonMarkup.js to the following does the job, but it's ugly and not very readable. Perhaps you'd have time to tinker? I used a closure within the ternary to avoid calling jqmData() twice, but still, there's surely a better way.

",Wilto,arschmitz
4253,2012-05-03 19:59:44,"@jblas - got it. To navigate with page parameters, doing this on pagebeforechange is all I need:



This keeps a single page in the DOM, updates the URL correctly (and Coldfusion does not moan about two url.types in page.cfm?type=old#page.cfm?type=new... pheew...). I'm not sure if I need the _allowSamePageTransition_, but I want to sit back now and watch it work a couple of times, before re-fiddling.

Quick side note: 
In your first link [JQM docs](http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html) (first link above), I'm supposed to block the original event on pagebeforechange first, then config options, then fire a new changePage. 

Besides this being really easy to loop my browser into oblivion, it can be done without preventDefaulting and firing a new changepage, too. Just let the original event run through with modified options. This works so much better. Less event-baggage, you always have the options from the original event available (_fromPage_ being my favorite MIA in multiview) and I'm not starting with urlHistory and changehash. 

I've been sitting on this for a while doing panel-navigation on pagebeforechange and found it working much better if you just ""kick"" the original changepage in the right direction vs. firing a new changepage. If you use the 300ms vclick ""headstart"" to grab/temp-store the click event-target & data, you can also manage click-transitions and programmatic changepage calls through a single function. 

I'm helped, so closing this. Thanks!

The refetched page will have _data-external-page_ set to true. Do you know of an easy way to make the refetched page behave like the actual first (anchor) page in the DOM?

I guess I'll look at it again but to the original issue are you saying that the only way to enable page-level swipe events on a page that has a slider would be to use the pagination plugin?  Perhaps I'm just misunderstanding your suggestion.

Is there no other easier way to prevent slide events on a slider element from propagating any higher up the DOM as a swipe event?  It seems on the surface that it would be more appropriate for slider move events to not be propagated at all beyond the slider element itself.

1) @MauriceG in your jsFiddle it says that, absent a theme, swatch c is the default for the page.  Can you point me to where that behavior is documented?  That seems really important, but it was news to me.  I had assumed that the default would be ""a"" everywhere.  There's probably a great doc page that I'm missing.

2) @uGoMobi yes, what you're saying does correct my understanding of how things work. I guess I had assumed that if the footer is black (per theme a) and the only thing in the footer was a navbar (which I'd assume is super common, since it looks the most like the default iphone navbar) then the navbar would be black as well.  But, I'll create another swatch with black buttons to handle this scenario.

4164,2013-06-27 11:28:00,"Hi,
as far as I can see the animations in jqm 1.3.1 for the flip switch directly modifies the `left` and `width` property of elements. This causes a lot of layouts, which is slow. The solution would be to use css animations / transitions when available or don't execute the animations when the browser does not support css animations / transitions, just like the page transitions degrade if needed.

Great ideas all around. I think adding a full set of icons to the section on theming will add soem nice emphasis (http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-themes.html) and adding a link to this from the basics page as @agcolom suggests is also a good idea. Tweaking the language on the 3 buttons on the basics page to say ""custom icons"" or ""16x16 icons"" vs. ""standard icons"" will help distinguish these. I think that's the only place where there would be confusion between these types of icons but if you all see another place where this is confusing, let's use consistent language.

This will be low priority since we don't officially support this method of loading jqm. I believe what we've done in the past is to create a meta module where jquery is the initial load dependency, your init methods are in a callback with require of the rest of jqm. Something like:

My app doesn't use scrolling directly on pages, I just have ""-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch"" on content boxes within the pages. To stop any scrolling problems JQM might cause, I have this code added ""window.scrollTo = function(){};""

I will give the scrolling a look in a bit with some simple test cases, not my app, to see if I can help you. But if you can't find a solution and I can't either, maybe you might want to do something similar to what I'm doing with the indirect scrolling, you'll have to write your own technique to remember the scrollHeights unfortunately if you need them to be persistent
",xibxor,dcarrith
4129,2012-04-22 04:25:30,"@dcarrith I took a look and though it is very nice, I feel that the long scrolls are not user-friendly at all. The optimal solution would be to have the page scrolled before the user even sees it, would you not agree? With this in mind, I set up a page on my server to figure this issue out and came up with a temporary fix. Maybe with your help, we can come up with a real patch.

Test case is here: http://scrollto.com/test.html

There are 2 pages which look like documentation pages, try any transition and then use the back/forward button of your browser to see the scrolling in action. You shouldn't actually see any scrolling because it happens before the page transition.

This is the code for the fix:



In my past experiences with building web apps, changing height of elements will not allow the browser to immediately scroll to that height. To circumvent this, I have overridden the scrollTo calls to first adjust the body height THEN scroll on the next frame of JS execution, after CSS changes have taken effect. Without the timeout, the scrollTo will be effectiveless.

I see this comment in the jQuery Mobile Code:   



Seems like the devs have it a bit wrong, it's not the 3D transformation blocking the scrollTo. It's that most browsers, webkit namely, are not allowing a scrollTo immediately after height change, setTimeout(func, 0) needs to be used to get around this limitation.

4129,2012-04-22 06:27:43,"@dcarrith I've had the domain for a while, yeah :)

I totally agree, transparent > smooth > jumpy

Just made some changes to test.html to make it easier to see the difference between page1 and page2. 

For me, the scrolling is working fine, however there is a problem with some of the transitions flickering (youll see blue/red)

Maybe you are confusing the animation flickering with the scroll jumping, I believe it's fixed at the test.html page I've linked.

If not, what environment are you using to test? I'm using Chrome.

I looked into the first problem, too. Here is a [sample page](http://franckreich.de/jqm/sample.html).

This is what's happening, if you have a link like this:


- Inside _resetUIkeys_ function JQM is adding the _#-hashtag_ to dialogs and subkeys. Ok.
- But if a href like above is passed, the function receives _pagetwo_, doesn't add the hashtag and returns _pagetwo_
- In _hashValueAfterReset_,  _$.mobile.path.parseUrl( pagetwo )_ populates object falsely because of missing _#_
- _$.mobile.path.parseUrl( pagetwo )_.**hash** will be an empty string passed back as _toHash_ and _fromHash_
- Inside _onPopState_, _toHash_ and _fromHash_ always equal (both empty strings)
- Thus **hashChanged** is comparing two empty strings and always returns true(?) - I'm confused as to why...

I have consoled this into the sample page. Goto page 2 > Goto page 3 > go back and check the console.

I guess to solve _resetUIkeys_ would have to add a #-hashtag to links like ""pagetwo"" as well.

I've tested the samePage transition on Safari (iOS/Win) and FF (Win) and it seems, just the slide-transition raises this issue.
After change page with slide, the page container keeps the display:none styling because it misses the ui-page-active class.

A workaround like:`
$('#page').bind('pageshow', function(e) {

@toddparker Could it be you missed that I was talking about multiple selects, not custom select menus in general?

The multiple select menu can be opened with enter, but arrow keys only scroll the window. The issue is that the menu (modal or dialog) does not get focus when opened. Focus is still on the button.

The issue with tab goes for all type of custom select menus (modal or dialog).
If you hit tab (by accident or because you think it can be used to walk true option list) you can't get the focus back on the option list and the up/down arrow key get their scrolling functionality. If there is a close/back button in the header you can 'tab' to it and close the menu.
Biggest problem is when the menu doesn't have a close button. In that case there is no way to close the menu anymore with keyboard after the tab key has been pressed.
The behaviour of the tab key is expected because it skips to next link and the options in the list are not links. Maybe it is possible to realize that the up/down arrow key bring back focus to the option list. In general I think it would be a good idea when the escape key gets a 'close menu' functionality.

4024,2012-05-03 05:08:52,"@toddparker Every transition feels broken, more than the transition smoothness, its the jumping in longer pages. Even data-transition=""none"" is jumpy :(
",3drockz,toddparker
4024,2012-05-03 22:14:27,"@dcarrith I agree... the fixed header/footers are one of the biggest issues.

I also figured that the major jump is caused when you've scrolled to the middle of a page and trigger a transition and figured that the jump is caused when JQM tries to scroll top and trigger the transition. So I explicitly set it in jQuery to auto scroll to top on every link click. 

This fixes 99% of the issue and you no more see the page jumping (the 1% is just a minor flicker in the sticky header which I'm still trying to figure out).

$('a').click(function () {
    $('html, body, .ui-page').animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, 0);
});

This works best either when data-transition is set to either none or fade. Hope this helps someone with this issue.

I'm still curious on the 1% on why the headers kinda still flicker when the page loads... this happens on every page load (but this wont happen when you have a multi-page template in the same HTML)

When you look at the app in the phone, its so easy for someone to look at your app's flicker/transition behavior and say it is Cordova/HTML5!

Before considering adding a new container, did we confirm that `body { width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; }` doesn't fix this in a similar way?

If so...

Are we proposing here that the framework should add another container, dynamically, as a child of the `body` all the time? Or should it only do so in phonegap/offline scenarios? Or should we recommend that people building for android in phonegap follow the steps outlined in the article above?

I'm concerned that wrapping our pages in a generated container goes in the opposite direction we are currently headed, in that it imposes another JS manipulation step to the entire dom before the page can be shown, properly styled. But we also don't want to add static boilerplate markup to our requirements, as the example showed.

Did we consider the possibility of offering an optional plugin for phonegap scenarios that will generate this wrapper div and set the `$.mobile.pageContainer` to reference it, but not do this by default all the time?

<p>I'm not sure I like your fix. The 1.0 code attempted to squash the hashchange event that might occur at the time of the popstate event. The 1.1 code attempted to prevent the hashchange event in cases where no hashchange was expected, but allowed it to occur otherwise. Your code simply assumes a hashchange event is going to occur, and cancels the second event should it occur within a particular time frame. After a lot of thought, I've come up with the following ideas on how to solve this once and for all:</p>


<ol>
<li>Implement two different page tracking systems:
<ol>
    <li>stateTracking
        <ul>
             <li>uses history.pushState and the window.popstate event for tracking pages</li>
             <li>produces pretty urls, and includes an option not to make any url changes</li>
             <li>does not make use of the hashchange event</li>
             <li>if pageState isn't supported, simply fall back to the hashTracking method</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>hashTracking
         <ul>
             <li>heavily reliant upon the hashchange event</li>
             <li>same basic implementation that occurs when pageStateEnabled is currently set to false</li>
         </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

</li>
<li>Try to fix existing method via a new virtual hashchange event, vhashchange. A single handler for the current hashchange event would be implemented which would ignore any browser issued hashchange events that shouldn't have occurred. I've played around with this a bit, but have yet to make it work properly. Existing code could simply bind to the vhashchange event rather than the hashchange event.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these options, I think the first is well worth pursing. Not only would it solve the issue, but it will also make page changes happen quicker and more seamlessly. IE, when using 1.1 with pageState enabled in Firefox, the jump in the address bar due to changing the hash and then replacing the state is very noticeable. This option would eliminate that initial hash change and result in a much smoother page transition. As far as backwards compatibility is concerned, none of the current api would change. $.mobile.pageStateEnabled could still be used to force the use of hashTracking over stateTracking. Internally however, there are a lot of areas that will need to be changed to make this happen.</p>

3880,2012-04-03 11:29:41,"hey @gseguin 

Interesting, I just tested and found that this problem does not occur in jQuery UI widgets. This means either our widget factory version is missing the required fix, or our extension of the widget factory is messing things up.

In fact, destroyed widgets in jQuery UI return undefined when you try and get the element's `$(selector).data(""widgetnamehere"")`, whereas for us, we get the full widget instance.

I'm thinking we're in need of an upgrade, but it's probably not wise to do so for 1.1. Do you agree?

Since this isn't just an issue with fixedtoolbars, but all our widgets, I'm not sure where it's affecting people, or where we'd even attempt to prevent it. If it's already affecting people, they'll probably need to adjust their code because the widget factory update will only bring them into an exception.

For example, currently the method applies in places it shouldn't, but after the upgrade, it'll probably throw the ""cannot call methods on xyz prior to initialization"" error.

The way around it would be to select the element by its widget class before doing anything with it:



So, should we close this out and add a generic ticket for upgrading our widget version?
",scottjehl,gseguin
3880,2012-11-11 11:52:52,"@scottjehl @gseguin

Unless i missed something which is certainly possible it looks like we can close this one out.

There is still a problem here though i think its a separate issue. as @scottjehl mentions above calling any method after destroy should throw an error  ""cannot call methods on xyz prior to initialization"" This is not happening with the fixed toolbar widget. however if you look at http://jsbin.com/uzaret/501/edit with list view the error is thrown as expected.

3803,2013-04-26 17:48:40,"This is really unfortunate behavior--the problem for me is not that it's occurring, per se, but that it propagates to other elements and there's no way to stop it because it's a completely different event trigger.  For instance, I'm using a swipeleft event to swipe a view, but when done over another UI element (a contact selection field in this case), the tap registers on the field as well as the swipe on the element below.  The only thing I can think to do is provide a virtual interface above it to allow/stop propagation to below elements, which is complicated and unnecessary.

@arschmitz waiting to determine if it's a taphold is no different than the way that touch determines tap vs. click.  If the touchstart and touchend events occur in less than the tap threshold, then you're not delaying the tap, nor disabling te taphold functionality.  In fact, the tap event isn't even fired until you let go and it triggers both the taphold and tap events, so I don't think the delay wouldn't be a problem.

I propose that swipe, swipeleft, swiperight, and taphold all do not trigger a tap when executed.

To change that width, you’ll want to add `div.ui-slider-switch { width: 9em }` to your stylesheet, as outlined in Todd’s link above, and you’ll need to do so according to the width of the labels you’re using. 

@agcolom : No worries—I’m changing the default width to be slightly larger, and I’m adding a heading to the docs calling out the details on changing that width. I’ll add a blurb about making it smaller, as well. Thanks!

The follow are steps of reproducing this issue:
1. create an adroid/phonegap project (you can use eclipse);
2. replace the index.html to the attached one (see attached source code);
3. run the application directly in Galaxy Nexus (it will be automatically deployed);
4. After see the page (portrait), change the orientation to landscape ( do not touch the screen).

You will see the fixed tool bar only shows the portrait's length. Only after you touch the screen, it will be extended to landscape length.

This is a browser bug. IE treats that second click on the mouse wheel as a left mouse click (which would stop the mouse movement scrolling as well).
If you go to a non JQM website and you click a second time on the mouse wheel while the pointer is on a link, that link will be activated.

Hey Scott,

Is there any other way we can try to prevent the location bar from dropping? IMO we shouldn't be outright changing hrefs for links for exactly the reason this bug is about ... we don't know what developers are going to be doing in the events/notifications triggered by the framework processing of the link.
",jblas,gseguin
3686,2012-03-09 17:41:44,"I'm unsure there is.

Before implementing this, I did several isolated tests and found that changing the href to a hash-based value was the only way to prevent it, short of handling touch events that is.

I agree though, what we're doing here is not ideal, and potentially problematic for developers. Not sure what to recommend, since the virtual/touch events can't be trusted entirely for navigation...

3677,2012-02-29 17:06:40,"I've tracked down the problematic button.  I'm not sure why it's causing a
problem though.  Other than the href being the last attribute in the a
element, I don't see anything out of the ordinary.  FYI, I'm using a
CodeIgniter function to create the anchor.

Here's the CodeIgniter code:

<?php $content_span = '<span class=""ui-btn-inner ui-btn-corner-all""><span
class=""ui-btn-text"">'.$cancel_i18n.'</span></span>'; ?>

<?php echo anchor('', $content_span, array('data-role'=>'button',
'data-rel'=>'back', 'data-direction'=>'reverse', 'class'=>'ui-btn
ui-btn-corner-all ui-shadow ui-btn-up-'.$theme_buttons,
'data-theme'=>$theme_buttons)); ?>

By passing in '' for the anchor, CodeIgniter uses whatever site_url is
defined in the config file (as seen below in the rendered markup).

Here's the markup that gets rendered if I go directly to the page:

<a data-theme=""a"" class=""ui-btn ui-btn-corner-all ui-shadow ui-btn-up-a""
data-direction=""reverse"" data-rel=""back"" data-role=""button"" href=""
http://www.mydomain.com/""><span class=""ui-btn-inner
ui-btn-corner-all""><span class=""ui-btn-text"">Cancel</span></span></a>

I'll keep trying to track down what's causing the issue.

The scenario this addresses is the following: pagecreate will be triggered first, causing presumably all widgets to perform their enhancement synchronously in response to the event in whatever order the async script loading has caused their pagecreate handlers to become attached. Thereafter, pageinit is indeed emitted synchronously after pagecreate, but because it's a separate event, only the pageinit handlers will be called in whatever order the async script loading has caused their pageinit handlers to become attached. Thus there is no chance that those that wish to access the final DOM structure end up mixed in with the rest of the pagecreate handlers because of async script loading.

I suppose <widget>init has become an API since we have published it in at least one version, so restricting the event to page would be too late. However, triggering it from _init() is quite doable, and should remove the override.

3558,2012-02-28 14:11:02,"Hi @toddparker, @Wilto,

I have some additional idea how to disable link button in IE. We can render link buttons in ‘buttons’ plugin instead of ‘buttonmarkup’ plugin. In this case we can use disable() and enable() functions for link buttons the same way as for general buttons. All we need is to add [data-role=’button’] to ‘buttons’ plugin initSelector and remove ‘:jqmData(role='button')’ from ‘buttonmarkup’ plugin initSelectior. It works for IE8/9. In this case we will have 'disabled' attribute and also 'ui-disabled' css class. 'disabled'  attribute will make the trick to make link unclickable for IE8/9. Unfortunately I found out that this approach doesn’t work for IE7 because it ignores ‘disabled’ attribute and link stays clickable. As a possible workaround we can temporary rename ‘href’ attribute in disabled() func to ‘hrefTemp’ and set it again in enable() func.
",sgrebnov,toddparker
3558,2012-02-28 23:01:41,"@sgrebnov Oh, I think we’re mostly squared-up on this now, including IE. The only thing we have left to do for the sake of browsers that don’t support the CSS <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/pointer-events"">pointer events</a> property is call `preventDefault()` (possibly `return false`) on link-based buttons that have the `ui-disabled` class attached.
",Wilto,sgrebnov
3558,2012-02-29 06:48:23,"@Wilto I see now, suppose we only need to add small change to buttonMarkup.js to handle click event specially for element with 'ui-disabled' class (preventing the call). I can add this change if you want (and if my understanding is correct)

So in reviewing your commit I noticed that we make two calls to `$.mobile.focusPage` for some reason. One in the `doneOut` callback in the transitions module and another in the navigation module in the promise resolution callback. Right near the second call I noticed a comment referencing issue [here](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1088). It appears I already fixed this issue before the transitions module was created ([fix](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/15f1c6de663e4babfd5a1c3d50161571b08cff56)) and all we really needed to do was remove the call in the `doneOut` callback.

I think this just transplanted the issue that jQuery had up into our code. The problem with swallowing the exception is that it's the same as not calling focus at all in IE. If we remove the focus call altogether then it doesn't much matter but if the focus call is important then we need to move the focus call to the point at which the element is visible.

@toddparker 

Can you comment on how important that focus is? (We focus the title on page load I believe)

Setting the padding based on toolbar height is trivial, but I'm a little hesitant of constantly updating it on resize, since this may not affect the average jQM user (only those with taller toolbars). We already do a lot of that sort of thing on resize, and pageshow.

Questions:
- Should this behavior happen automatically, or would a public method that you could call when your app needs it be sufficient?
- If we set it up to update the padding automatically, should that behavior be optional? Do we default to on or off?

If I understand you right that pull request @toddparker is refering to is not related. That only concerns regular links in bars.

You are talking about anchor elements that are styled as buttons. In case you add a rule for a:visited this will apply to all buttons because a:visited has a higer level of specificity than .ui-btn-up-c.

To prevent this from happening a rule has to be added for the visited pseudo class for each theme/swatch, for each button state (up/hover/down). In case H5BP CSS has rules for a:hover and a:active two more rules has to be added to each theme for the hover and down state.

These do sound potentially useful, but they sound to me like a jQuery core request rather than one for jQM, and probably more of a plugin, rather than a standard core feature at that. 

As an aside, I think formbeforesubmit sounds like the standard ""submit"" event, rather than a new one. You can bind to submit and prevent default to do what you're explaining, I think at least.

I'd suggest moving this event request to jQuery core's issues for discussion there. @jblas, do you agree?

After this you will still see something in the upper left corner of the button on that demo page but that's because no image src has been set in the markup.

Here is a test page: http://jsbin.com/osoxan/3/

Besides the input type=""image"" button, I don't see any difference between JQM styled buttons after changing the -webkit-appearance property from ""button"" to ""none"". I tested Android Gingerbread + ICS, Safari/Win, Chrome/Win. I don't have iOS5 at the moment, maybe you can test that.

Update: I forgot to mention that I also tested -moz-appearance ""none"" and didn't see any difference either on FF or Fennec emulator. The problem with JQM enhanced input type=""image"" based buttons doesn't occur on those browsers anyway.

I'm curious if you tried either of the two suggestions in the SO comments?
1. Disabling automatic page initialization
2. Wrapping your plugin definition in a function that's bound to `mobileinit`

I'm going to address the ticket, if neither of them work please open a separate ticket/feature request.
",johnbender,frequent
3415,2012-08-14 21:34:27,"@johnbender 

Some time ago. 

I'm currently using the below, which more or less incorporates both suggestions from SO. I'm using both in order to mesh JQM with requireJS and my plugin.

(in order of being called)

overrides.js



app.js => app controller



multiview.js 



My problem was that JQM triggered on mobileinit and inits the first page before requireJS pulled in multiview (on docready) and set my `mainEventbindings`. Therefore multiview missed the inital page events triggering. 

I'm still using my hack from above - see [here](http://www.stokkers.de/test2012/members/login.cfm#/test2012/members/contact.cfm) for example (breaking controlgroups along the way ... [4773](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4773)). 

The above deeplink is handled by JQM ( 2nd option in initializepage - $window.trigger( ""hashchange"", [ true ] ); ) loading login and then contact (probably not the way it should be), while a panel deeplink (for example [here](http://www.stokkers.de/test2012/members/contact.cfm#languages)) ) will be handled by my hack, which has JQM load the first page (contact) and then trigger a pagechange to load the deeplinked page (languages).

I initailly posted on this issue, because I was looking for a way to re-direct panel deeplinks since without the hack, JQM will break trying to load the 2nd link. Looking at this now (after a while), I should be able to bind to `pagecontainercreate` from within my mainEventbindings and then re-direct accordingly if I still need to. 

So I'm more or less a happy camper. 

I would still be happy to see `pagecontainercreate` triggering on the `body` vs `window` though.

I'll mostly defer to @gseguin on this, but your interest is greatly appreciated given your obvious familiarity with the subject matter!

Our primary goal, before even beginning with AMD, was to create a download builder so that people could slim down the library where possible. We obviously needed to determine dependencies and using AMD to do that resolution was a clear win over doing something custom (note: the deps themselves are still a work in process). The use of it in the docs and tests is just a happy coincidence that lets devs discard php while working on the library. 

The decision to use pragmas came after attempting to using sed in our build process which turned out to be clunky. We also wanted any reference to AMD to be discarded in our builds since we aren't really using it to define modules, just for dependencies. 

All that said, we are considering leveraging AMD in a more traditional manner (which I'm relatively ignorant of) by doing things  like you've mentioned and possible defining module exports.

Hopefully that gives you some insight into our motivation and why our AMD implementation looks rather stunted :D
",johnbender,jrburke
3386,2012-01-05 20:58:22,"@jrburke 

I should also note that we don't support loading the library async in production as yet but people are encouraged to try it out to make sure our dependencies are in good shape. 
",johnbender,jrburke
3386,2012-01-05 21:43:21,"@johnbender that makes sense, I know of some libraries that just use AMD-style internally for this kind of thing and do not use it once the file is built. That is a great use for it, and I think what I mentioned above would fit that style and reduce some line noise in the source. But I'll wait for @gseguin to comment on it. If you all are happy with what you have implemented that is great too.

To add to what @johnbender just said, one of the goal was also to make sure we end up in the same state after the transition to AMD. That's why we just wrapped the existing code with the define block. We're totally open to improvements

I've experimented with processing the file post build to remove the define statements, it was pretty disastrous in terms of code maintenance and reliability. 

Maybe a combo of what you're proposing and the pragmas could be a better solution than the current one.

I think this bug could be the source of another problem I have on the same platform but I haven't had time to test it properly and build a small example that could reproduce it. I have a list of items in my app. Each of this items can be clicked. Also a long click (tap) on this item produces a popup menu which partially covers some items of that list. So when I click on the menu the click gets handled by the popup menu handler but the handler also closes the popup. What happens then is that the list item directly underneath the popup receives a click event (and handles it of course). I can not tell what is the source of the second event and I suspect it might be this issue. But that's a story for another bug report. Thank you again for your time.

I think we should leave the list management up to the user (hopefully a kvo library) and just rest on `refresh` as our update api. I think Knockout can do the management because it controls the js object representation of the DOM view on which it can do diffs, see [compareArrays.js](https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout/blob/master/src/binding/editDetection/compareArrays.js). I could be wrong on that score though.

In this case I think we'd trigger `listviewafterrefresh` at the end of the refresh method in `$.mobile.listview` and the your plugin could bind to it and ""sort things out"". Using the widget factory trigger for prefix/consistency:



Hopefully that will help with the `DOM*` events. We just aren't in the business of managing state after the initial enhance, it's up to the user.

Regarding your 20x speed-up ... you can get it even faster if you do 2 things:
- Don't use each() and instead manually loop through the collection with something like a for(){} loop. This avoids the function-call per-list-item penalty that each() imposes.
- Don't use the jQuery markup shortcuts to create elements, and instead use DOM methods, document.createElement() and element.setAttribute(), and element.insertBefore().

Thanks for these pointers. I've rewritten the code slightly to use
this approach (though on the 400 element list it makes negligible
difference, but I guess it could matter more on mobile devices).

Yah, go ahead and drop that trigger at the bottom of the refresh. 

> Are we agreed that the autosort functionality suggested by jblas should go into a separate extension and can be left out of autodividers?

Yes, or we can add it here later. Either way I want to get this merged in, we've dithered enough on all this hard work you've done.

> Are you happy with the implementation of the ""selector as function""?

I'm still of the opinion we should avoid supporting ""words-as-functionality"" in the same way we avoided it with the listview filter. I'd rather just provide a callback that's defined on the options where the default is the alpha check. Also, that way we can remove the ""type"" information because it will always just be a callback. The fact that it requires code change to alter the behavior is entirely acceptable. 

> Is it OK that it's not possible to reset options on this extension after it has been applied (because it's not a fully-fledged widget)? If that's not OK, what is the correct pattern to fix that?

I was going to do a quick refactor and move this off the global `$.fn` namespace and onto the listview prototype so the options can be altered at runtime there. The idea being that the invocation can be`$(""#my-list"").listview('autodivide')`, but the functionality can remain an external plugin that's removable from the build where it isn't necessary. If that idea bothers you as the original author please do let us know. Either way, we can handle making the options flexible.

[UPDATE] I didn't take a huge amount of time to understand the selector functionality so feel free to correct any assumptions I've made with the above.

Thanks for reviewing and merging, I'm really pleased.

I'm sorry, I can't make discussions this Thursday, as I'm already
pledged elsewhere.

On the HTMLElement being passed in: that provides the most flexibility
in choosing how the selector works, as you can access any of its
internal elements or their properties (obviously). The previous
approach was to just specify a selector instead, but a prior comment
on the pull request suggested the option should be set by supplying a
full function.

The advantage of a selector is it can be declarative (you could even
supply it via data-\* attribute), but obviously it's a bit more ugly
and maybe more cryptic.

I leave it to your judgement as to what the best way to go is.

Thanks again.

Q1

I agree it would be nice to have a `data-*` attribute for the option but putting it on the link itself seems odd in the same way that designating the page loaded should be a dialog is odd. In the case of `data-rel=dialog` the convenience is such a massive win that any weirdness and difficulty in implementation is forgotten. Otherwise we might end up with a bunch of dialog specific data attributes on the link. 

I think we should make it a page/dialog data attribute option. The only people we're pleasing by putting the data attribute on the link is the intersection of the set of people who don't know whether the linked page should be a dialog or a page at design time and the set of people who want to alter the default bottom corner behavior (small set of folks imo).

@toddparker can/should this be off by default?

Q2

The data attributes should be available in the `this.options` object in the dialog widget. If we go the above route that should be a non-issue.

3290,2011-12-21 20:38:44,"Regarding #1, some browsers don't clip the content inside of an element to it's border-radius, so if content inside a rounded element specifies a background, the corners of the content render over the rounded corners of the element. I believe this is why things like the custom-select pop-up (used when items fit completely within the viewport) use padding on the element to make sure the rounded corners show. In this particular case, the .ui-content container that is the parent of the listview specifies a 15px padding all around, but the non-inset listview by default specifies a -15px margin which basically negates the .ui-content's padding. We need to consult @toddparker, @wilto, and/or @scottjehl as to what the proper thing to do here is? Live with it? Add padding? I noticed that a listview inside custom-select dialog actually gets a unique class placed on it ui-selectmenu-list, but didn't see any rules defined for it.

Regarding #2, it would be nice if we could figure out what exactly is causing the slow down, and what contributes to it? Is it the number of items in the list? Is it  a specific style that's in use? What are you using as your test case for this? When you mention scroll lag, are you talking about when your finger is down and you are dragging things around? Or is it after you drag and lift your finger to scroll with momentum? I ask because I'm wondering if the lag is due to a redraw of the hover/down state on the list item you touched to initiate the drag?

Regarding #a, I think this should be done regardless. We don't want to introduce interdependencies between or knowledge of other components if we can help it.

Regarding #b, not sure what you meant by a ""different place"", but if there is another way to apply it that doesn't introduce this lag I'd be willing to hear about it.

Regarding #c, we don't want to do this. The rounded corners are a property of an ancestor of the listview so we don't want the listview dictating to it's ancestor containers/components how they should be styled.

Regarding #d we should do this if there is no solution/workaround. I also see this related to #1 ... if in the custom-select dialog case we see square buttons everywhere except WP7 and FF, then maybe we should disable it for all custom-select dialogs ... this is where the option in #a comes into play. It would be passed to the dialog() constructor in the custom-select code.

Regarding #e, yes it would be nice to know the ""why"" for listviews. Once again, is it because of the number of elements involved? Or is it because of some style that is used on _EVERY_ listitem?

But facing your reply I decided not to park the querystring in the page hash but in the url as ""real"" query parameters, and then not to use a multipage approach but single webpages containing one page. This works fine now, after struggling with the DOM cache, as it takes not only the webpage-name but includes the query parameters as lookup-key, too. This leads to multiple DOM insertions when re-navigating the page (with just different querystring values) and breaks the DOM due to the then ambigious page-id.

I worked around this, but I think I'll make a feature request regarding this scenario.

Actually I would prefer to have an ajax on because the page looks better and when ajax is off I have another issue much more serious - in IE the button does not work properly. I have to click on the upper part of the button in order to work. Submit buttons does not work too when ajax is off. So this is much worse. In version 1,0 jQuery Mobile added (I believe in 1.0) for IE to see a links underscoring the button text which makes IE buttons to work because they are actually a link. Submit works too (I don't know why but it does). This is good enough to me.

So I will go with the ajax on definitely. Only this browser bar address URL's and hashes are causing me troubles. 
I will post the full layout.html I am using so if you please look at it and tell me what is wrong. I tested the same page 
with a template working without jQuery Mobile - onl jQuery and it works properly. But I like to use the same design for mobile to be used in desktop too. Actually it looks better on desktop no matter it is designed for mobile.

> @gabrielschulhof - That is a cool demo. Curious how much overhead that adds for collision detection vs. just popping up over the thing like the simple popup. Do you have a sense?

It's actually pretty simple. The existing code that decides where to put the popup is repeated once for a location above the desired coordinates, and once for a location below. Then, the coordinates which are closest to those desired are chosen for the popup.

> In order for this to look polished, we'd need to set the arrow color to match the gradient color because it doesn't line up so that will add some complexity unless popups just use the flat bg color.

I'm not sure what we can do here, because the arrow is currently nothing but the bottom (resp. top) border of a 0-sized div whose left and right borders are transparent and whose border width is actually the height of the triangle. [Here's](http://www.infimum.dk/HTML/slantinfo.html) where I got the idea from. AFAIK borders cannot be gradients. OTOH, I recall one of the demos you added to the documentation was that of an image with a (X) in the top left corner sticking out of the body of the popup. We might do the same thing to get the arrow looking right.

When testing http://jquerymobile.com/branches/css-fixed/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html on FF 8.0.1 (Mac OS) and Safari 5.1.1

All works fine, but there is a minor bug:
Scroll down a bit so that you still have some of the ""secondary display"" menu on the left handside, and so that the header bar is over the menu. click the window to toggle the fixed bars. The header and footer bars disappear from the screen. Scroll to the top of the screen (the header bar is right at the top as expected). Now, click the window again to toggle the fixed bars. Slowly scroll down. You'll see that the secondary display (left hand0side menu) goes over the header bar, and the form elements also go over the bar. 

Problem: It seems that the toggle in this case gives the header bar the fade.out class (and the z-index of 0 associated), and loses its z-index of 1000.

3216,2012-02-06 04:45:33,"Okay, folks, I think we're probably in as good of shape as we're going to get with this one. Support is looking great on a boatload of devices, and falls back respectably in most others we've tested.

My latest commit allows for toggling in Android while ensuring fixed toolbars still stay fixed at pageload, on most Android 2.3 devices, such as the emulator, and I'm assuming many other popular devices.

@toddparker with your testing confirmation, I'd like to declare this one ready. Here's some additional detail of what I found today:

There are some edge cases to fixed support, even within OSs that are supposed to work: I've found at least 2 stock Android 2.3 devices (HTC devices with Sense UI, and Samsung Galaxy Mini) have webkit ports that do not allow user scaling to be disabled at all through any apparent means. While this is generally a good thing for users, it means position: fixed doesn't work in those places either, since zoom must be disabled on 2.3 for that to work. In these platforms, you'll get scrollbars that scroll with the page content and reposition after scroll. Opting them out of fixed will mean slicing our UA detection even further to target specific carrier implementations of 2.3... the need for a solid feature test is getting even more important!

I found that you can actually get position:fixed to work on 2.3 without disabling user scaling if you apply a 3D transform to the fixed elements. However, that transform prevents the elements from being toggled to other positioning models, like absolute, which is a feature we need for supporting our toggling. Not helpful for us, but maybe for others. Here's a sample page with zoom enabled that works on 2.3: http://jsbin.com/izakek

In the commit above, I noticed that zoom wasn't properly being disabled on common Android 2.3 devices with our $.mobile.zoom utility, and adding user-scalable=no to our existing maximum-scale=1 disabling value seemed to fix that without disabling zoom for good on iOS...

Anyway, it's clear that there are some implementations out there that this may cause some issues in. We'll have to watch it closely, and if anyone has ideas for a new approach to feature testing fixed (that doesn't introduce false results on some platforms), we are so interested :)

3207,2012-03-23 00:01:30,"@agcolom I can't confirm the fix as i'm no longer working on the project that used jqm. But with all the good efforts i've seen that went into jqm 1.1 i'll hopefully be using it again soon.

It would also be really nice if jqm could get the js to the bottom of the page, and do most of it's fancy ui tricks in a more bootastrap css style of way (modularized). Right now the choice between jq+m, jquery+bootstrap, or jquery+handcoded is pretty hard when doing multi-lingual, multi-domain, multi-navigator dynamic white label websites. But i'm sure that in the next 1 to 2 years to come, all these progressing technologies will kick some serious butt out of native clients :)

Pretty sure jq.UI 2.0 or 2.1 will have something to say about this too ^^

btw, i think themeroller is a great way to go, especially the bookmarklet version (think interactive cms styling). Another great project, but which i think is dead, yet think the idea deserves to go the way of themeroller is:

John,
I agree that the ""pageinit"" event is documented..  My point is that the documentation references a pageInit() function and implies that it should be invoked.   Nearly the first thing on the page is ""Important: Use pageInit()"".  As nearly as I can tell that function does not exist (at the user level).  While the text describes binding to the ""pageinit"" event, the mention of a pageInit() function is fairly confusing.

3190,2011-11-30 03:15:08,"@eddiemonge We have a situation where the user starts on page A, chooses a value from a dropdown and submits the form to page B.  Page B can redirect to C1, C2, or C3 depending on a value derived from the choice made on page A.

(At the time A loads, we don't know which choices will lead to C1 vs C2 vs C3, so we have to hit B to decide at the moment the user submits the form.)

Since there is no reason to show B to the user, we want to redirect as quick as possible.  It's weird, I know.

On Webkit browsers, if a user got to C1 and clicked a link to C1a, then clicked Back, the user would be taken to page B instead of C1 because the history stack was missing a page.  We used the setTimeout workaround.

Short version:
Start at **A** submit form to **B** redirect to **C1** click link to **C1a**... Back button goes to **B**.

So I stopped to think about making this alteration to the various `$.fn` plugins. In the same way it doesn't  make sense (to me at least) to just exclude elements from widget enhancement implicitly by adding logic to our `_createWidget` decoration, it doesn't make sense for someone to call `$(""foo"").controlgroup()` and only have some of the elements enhance without an obvious reason why.

Instead I've added `$.fn.jqmEnhanceable` (open to naming suggestions) as a collection pruning method so that wherever these fluent helpers are called it will be obvious where to look for the exclusion logic. 



I'm going under the assumption that I should add these to all the callsites of all the plugins internally because these data-enhance false containers could live inside widget markup that might contain something that requires `buttonMarkup`.

3153,2012-02-21 20:13:53,"@jblas 

Two questions.

Is the following too clever and/or not cool because we don't prevent the original binding?



Where `selector` is ""form"" for forms and nothing for links (they are handled at the document level) and each of our bindings checks for the `mobile.ignore` property and returns early.

Are we namespacing event object property additions? If we aren't it might be a good idea to start doing that. From the above:

",johnbender,jblas
3153,2012-02-22 02:23:24,"@johnbender 

If I'm not mistaken, the proposed solution is a bit more expensive than simply calling a function, from our ajax click/form handlers, which traverses manually up the ancestry hierarchy from the link/form looking for said attribute.

The reasons I say this is because:
- placing a click/vclick/submit handler at the document level, as in the patch, will cause that code to evaluate the selector against _EVERY_ click/vclick/submit that is generated within the document. This will be done in addition to the evaluation that is already done to determine if it is a form/link we should handle.
- Using sizzle to evaluate whether a given node or its ancestors satisfy a selector is often slower than just using ele.parentNode and checking to see if that attr/value exists.

Also adding:



means that _EVERY_ jQuery Event object will share the same mobile instance object, which means once event.mobile.ignore is set to true, it will always be true for all events because we never set it back to false.

",johnbender,lukeb
3149,2011-12-12 23:34:40,"@frequent

Each UI component in the framework is self-contained. The way they hook into the enhancement mechanism is by binding to the pagecreate event at the document level. This means that anytime an instance of a page component is _CREATED_, each component handler will get invoked. These handlers usually search for elements (by tag name, by selector) underneath the page element that is the target of the ""pagecreate"" event.

Pages within the framework are created by invoking $.fn.page() on a jquery collection that contains a page element. Because the Page component is implemented as a UI widget, you can really only call $.fn.page() on a given element once. Subsequent calls to $.fn.page() as a constructor are ignored since an underlying page object already exists for that element. This means the ""pagecreate"" event is only fired once _EVER_ for a given page element.

This is why @scottjehl added support for a generic ""create"" event. The intent was that the ""create"" event could be triggered by developers, for a page that was _ALREADY_ created, to wake up the UI components to search for newly added markup, within the target page, they should enhance.

Most components, excluding the page component, listen for ""create"" events.

That all said, if you inject page markup into the DOM and then navigate to it, the new page should be enhanced automatically for you. Is this not the case?
",jblas,frequent
3149,2011-12-13 00:04:32,"@jblas  

thanks for the detailed explanation. I looked up my code in question again. I had hoped for an automatic-enhancement as you described, but when setting up my plugin, the default pages (_jqmData(data-show=""first"")_) on every panel did not enhance. I guess this is because the panels containing these pages are wrapped in a JQM-page, which did get enhanced, so subsequent pagecreate events don't fire for a seemingly reason. 

I tried&errored my way to this:



which works.

I had hoped to get by without calling page(), because it seemed to mess up other parts of the plugin, but once I could make sure, the above only fired once, everything was ok. 

So I guess I can close. Thx again. 
",frequent,jblas
3149,2011-12-13 07:49:14,"@jblas 

Correct. (wrapper-)page contains panels contains nested pages. I was trying to figure out how to enhance the first page on each panel. Subsequent nested pages are working fine.

I'm trying to do support both pages on board during creating/init of the wrapper page (I'm labelling with _data-internal-page=""true""_) as well as pages that are injected afterwards. So far this seems to work ok.

And so we come full-circle, almost all the way back to what the original implementation used, which used $.fn.hasClass() which basically does a string indexOf() under the hood which this pull request is proposing.

The one thing we were trying to do with hasClass() was make sure we didn't get any false positives since some of the button hierarchies built up use classes like ui-btn, ui-btn-inner, ui-btn-text, etc.

It would be interesting to weigh the original hasClass() against the current 2 in the jsperf above.

The second check looks for starting "".."" and also has to end in /:

3068,2011-11-16 22:16:49,"@parakhm @toddparker

So I was able to reproduce the problem with a static markup snapshot of the selects page mentioned above with the states select-menu showing. I can remove all jQuery Mobile js and add a really simple click handler that just places the pop class on both the select menu and the main page, and I see the same blinking.

To be clear, the select menu is _NOT_ being re-opened by jQuery Mobile, the browser itself is re-displaying the transition ""from"" element upon completion of the animation, and then corrects itself on the next re-flow and paint.

The problem seems to be related to the size/complexity of the elements (pages) being animated and the duration of the animation. For example, if I adjusted the animation duration from the default 350msecs, in the CSS, to 1sec, the browser does not show the ""from"" element at the end of the animation. Alternatively, if I adjust the size of the ""to"" page and/or the from ""page"", by commenting out content so that they are shorter, the problem also goes away.

Folks always recommend making use of -webkit-backface-visibility:hidden, but that doesn't work in this specific case, probably because it exceeds some size threshold ... besides my device doesn't support GPU acceleration anyways.

The only thing I can recommend to folks for now is to use the native select, or disable animations for Android.

In the meantime, I'm going to try and allocate some time to try and figure out what these size thresholds are that trigger, the problem.

From the example in the bug, `$(""#myslider"").val('').slider('refresh');` , it appears that your check is sort of disjoint from the check against null above. That is, if the null check above went away, the check would only be looking to see if the `val` param was undefined. I've committed the following change from

For example, right now on the site it says: ""When you load the first page of a jQuery Mobile based site, then click a link or submit a form, the jQuery Mobile uses Ajax to pull in the content of the requested page."" And, I changed that to ""When you load the first page of a jQuery Mobile based site, then click a link or submit a form, Ajax is used to pull in the content of the requested page."" Saying ""the jQuery Mobile"" just seemed awkward to me, and I didn't think it needed to be repeated again in the same sentence anyway. 

Also, right now on the site it says ""The title of the HTML docuemnt will be,"" but the source in git has that already fixed. 

Anyway, I was just perusing the docs whilst just getting started with jqm, and noticed a few things. I'll be reviewing more over the coming days, and if I see stuff I'll note it (if that's helpful?).

Three quick updates that I made you might be interested in. 
- `$.fn.attr()` -> `$.fn.prop()` 

`disabled` is a boolean attribute and per the 1.6.1 docs `prop` is the prefered method for accessing and updating booleans on elements. Credit to @eddiemonge for pointing this out and helping me to understand that the distinction pertains mostly to boolean properties.

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/0ffaab8d223733a3695328630e5e9902f570baa1
- I chose to reference the text wrapper element directly instead of exposing the implementation via the class selector. This way the `buttonMarkup` helper can change how it creates and references the element without anyone having to know about the details.

My specific problem can be observed at http://www.pcaller.com/playcaller
Clicking on any of helmets should trigger a vclick event, and load another page.  This works fine in desktop browsers, IOS3, IOS4, Android, etc.  However in IOS5 vclick doesn't seem to fire.  If I instead bind to 'click' then everything works (albeit with the additional latency after touching).

@jblas can you confirm that vclick doesn't fire on your device?  I was only able to test it with a 3GS (running IOS5).  In the Apple simulator the problem seems to occur across all devices running IOS5.  All other versions seem fine.

The only default option I'm changing (AFAIK) is to disable the automatic AJAX transitions.

Thanks for looking.  I'm not entirely sure about the loading issue (I see it myself from time to time...) but refreshing tends to fix it.  The app is usually deployed with PhoneGap and isn't intended for pure web use, so I'm not too concerned with that right now.

Are you sure vmouseup isn't firing?  I am also binding to vmousedown and vmouseup on those helmets.  vmousedown causes the rectangle around the helmet to be drawn, vmouseup clears it, and vclick is supposed to load another page.  For me, the rectangle appears and disappears when clicking, so I assumed vmousedown and vmouseup were working properly.
I'm not calling preventDefault on either vmousedown or vmouseup (but I am on vclick...).

Using these clues, I tried to create a more directed example to mirror what I'm doing.
http://jsbin.com/omirod/35/edit#source
It seems that calling alert() in the vmousedown handler prevents both vmouseup and vclick from firing (but if the alert is not there, everything seems to work).  This suggests a timing-related issue, correct? (related to the time that the vmousedown handler takes).  This latest example on jsbin fails on my desktop browser and phone, so it might be a better place to focus.

2859,2011-11-02 21:26:21,"As @johnbender mentioned, we do not officially support query param passing to internal/embedded pages. When jQuery Mobile comes across ""#somePage?someId=1"" it passes it to jQuery core, which seems to interpret that as ""#somePage"" so it locates the internal page div, but then it tags it with a data-url of ""#somePage?someId=1"", which is why subsequent calls to ""#somePage?someId=2"" find the same div. The reason why it always displays ""#somePage?someId=1"" is because jQuery Mobile uses the data-url on the div which only gets set once.

I've seen enough of these internal page param requests that I went and wrote a plugin for folks. You can find it here:

https://github.com/jblas/jquery-mobile-plugins/tree/master/page-params

Thanks for the pull request. A couple quick notes:
1. It's best to split up the changeset into multiple commits eg, library changes, tests, doc additions. That way history traversal/viewing/manipulation is easier down the road.
2. This looks super nice, but this is the kind of thing the we might delegate to a plugin since it's hard to be in the business of knowing all, or even the best subset, of ways in which people will autodivide their listviews. I don't have the final word on this though so the team will have to discuss it.
3. If we merge this in it'll be post 1.0. So I'm going to close this for now, and I've added it to the top of our listview feature request set.

At a quick glance this does appear useful though and it's built in such a way that people should be able to drop this into their applications pretty easily. Have you considered blogging about this or posting it to the jquery plugins page?

I'd have to see an example of how you are doing things. The error above sounds as if you are trying to load a file:// file from a page you loaded from a remote server. I'm not sure what version of IE you are using but the jQuery.support.cors boolean is used to figure out if the browser supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):

http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/

Which requires specific HTTP header replies to work. Changing the value jQuery.support.cors value manually allows jQuery to always load a given URL, bypassing the cross-domain checks.

The config option mentioned by @johnbender is the flag on the jQuery Mobile side of the house, that allows us to prevent cross-domain loads, even in the case where CORS is supported by the browser.

I've actually seen this problem before. It's not actually firing multiple events. It's a bug in Chrome where it is echoing _EVERYTHING_ written to the log again any time you write to the log. If you actually attach the log-page-events bookmarklet, it somehow fills up the console buffer with enough text that the bug does not happen.

You can also verify that this is a console bug by simply throwing an alert. You will see that the alert only happens once as expected.

Because the parent page is hidden, it will be white, i think. Not always nice..

The code minified is 1.5kb and gzipped 691 bytes.  

To minimize performance impact while typing I used the same buffer,100 milliseconds with setTimeout clearTimeout, as what jqm currently is using to fire the auto grow on textarea, it will fire only every 100 millisecs.

Hope it helps.

to use with jqm, first the current jqm textarea events need to be removed:

2692,2011-10-20 21:17:05,"@toddparker, I was also wondering whether the Back link and the home icon/link are not too close to each other. You might argue that people actually getting the doc in full-screen would be capable of distinguishing between the 2 (and familiar with their difference). For example, I initially thought they made one single component. However, after trying both, I realised that they were 2 different components (one back, one home), so I am not too worried about that. 

If you change the link colour, you may want to also change the alink colour as well :-) 

Final point: The icon works really well.

It may be related to PhoneGap. I'm not sure whether it is just PhoneGap though, or the combination of PhoneGap and jQuery mobile.

Update: when running this fiddle together with Ripple (PhoneGap emulator) in the browser, the issue does not appear. I suspect this is because it runs with a normal PC keyboard: thus the on-screen virtual keyboard does not need to appear.

This makes me believe even more this is related to the virtual keyboard and resulting screen height changes. Then again, it does not appear in the jsfiddle with a virtual keyboard.

This may be caused by PhoneGap, which is awkward, since all it does is create a browser instance.

So the strange thing is that transition rules are only a factor during the transitions. Once the new page is showing, all transition related classes are removed, so the rules with the transforms, etc mentioned above are not in play at the time you would be clicking into a textfield on a given page.

The one thing I can see that both the transition and collapsible rules in question have are negative positionings/renderings to the left of the document. I'd be curious if we could factor out jQuery Mobile from this equation and create a plain vanilla HTML file with a similar negative offset rule applied and see if it happens. If so, then we need to report the bug to the Android folks as well as the PhoneGap folks.

I'm ok with delaying for post 1.0, as long as Theme Roller follows suit, but I really don't think this is an enhancement request, so I prefer it stays as an issue.

Relying on 2 different themes makes it harder for our users, who understand CSS, to style when they can't reliably tell what theme a component is using without looking at the code _OR_ opening up the developer tools of the browser to see what the run-time DOM looks like.

2658,2012-07-16 11:37:27,"@toddparker 

I think the getInheritedTheme function didn't exists yet when this issue was opened.

See the overview below. Where you see ""swatch C as fallback"" it is only used if no container with a body/bar swatch can be found. This basically means, only if the theme option for ""page"" has been set to something else than [a-z].
We could change it to A, but there is not really a need to do this (I am closing this ticket).

I suggest to add a small overview to the ""Theme Framework"" page that shows for what element a default swatch has been set in options. A checklist of what you might have to configure if you use a custom theme.

Overview - this applies if you haven't specified a swatch:
- page: swatch C as default in options
- content: inherits by default
- form elements & buttonMarkup: inherits, swatch C as fallback
- collapsible: inherits, swatch C as fallback
- listviews: inherits, swatch C as fallback
  - dividers: swatch B as default in options
  - nested list headers: swatch B as default in options
  - split theme: swatch B as default in options
  - count bubble: swatch C as default in options
- error message: swatch E as default for option pageLoadErrorMessageTheme
- loader: swatch A as default in options
- header & footer: swatch A as default in options
- navbar: inherits

Issues that I will look into:
- select: the count bubble for multi-selects always uses swatch C
- popup: getInheritedTheme doesn't work correctly

Why FF 7.0.1 is the only browser that's raising this issue?
A position of _absolute_ says, the element stays _above_ the others and do not affect other elements.
But, its position is relative to the borders of the parent, if the parent has a positioning too.
""Our"" parent is the header of the collapsible and it is positioned relative.
So the ""hidden"" collapsible-heading-status-span is -9999px left _inside_ its parent span,

It looks like requirejs [optimizer](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html) with [r.js](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js) is pretty comprehensive and provides docs on how to pipeline the output properly through the closure compiler.

More to come.

2631,2011-10-21 20:44:34,"I confirm what @redaemn says, if you drag the slider enough to go over half-way then, it will always stop where you release it, even if you drag it back to the initial half of the slider. However, I believe that even if the animation is stopped in the middle (I have managed to drag the handle and stop it in the middle on FF 7.0.1 MacOS, Safari 5.0.5 MacOS, iPad2 iOS4 and iPod Touch2 iOS4), the switch is still always on a specific value. You can try http://jsfiddle.net/agcolom/AYZNd/7/show and press the submit button. It should tell you whether the switch is on 'yes' or 'no'. 

I was wondering whether it is not an issue with the event used? and if the user 'drags' the switch, would it help to map the drag on the switch to an actual mouse click?

The URL isn't being updated because you've specified a changeHash:false. If you set it to true, or don't specify it at all, the URL should update as you expect.

Thanks for the sample!

@toddparker

Looking at the sample, and watching the page/popstate/hashchange events,  it looks as if it may be a popstate implementation bug. I can actually reproduce the bug in desktop Safari 5.0.5 (Windows).

When Safari loads page2, a popstate event is actually fired by the browser, but the event object it passes has the state object for the previous page (index) .

As far as I know popstate should not be fired when navigating to a new document.

I need to check if the scripts in the body are contributing to this weird behavior.

We can't actually check against the current page because of the way the popstate is supposed to work, and does work, in many browsers. That is, it should load the old root document and pop any states that were pushed onto that document for the javascript to handle. If we prevent loading based on the url we block other browsers from restoring state. 

@Neiru 

We can't disable the first popstate arbitrarily for the same reason

",mathiasconradt,jblas
2596,2011-10-27 01:24:42,"@jblas Thanks for info, I will put any new issues in new tickets then. Just to clarify: the problem is not that the footer disappears in the beginning, but that it does not reappear in general in so many cases, i.e. when releasing any touch or scroll.
For example, another case is that I have a screen that's not actually scrollable, but where I have a background image larger than the screen, but with css attribute: #splashPage {height:100%;overflow:hidden;} and some content elements that go beyond the screen height (which is fine, I just want to ensure that the entire screen is filled).
With that, I can just touch the screen anywhere (doesn't even scroll due to the overflow style), and the footer disappears without even re-appearing(!) again after releasing the touch and waiting for a while.

As a workaround I now use a plugin for the footer, which appears to make the behaviour more stable, as it's demoed here: http://yappo.github.com/projects/jquery.mobile.iscroll/livedemo.html 
It's exactly the same behaviour as the default jqm footer, it hides the footer when user touches the screen or scrolls (which is fine), but the footer does re-appear (!) again, that's the main point I want to point out here actually.

So it seems I can reproduce this problem with Windows Safari 5.0.5 (Desktop).

Yes, setting domCache = true globally works as advertised: pages remain in cache. However, since my apps have dynamic content on every page, I need a method to invalidate that content so that it will be reloaded whenever the page is viewed. If I remove pages from the cache myself, back / forward navigation can lead to blank pages.

Thanks for confirming my findings. I would still consider it more of an issue than a feature request because it is not how I would expect the domCache option to work. I understand that much of the reasoning behind introducing this option is to keep memory usage down. However, another reason to use this option is to control the caching of pages, which is vital to any app with dynamic content. Even if you'd like to keep domCache working as is, I strongly feel that there should be some way to invalidate pages to force content to be reloaded.

Thanks for hearing me out! I'm certainly willing to pitch in to help once a consensus emerges on the proper approach.

Thanks for the clarification. I agree that the inability to cleanly remove cached pages is a separate issue from the ""sticky"" initial page when caching is disabled. Maybe they should be separated in Github. A fix to either issue would be most appreciated and allow me to upgrade my apps.

Although I said that the removal of cached pages on pagehide hasn't worked since Alpha4, I verified that it also works in Beta1 (but hasn't worked since then). I've tried simply removing pages from the DOM and also manipulating the $.mobile.urlHistory.stack without success. 

If it would be useful, I could cook up a demo of the problem(s).

Does your fix also remove the first page when data-dom-cache=""false""? The fact that this doesn't happen is surprising to many developers (as illustrated by the length of this thread). This scenario is covered in this branch of my test:

2520,2011-11-04 20:39:03,"Thanks very much for the fix @jblas. I've confirmed that selective caching of pages is now possible, regardless of whether pages have been embedded. I created a new branch to my test project to illustrate how selective caching can be done:

https://github.com/dgeb/jquery-mobile-test/tree/jqm1.0_latest_with_selective_caching

In this sample, you can set data-dom-cache=""true"" on individual pages to force them to be cached. All others will be removed by a pageshow event handler like this:



For the record, I still don't understand the special status being given to embedded pages. Even if multiple pages are embedded in the initially loaded page, they could be subject to the same rules of dom caching as external pages if marked with data-dom-cache=""true"". This would negate the need for custom code (like my example) to override the default (and IMO unexpected) caching behavior.

Hi,
here's the markup that's generated

This:



Generates this:



_(well ..one can just write the markup out by hand too)_

The only thing that changes is either data-ajax will be true or false, the rest of the markup stays the same.

If data-ajax is true, jqm will try to load a non existent page (since the partial code does not contain any page role), and if data-ajax is set to false, jqm will navigate away from the page, which is pretty logical, since it's a href after all.

Here's some doc on jQuery unobtrusive, which is pretty much the default now in MVC3:
http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/mvc3-unobtrusive-ajax.html

From what i heard, the next version of Visual Studio & MVC4 will even be shipping with JQM

Would be nice if there was a solution, maybe something similar to data-ajax=[true|false|custom]

For now i am using this:



I actually have to pass the parameter via the url, otherwise i wasn't able to produce this behavior on a per/link basis.

Robert
",itechnology,johnbender
2514,2011-09-27 23:41:29,"@toddparker

Np, the solution i posted above works perfectly fine for me. So i'm happy with that for now :)

I do have a suggestion for a solution though, so here goes:
- JQM introduces a third parameter to data-ajax: data-ajax=[true|false|custom]
  - This would permit short-circuiting jqm's link handling behavior like jblas mentioned above
  - If set to custom, jqm just ignores all handling, and expects third party handling
  - This would permit one to set the behavior on a per/link, per/form basis
- Microsoft moves their data-ajax-true namespace to data-ajax-enabeled=true for example
  - This would involve updating their server-side AjaxHelpers & their client-side jquery.unobtrusive.js 

Now when AjaxHelpers are used outside of a jqm environment, regular syntax will simply apply, and when used inside a jqm environment, one would just need to supply it with an additional parameter to render an extra attribute of data-ajax=custom

Thank's again,
Robert

Allow me some short words about selectmenus:
To use long non-native selects is always a fight with the occurring page events if they used at the parent...
And, as it seems, they are a problem with the dom management too.
Excuse me if i talk about iOS now, but the native select on ipad shows a nice to use 
scrollable canvas and not a full screen-page, if the selectlist is long.
A long option-list is most often not a wide one. And if, just the font-size is scaled down.
Why the team not just make the small-non-native-select to a long, scrollable select,
if more options inside than educible
And, this would be the icing on the cake and would hit the iOS select, an integrated, switchable search on the top.

2452,2011-09-15 18:42:40,"Hi @johnbender,

The main problem we are running into with data-dom-cache=""true"" is the framework we are running on our backend to generate our markup.  When the form is submitted with errors, the same page is returned, except with our error messages in the dom.  The problem is now the error page and the original form page are in the dom, both with the same id's on all the elements, this has been causing various problems for us.

Another problem is that we have fairly complex caching requirements, and having to manage the dom ""by hand"" has proven to be quite challenging in some scenarios, like nested list pages.  The browser cache solution is much cleaner for us, and currently is working perfectly except this one problem.

Also, we have a fairly large set of pages we need cached, some of them may have large lists of data.  One our of business requirements unfortunately is to implement a pseudo fixed header with iScroll.  To have a decent scrolling speed, some of our dom elements have to be added to the hardware acceleration layer as described here: http://cubiq.org/you-shall-not-flicker.  I fear having all these different pages with these elements in the dom at once may cause problems.

Thanks!

2452,2011-09-16 18:46:33,"The scenario I am trying to support is the same behavior of the back button as if the page wasn't enhanced by JQuery Mobile.  The form is submitted, you hit back button, and the data is there.  I wanted to achieve this without the use of the dom cache, for the reasons I listed above.

I now see the fix doesn't solve my issue, I applied the fix incorrectly.  I had ""reverse:  reverse"" as an option without setting it above the function call... the result seems to be that it breaks the AJAX request and falls back on a non ajax form submit, and because the form submit wasn't via ajax, the back button preserves the form data.

So I guess the solution for me, if it can't be done via ajax, is to set data-ajax=""false"" on my form.  It would be nice to have to have the ajax transition back with the data preserved without using dom cache, but I don't know if it's technically possible.

I just ran into this issue of the form submit and back buttons as well. What happens is after the form submit, the back button goes back to the same form. The reason for this is jQueryMobile uses .changePage() for the submits and the entry is placed into the $.mobile.urlHistory : this basically duplicates entries for the form every time you submit. 

If you change the .changePage() on form submit by adding changeHash : false ; the back button works correctly.

I believe, changeHash : false is a correct way of handling this, at least on ""POST""s anyways, as you don't want people to navigate back to the POSTed pages.

It's going to be a little extra work, but if you want to take advantage of pushstate URLs, you'll need to serve the full HTML content when the request is coming from regular HTTP rather than Ajax. I'd recommend doing this by checking the x-requested-with header to see if it's a request coming from Ajax or not, and negotiating your markup delivery based on that. 

In the end, doing this will make your site/app work on pretty much all devices, even C-Grade, or in devices where JS is not supported, available, etc.

I think this may be a bug in the implementation of pushstate/replacestate in Chrome. After reading several docs, including:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/history.html

Specifically:

http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/history.html#history
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/history.html#history-traversal

I'm left with the impression that the correct behavior on back(), even if the document DOM were not cached in-memory, is to reload page1 (the main application document) and then generate a popstate event with the URL for page2. That is indeed how it is implemented in Mozilla, and how they have documented it on their page at the URL above.

I think we should file an issue with the Chrome guys and see what they say.

So as I demoed to you guys then, I've been developing a similar framework but only targeting Android2.2+, Blackberry6+, and iPhone. Even with just the best of the best, mobile web dev is extremely challenging. Kudos and big thanks to Todd and his team for doing so much even against the odds. These browsers are truly buggy.

For what I did in my app is I allow true fixed positioning only in Android. 
[data-platform=""android""] .top-toolbar {position: fixed; top:0; left: 0;}

iPhone's fixed positioning on iOS5 is buggy. To handle this, I use overflow:scroll on the main container (stuff below the toolbar, and below a bottom tab bar), and dynamically set the height of the incoming view on view change. But! overflow-scrolling-touch causes critical bugs. So currently my app doesn't have momentum scrolling on iOS5. I'm sure sure Apple is fixing that right now.

Different strategies can be deployed on different platforms to get the optimum experiences.

Android 2.2 - position fixed
iOS5 - overflow scroll
Everything else - the nice fade in/out top and bottom toolbars jQueryMobile already supplies.

If ya'll want any help, I could try to jump into the code base and see if I can figure out a scalable arch for maximizing features on different phones, if you haven't already.

Thinking about this a bit more. We shouldn't be removing and restoring event handlers outside of the navigation code that does the pruning. Instead, we should probably introduce a concept of a lock attribute that the remove binding checks before actually executing the remove(). That way we can keep the details of how a page is pruned in one spot in the framework.

The locking mechanism can be a $.mobile.xxx API function that sets and/or increments a lock attribute on domCache=false elements.

EDIT: sorry, I missed the bottom part of your post; you are right. However I don't call that transparent, nor do others who I have seen struggling with the same issue. In fact _every_ JQuery mobile site made by devs (freelancers and employees) have this issue on at least 1 instance; everyone ASSUMES that it will work transparent, while it doesn't. What makes it harder is that it works the first time ofcourse (logically), so devs assume it works and then the client says it doesn't. I see your POV, however: 

""To enable animated page transitions, all links that point to an external page (ex. products.html) will be loaded via Ajax. To do this unobtrusively, the framework parses the link's href to formulate an Ajax request (Hijax) and displays the loading spinner. All this happens automatically by jQuery Mobile.""

Makes you believe the process is transparent wether you run via normal HTML or JQuery mobile => AKA you expect linking to work the same. But it doesn't. People who are USED to AJAX and have Firebug on 24/7, they can see this happening and understand it. But JQuery-mobile is supposed to be a framework which is easy to use meaning that a LOT of people working with it will never (or hardly) touch any jQuery but will just use HTML. And from that POV this is not transparent and I believe it should be addressed somehow. 

------ the rest I typed before, might be helpful, but we were already talking about the same thing. 

I'm not sure that's the case; the JQuery mobile transparent AJAX code (which parses the hrefs) makes this problem happen. If I switch Jquery mobile _off_ or if I used the non AJAX links everything works as expected. To make it more clear, before clicking the link; 

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6134596/Screenshots/6cp9w~3tg1r0.png

Then after clicking the link (as you can see there and in the link to stackoverflow I posted above; I copied and used that guy his code because it's simple and it's easy to reproduce the issue), it looks like this; 

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6134596/Screenshots/6516r8kdj528.png

As you can see, without me adding any code, just a standard link in JQuery-mobile, it copied a large part of the DOM and now there are two ids #show. This is logical, as AJAX does that and because we are pointing to the same page, the ids are the same after AJAX. However that's far from transparent and it's an issue I've now seen many times in IRC and in Stackoverflow and forums; people, after reading the docs of JQuery mobile expect transparent AJAX usage as described, but get, instead, 'weird' behavior. Logical behavior, but weird and not very convenient. And I think it's fixable on the JQuery-mobile side. 

But I might be wrong; then I would suggest as fix to make this clear in the documentation if it's a 'cannot or will not fix' in the code?

2308,2011-11-19 18:51:19,"This is not unique to jquery mobile. You can't upload a file using normal AJAX methods. I think the reason it worked before is that the form didnt submit with ajax.

So there are a couple of ""solutions"" here.

First, mark this as needsdoc to say that if you want to send files you will need to turn ajax off for the form as suggested by @bendoo.

Second, have the above happen automatically and document it.

Third, have the form submit over ajax using the iframe technique.

Drawback to the first method is that the user has to read the docs and be aware of this limitation.

Drawback to the third method is the ""after"" part:
- Does the iframe then get converted to a normal ""page"" and then transitioned to it? If so, that is going to be a lot more code as it will need to convert the page and add it to stack. Also, it would probably need some kind of indicator that the file is uploading. Seems like a lot of work for not a whole lot of return value.
- Does the iframe only return some kind of status message and thus it is up to the user to figure out what to do with that message? This is just as bad as the first message

Yeah I remember when Scott landed the widget decoupling that I was thinking we really needed to formalize the phases a page goes through so we can dispatch appropriate events to give folks hooks to:
- Extract info from the raw page markup _BEFORE_ and _AFTER_ enhancement.
- Modify the default page markup _BEFORE_ enhancement.
- Modify the page markup _AFTER_ enhancement.

Something like:

pageinserted (Raw markup loaded and inserted into the DOM)
pageinit (Kickoff enhancement)
pageready (Ready to be used)

I'd really like to leave the extra events until after the 1.0 if we could. I'm happy to add it to the feature wiki. 

In the meantime since we have folks with code that need to alter enhanced markup and we've since shifted our widgets down the event stack a tad we can add the following event in the as yet unused `init` method of the jqm widget factor extension.

There are a couple of options here with trade-offs.
1. Add our own `_init` implementation as in the patch I posted above. One downside here is if someone wants to extend the jquerymobile widget they need to juggle the init to preserve our events. I talked with @ajpiano and he said that in jqueryui 1.9 it will invoke the super method so we've be fine here in the future as long as we plan to upgrade the jqueryui widget factory. My only real concern is that someone, somewhere has extended the mobile widget, defined init, and will hate me for all eternity if I break their code.
2. Decorate the `_create` method with a follow up `_trigger( 'aftercreate' )`. Fragile and is generally not very robust in the face of change. I don't like monkeypatching/decorating it surprises people and me down the road.
3. Alter the `jquery.ui.widget.js` and add the `_trigger( 'aftercreate' )` to the end of the `_create` method after the call to `_init`. Downside being that we now have to manage changes to the ui widget vs our patch unless we decide talk with the ui guys and move it upstream. In the latter case it would actually be `_trigger( 'init' )` to follow on with the convention of calling `_trigger( 'create' )` after calling the `_create` method. 

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.ui.widget.js#L158

You'll notice above that line the ordering goes create, trigger create, init, no trigger. 

I'll probably go with the first option and ask @toddparker to write it up in the blogpost in the hopes that people will raise an alarm. I still think `aftercreate` is the right event in this case.

Why not just call the event ""init"" ... and place the trigger after the init call in the UI base widget?

That way all widgets end up with a:

- &lt;widget&gt;init - Widget has been constructed and initialized and is ready to go.

2211,2011-10-07 20:32:32,"@johnbender, I actually have `data-dome-cache=true` set on my parent page to maintain its state, but unfortunately its pageshow/pagehide events still fire which results in page manipulations that are not wanted.

IMHO, even though a dialog is actually another page, I think it would be great to have an option added to `$.mobile.changePage` that when combined with opening a dialog allows the parent page to remain in the DOM and it's pageshow/pagehide events do not fire. That way it truly acts like a dialog, and is a modal that leaves the page below untouched.

Is the issue the difference between single and multiple page apps? I use multiple html files, which makes create/show behave much like the show/blur described here. An additional event that appears to do the same as an existing event may be confusing.

I haven't looked into the code to see how easy it would be to implement, but adding some additional information to the pageshow event could help - either the id/role of the previous page or a flag indicating that the transition was triggered with back. With this information the pageshow handler can easily determine that the page state hasn't changed since it was last shown and skip the update.

Though I disagree with @anpsince83 on updating parent pages directly from dialogs, the reference to the previous page would also be useful in that context.

@johnbender Do you guys do something that might tell the browser to cancel loading a page? I wonder, if that happens on a UIWebView's first page then it seems that the UIWebView's history management doesn't get initialized correctly and the back behavior breaks.

The header and footer get theme A by default, unless you specify something else. They don't inherit the theme from the page.
I am not sure what you meant by ""correct theme"", but it works as expected on your test page. Maybe this was different a year ago. Anyway, closing as fixed.

The code in my JS Bin was a bit sloppy. You are right that you have to prevent that the binding to `pageshow` happens each time the `pageinit` fires.
Probably even better to do this... `$(document).on(""pageinit"", ""#pageID"", function() {...`

It just occurred to me when I was thinking about this the other day ... that on some platforms, if you allow the browser to scroll the viewport, they stop dispatching touch events, including the touchend ... this would be bad because it wouldn't remove the touchmove or touchend listeners it added during touchstart off the element.
",jblas,toddparker
2107,2011-10-10 21:03:38,"@toddparker

What I was trying to say was that removing that line completely, will allow the viewport to scroll, which may have bad consequences on the platforms that stop dispatching touchmove/touchend if the viewport scrolls.

2107,2012-03-23 17:17:47,"@toddparker 

So I'm a bit confused here. As I mentioned above, we can remove the checks around the preventDefault() and always execute it, but it sounded as if @adriancd wanted it removed completely to make performance better? Also @francescortiz comment is a bit confusing because calling preventDefault() should stop scrolling ... unless he is testing on Android, where calling preventDefault does nothing, you actually have to call preventDefault on the touchstart.

What is the desired behavior here? To not scroll when swiping? Or to allow scrolling and still generate a swipe?

2107,2012-07-18 16:33:32,"@jblas @toddparker - I was doing some testing last night on my shiny new Nexus 7 and noticed that listview scrolling performance was about as bad as I've ever experienced in the project I've been working on for the past 8 months or so.  I've read all the posts that suggest to disable drop shadows and other css to make the listview style as simple as possible.  I've also read all the posts about how bad scrolling performance is when the listview items are links (&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;whatever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;).  So, I removed the &lt;a&gt; tags and made my listviews just listviews that don't link to anything.  Scrolling performance was still the same...horrible.  But, then I noticed that if I scrolled on the left or right side of the listview very carefully without touching the listview items, then scrolling was vastly improved (close to native).  But, I just didn't understand why scrolling seemed to stop anytime my scroll ventured just a wee bit over to where it hovered over any listview item while scrolling.

As a test, I changed it to 100 and it drastically improved the scrolling performance (because it was no longer suppressing it).  I put the &lt;a&gt; tags back in just to make sure everything was still breezing along and sure enough...listview scrolling was still vastly improved.

I haven't taken the time to investigate the side-effects of setting it to 100, but I can't imagine any side effect would be worse than suppressing my scrolling.

",jblas,dcarrith
2107,2012-07-18 23:52:56,"@jblas - Good f'n question!  I didn't think to comment out the swipeleft and swiperight event handlers to see if that scrollSupressionThreshold would still be used for differentiating between a scroll with a swipe.  After commenting them out, scrolling is very much improved since that moveHandler code isn't trying to grab stop and start position and then compare all the thresholds, which most of the time seems to evaluate to true because of some wacky values ... thereby calling preventDefault.  

So, the next test I did was to comment out all the code inside of the swipeleft and swiperight which was actually an old hack that dates back to when double and triple events would be fired for swipeleft and swiperight.  So, now I just have two empty swipeleft and swiperight handlers:

$('body').on('swipeleft', function(evt, ui) {
//empty
});

$('body').on('swiperight', function(evt, ui) {
// empty
});

I added in an alert right above the event.preventDefault just to see what it's comparing to scrollSupressionThreshold each time and am seeing some strange values (On Galaxy Nexus ICS 4.0.4 in a Cordova App as well as Chrome and on a Nexus 7 in a cordova app and in Chrome).  I'm not really sure what to make of it.  But, in the simplest test, if you scroll on one side of the listview and then scroll on the other side of the listview, the if statement evaluates to true and event.preventDefault is called.  Even with the smallest scroll, it triggers and the alerts I have in place are all over the map.  It's really hard to describe.  But, if you have a chance, throw this alert in there and take a look.     

// prevent scrolling
if ( Math.abs( start.coords[ 0 ] - stop.coords[ 0 ] ) > $.event.special.swipe.scrollSupressionThreshold ) {
    alert(""Math.abs(""+start.coords[0]+"" - ""+stop.coords[0]+"") > ""+$.event.special.swipe.scrollSupressionThreshold+""\n so, would normally have called event.preventDefault to prevent scrolling"");
    event.preventDefault();

When they are finished I take the form and post it back to the server.  Wrapping all of the pages in a single FORM element allows me to keep all of the input together on the client and prevents me from needing to go back to the server between each page request.

Re: `if (elm.type !== ""text"") { /* number input supported, probably spinners, so add extra padding... */`

If the input type is not ""text"" it doesn't mean it is ""number"" (""date"", ""tel"", ""password"", ""file"", ""search"").
We could target the number input in CSS (`input[type=""number""]`) to set extra padding, but I am not in favor of this because I don't agree with ""probably spinners"". So far I've only seen them on Chrome desktop, Safari desktop, Opera desktop, and Opera Mobile.
Other solution is to set extra margin on the spinner (`-webkit-inner/outer-spin-button`) but that probably looks a bit weird.

About the date input: On Safari desktop a spinner is added. Chrome desktop, Opera desktop, and Opera Mobile show a ""select indicator"" for the datepicker. On Chrome for Android there is no indicator for the datepicker, but the clear button doesn't work.

Device: Verizon HTC Droid Incredible 
OS: Android 2.2 
Browser: Webkit 3.1

I have a basic carousel HTML structure set up on my page, in which an absolutely positioned DIV (.product_carousel_slider) is meant to slide around inside of a relatively positioned DIV, when the user triggers a ""swipeleft"" or ""swiperight"" event.

$('.product_carousel_slider').bind('swipeleft swiperight', function(e){
    e.preventDefault();
    xProductCarousel.moveCarousel(e.type);
}

(inside of xProductCarousel object:)
moveCarousel:function(sEventType){
    var scrollAmount = xProductCarousel.nViewportWidth;
    this.nCurrentPosition = (sEventType === 'swipeleft') ? this.nCurrentPosition - scrollAmount : this.nCurrentPosition + scrollAmount;



}

This works as expected on other Android devices I've tested, including the Kindle Fire, the HTC Inspire. Also works well on the iPhone. The problem is that on my test HTC Droid Incredible, the browser freezes, and only after the user touches/clicks in desperation does the browser slowly come back to life.

Your commit is correct but one more correction to apply:

correction: 2 or more history length, right? ==> no

You might confusing about history length and $( "".ui-page"" ).length
@toddparker (and also me!) wants a back button if history lenght is 1 or more.
Additionally you need to change the auto-add back btn condition. You will need to change following condition 
current ==> $( "".ui-page"" ).length > 1 
expected ==> $( "".ui-page"" ).length > 0 

This will eliminate the issue where back button disappears after a refresh. And also help us to work with non-ajax environment (look <a href=""https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1644"">issue 1644</a>)

I believe the positioning of the base tag in the head is important during page load/parsing. Any relative URLs before the base tag is encountered is resolved relative to the document URL. Any relative urls after it are resolved using the base URL.

@gm90

When are you setting your image src attributes? @StevenBlack is correctly pointing out that jQuery Mobile adjusts the base tag when pulling in content dynamically. It then resets it back to the document base when its done so I'm wondering how/when you are adjusting the src attributes.

I had the weirdest problem with this. I'll start from the top:

I was using the 1.04a1 which was loading images without any issues, however in a dynamic thumbnail list the first list item was not being styled properly on a .listview() refresh. On switching to the nightly builds images that were dynamically added failed to load whereas those that were included in the index.html and css loaded fine despite following the exact same relative paths. 

@StevenBlack I am using the latest nightly builds along with the latest jquery javascript file.

@jblas to answer your question. In my app I have a link tab dedicated to 'News', when this page is loaded an ajax request is used to load an xml rss feed, at which point the image src attributes are updated and the listview is refreshed to update the styling.

As mentioned previously I found the issue to reside at:

line 448
var fauxBase = location.protocol + '//' + location.host + location.pathname,

For some reason this is pointing to (notice the extra slash after the www directory):

""file:///var/mobile/mobile/Applications/1D19-E6F1-3C62-4967-80D5-DD5D091B24A6/test.app/www//index.html""

However upon removing the hardcoded url and returning to the original line all be it minus the 'ui-dir/' ending my app began to display the images once again.



I have now submitted my app, but over the past few days based on others comments here I have a horrible feeling my test devices may have cached the hardcoded links. If this is the case I'm pretty sure it will get the book thrown at it in the review process lol. Schoolboy error on my behalf to not clear the cache but time will tell.

@jammus

In your snippet



won't this treat any and all requests as file system requests even when they aren't request to the cache or file system so long as the app cache is valid? So if the user is online, the cache is valid, and he/she makes a request for a page not listed in the manifest it really should be requested as normal (ie not `isLocal`). Again, I'm just eyeballing it so if I'm off course you'll have to forgive me.

@hakanson and @ksksks I would ask the same of both:



and



`isLocal` appears to make sense when you can verify that the user _cannot_ make web requests and should only be able to retrieve the material from the cache. If you look at the jquery xhr handling the reason this seems to work is that, _right now_, it only really cares about `isLocal` for coercing the status into something sane when the value is 0 and not cross domain.

Yeah, you're right. It treats all requests as local when a cache exists. As you point out though it is a bit of a hack. Maybe the check or one similar should be pushed into xhr.js in jQuery main rather than relying purely on isLocal behaving this way forever.

1555,2011-06-23 14:39:07,"Thanks for the feedback. We're in the process of working on a system for automating page removal without removing certain types of pages that can't be refetched from the server (nested listview pages, local multipages, dynamically generated pages, etc). It's likely that we'll implement this in two ways: first, a configurable limit for the max number of pages to keep in the dom at any time (which could default to something quite low, maybe zero, who knows), and second, a simple mechanism to specify that a certain page should never be stored in the DOM, or that a certain page type should never be removed from the DOM through the max-limit flushing. 

@wietsevenema makes a good point, and I generally agree that simply recommending standard cache configuration settings is a good way to go, but we'll need to test how well this plays out on mobile devices with limited capabilities, even newer ones.

This eliminates most, but not all, unintended tapholds on the Playbook.

1476,2012-06-08 01:07:35,"I agree @MauriceG - as discussed above, this looks like an issue where iOS doesn't parse new content added to the DOM for phone numbers to auto-link, not that tel: links aren't working (we fixed that). Unless someone knows how to trigger the default iOS behavior, I'm not sure how we could make this work. I think auto parsing HTML for phone like patterns like the native behavior does would be overreaching. I'd suggest that if you want something to be a linked phone number, that you use the tel: link format and not reply on the various OSs doing this for you.

I'm going to close this because it can't really be fixed from what I understand. I tagged this as a feature request so we can review this at a later point to see if either iOS changes their behavior or if we want to polyfill this on our side.

1464,2011-09-02 18:55:07,"@22222 @toddparker 

I'm not sure the ""tap"" event was intended to be an alias for the ""click"" event. I think the intent was to give the developer some way to trigger an action on touchend (for touch devices) instead of waiting the 300ms or so before the browser got around to synthesizing the related mouseup/click. With that intent in mind, I'm not sure calling preventDefault() on a ""tap"" event should prevent the default action of a link.

Now ""vclick"" is a different story. Calling preventDefault() on a ""vclick"" event should prevent a link for executing its default action. It actually does do what you expect on a touch device, but there is currently a bug in the mouse event handling code for jquery.mobile.vmouse.js where the isDefaultPrevented(), isPropagationStopped(), and isImmediatePropagationStopped() settings are not being propagated from the virtual event to the original mouse event. I have a fix for this.

In all 3 cases (""vclick"", ""tap"", and ""taphold"") the stopPropagation() and stopImmediatePropagation() should _NOT_ execute any handlers that follow the one doing the stop, and the events should cease to bubble up the DOM tree.

There seems to be a bug in the implementation of ""taphold"" where 2 elements in the same parent/child hierarchy that are bound to ""taphold"" each fire-off their own ""taphold"" timer. This means that if the child element is the thing being tapped, 2 timers will be fired off, one for the child and one for the parent/ancestor, resulting in 2 different events bubbling up the tree.

1383,2014-08-20 16:59:36,"@gabrielschulhof I think there may still be an issue lurking in the code here.

As per our earlier discussions, and the ""correct"" behavior, the data-url specified in markup is NOT url encoded -- just HTML entity encoded where necessary. It looks like the code in `_loadSuccess` is extracting the `data-url` from the markup -- should it be url encoded at that time for consistency?

Thus, when the URL is updated (via `replaceState`), it ends up being unencoded, so if you refresh the page, the query string is broken because the `&` is parsed as another parameter.

I think the issue here is that any pages inside the app document have ids on them, if you then go and load an external page, which has a link to the original app document (for progressive enhancement purposes) and you click it, there's a mismatch because the page they really want to navigate to has a data-url that is the #id of the element, while the ajax loading code is searching for a data-url with the path specified in the link.

I think we may need to handle this special case.

@alexfalkowski, does it make a difference if the url to the original page ends with #id?

1243,2011-09-21 19:54:10,"@toddparker @scottjehl

I think the gist of this bug is that when folks dynamically inject a page, they aren't tagging it with a @data-url attribute, so we aren't finding it. I suppose I can add some fallback code that checks to see if the page being requested is an embedded page, and if its not found via the data-url lookup, we could always do a 2nd pass lookup by id. What do you think?

We're already doing a fallback 2nd pass for catching references to the first embedded page of the application document since that might not have an id, and therefore no data-url value, associated with it.

I believe this is coming from the vmouseover and vmouseout handlers in buttonMarkup.js. If you want to totally eliminate hover class for buttonMarkup on touch devices, we could just switch back to plain-old mouseover and mouseout, which won't get generated on Touch devices. What do you think?
",jblas,toddparker
1215,2011-09-20 02:16:07,"Hi @jblas - let's go ahead and make this switch. The mouse events will cover the desktop and focus-based interaction modes and eliminate the scroll hover state oddness on touch.
",toddparker,jblas
1215,2011-09-20 22:21:41,"@toddparker

Turns out the state we are seeing when touch is started is actually the ui-btn-down class, and not the ui-btn-hover as first thought. To me this makes things a bit different since disabling that, or moving it to placing those classes on the real-mouse events means we will never see these feedback visuals for all buttonMarkup components on a touch device.

I verified that we are indeed generating a vmousecancel event in the case that a touch results in a scroll, so we _ARE_ removing the ui-btn-down class ... it's just that the screen won't update till you actually lift your finger since the browser caches the viewport bitmap while you are drag-scrolling.

I think we're going to punt on this. Closing per @toddparker.

Judging from the comments here and the fact that using the jqm emulation produces the desired result it sounds like everyone expects this to be a post orientationchange event. That is an event that is triggered when the orientation changes and the document element size has been altered. The docs are actually ambiguous as to whether the orientation value will be pre/post change.

When bound to this event, your callback function can leverage a second argument, which contains an orientation property equal to either ""portrait"" or ""landscape"".

There's a case to be made for having an orientation change event that fires _before_ the document element has resized, but for now after I double check with the team I'll look into making the current `orientationchange` event include the post resize orientation value and clarifying the documentation a bit.

Your not the first to ask for this option, and perhaps we should consider a way to turn it off via a config option. The problem that @toddparker was referring to above was that without doing the ""scroll to the top"", transitions to new pages will result in a change in the document height ... the problem is different browsers do different things when this happens. Some stay at the current scroll offset even when the document height is less than that offset, resulting in what looks like a blank page, while others will adjust accordingly showing you the bottom of the new page content. Aside from this problem, it just looks wierd to see a transition that doesn't involve the top of a document.

Believe me when I say we have tried several times to figure out how to make this smoother, for example offsetting the rendering of the new page by the current scroll position during the transition, etc ... but we always get bitten by blinky/flashing rendering when we fix the scroll position for the new page because the browser thinks it hasn't rendered that part of the document.

I just wanted to give you a feeling of the types of issues you may come up against if we give an option to turn this behavior off.

Ok, as I started this thing, I guess I should wade in.  

I completely understand where the core team are coming from on this. Switching all the CSS to SCSS etc was easy enough, but I've always had nagging doubts in my mind if I've converted everything correctly.  I think I've always managed to do a decent job as no one ever complained, but there is no 100% guarantee of the conversion being perfect. I did wonder about doing file to file comparisons, but that was never going to be perfect either.

I also get the argument about not having too many barriers to some developers, however I would say the barrier to SASS or LESS is a lot less now as more and more developers are starting to adopt them.  Now I'm a big fan of SASS, and quite vocal about it, but at the same time I'm not a believer in forcing techs onto people.  My personal opinion on why SASS vs LESS is simply down to Compass.  For me it's always been about Compass and all the tools that provides. (Oh yeah, and I'm no fan of getting JavaScript to handle all the styling, but that's a different argument :))

Anyway, back to the point.  I can't see SASS or LESS being adopted into this project, for the good reasons that @johnbender has raised.  There is however clearly a call for this, so here's what I suggest. 
1. I pull my finger out and actually start maintaining my Compass plugin - https://github.com/pollingj/jQuery-Mobile-SASS
2. The core dev team point people in the direction of the plugin, maybe making it an official SASS / Compass plugin?
3. Whenever any changes are made to the CSS let me know and I'll get the necessary SASS stuff updated.  (To be honest this was always my biggest issue - having to start over again with the conversion).
4. Developers start contributing to the Compass plugin :)
5. If someone wants a LESS version, then they should just create a separate version, and again get the core dev team to point to it. Clearly the SASS version will be superior though ;)

So, lastly, apologies for letting my project slip so badly. Unfortunately I've not needed it myself for some time, so I've let it all slip.  (You know the story).

A large jQM project I've been working on over the last month or so presented the opportunity to leverage SCSS and Compass for code maintainability. During the theming process, I took it upon myself to convert a considerable amount of the base jQM structure and theme CSS into Compass mixins, switched the static image icons over to using font icons, added mixins for generating retina and non-retina sprite sheets, etc.

While this conversion process isn't yet complete, I think the work and insight so far could benefit the community quite extensively.

453,2013-01-07 12:31:38,"@toddparker - I've posted the work I've hammered out so far at https://github.com/sghoweri/jquery-mobile

If you check out https://github.com/sghoweri/jquery-mobile/commit/d022248d8bd992908811f6941753e7835ba9ea15 specifically, you'll be able to see the jQM structure widgets I've gotten through my first pass at converting to SASS (nesting and replacing vendor-prefixed rules with Compass mixins, included).

There's still a TON of work to do before I would consider this to be even remotely close to completion:
-Finish re-processing the structure and theme .scss files from the /structure-processing and /theme-processing folders and replacing the CSS in the corresponding /sass/structure and /sass/theme folders
-Comparing the outputted SASS line by line to the original jQM CSS
-Verifying rule specificity
-Converting certain values such as border-radii or colors into global variables
-Converting the theming color variations (and widget states) into Compass color operations
-Documentation
-Adding Compass tasks to Grunt build

... but it's a start. Let me know what you think.

450,2011-09-15 13:48:56,"I like the idea of page event listeners, it's somehow the basic idea around haschange url routing.
It's also the only way to put our code in the right place and have it executed at the right time.

For instance, we may want to perform 'our things' (fetching data from the internet, client side rendering, etc) in the background, before page transitions, in order to speed things up.
However there are certain cases that require the page to be fully shown, because our javascript enhanced widgets (or google maps for that matter) don't work if the dom is hidden or with display:none.
The only way to achieve this behaviour is using page events.

So, I think that the current proposed solution (supporting parameters in the hash part of the url and using page events to access the pageUrl) is enough to play with dynamically generated pages.

Thank you @jblas and @scottjehl.

450,2011-10-20 23:23:42,"@jblas - in jQM, I'd like to use a href like this:



When you click on this link, jQM should:
- make the querystring available somehow in the ""pagebeforeshow"" event
- render #basepage, with the complete url (#basepage?city=a&state=b), so that it is bookmarkable
- update the history, so the back-button works properly
- work on all browsers

The problem I see is inconsistent behavior on different browsers, especially when clicking multiple links with different query strings...

",andyl,jblas
450,2011-10-21 00:49:02,"@andyl: I'm using the same url schema for many applications and it seems to work properly.

I totally agree that using the ""pagechange technique"", as described in the official doc, is quite ""ugly"" since it's nothing but an hack, but I'm **_incredibly grateful**_ to that someone who made this possible, since we've something reliable and officially supported now.

I suggest you develop or use a plugin that implements that ""hack"" in your application, because writing that thing every single time is quite boring.

As for the $.mobile.urlget() function proposed by @IJay, I'm not sure it should be included in the framework, at least not in that way.

The basic problem with jquery mobile is that it lacks an official hash router (cfr: backbone.js and sencha touch) for dynamic pages, although it's quite simple to write one now that hash parameters are supported.
Without a router, every single developer will ""cook"" his own solution, leading to a total mess and that frustration @jblas was talking about.

403,2011-01-23 15:02:53,"@toddparker ok, I just ran some more tests and I think I found new information:

It seems like after swiping the links are executed as **normal links** (no js seems to be executed) causing the browser to perform a normal redirection to the new url.
This also explains why there is no loading dialog after swiping (even when the connection is very slow and the next page takes some time to load).
Could it be that swiping detaches the click handlers somehow? Maybe the hero does not properly fire the necessary 'swipe completed' events? 
Does this info help? If not can you point me to the place in the code where this (swipe events and click event attachment/detachment) is handled so that I could investigate further? Also can you tell me if the click events (or similar) are detached when starting to swipe and attached afterwards?

8299,2015-10-05 17:23:18,"I've worked with @gabrielschulhof on some issues related to `data-url` in the past (see #1383), but there's still a lingering issue here with ampersands and equals (see #3099). Specifically, if a URL query string parameter contains an embedded ampersand or equals sign, then `data-url` is not correctly encoded, and when the URL is updated, the embedded ampersand is interpreted as another parameter, when in fact it should be part of the value for the previous parameter.

I tried to put together this jsbin example showing the error:

http://output.jsbin.com/cononumoze

To use it, just type a string into the box and hit submit. The page will reload and show you the value of various page elements. It's best if you look at this with the Chrome DevTools open to the Network tab. If you enter a query with an ampersand, e.g. `Ren & Stimpy`, when you hit submit, you'll see it get submitted as `/cononumoze?q=ren+%26+stimpy`, which is correct. But when the page reloads, the `data-url` is set as `/cononumoze?q=ren+&+stimpy`, the URL bar is updated without the %26 encoding, and when one tries to parse the `q` parameter, you only get `Ren`. 

It's been a little challenging trying to get my head around this, but I'm pretty sure this is a problem with jQM not properly handling the embedded ampersand/equals. The guidance coming out of #1383 was that `data-url` should NOT be url encoded, and so it goes through a decode pass before being stored. But, I think the embedded ampersand/equals need to stay encoded. I'm not sure how to reliably do this.

This is a pretty critical bug for us, as we legitimately have query parameter values containing ampersands, and basically they are broken for navigation AFTER the original request.

Maybe you can work on these design/style issues: 
- Better hover style for navmenu, quick links (table of contents) menu, and search panel list
- Check if new custom styles have enough contrast on SD/Windows
- New homepage design and content
- Replace the outdated image on the homepage (and on jquerymobile.com)

Then I can continue working on updating demos content and technical issues. Does that work for you?

I think we should change the current rule being modified to 



And in the clear button extension we should add the class `ui-textinput-hide-clear` to the input  when we add a clear button. 

This way if a clear button is added by jqm we hide the native clear. If no clear button is added we leave the default native if available.

7983,2015-03-08 21:07:53,"They are supposed to be as tall as the page, just like ""internal"" panels, so it is a bug. You can see this issue on every device/browser.
With external panels `body` instead of `ui-page` is the containing block. Because we set `height: 99.9%` for `body` it has the height of the viewport, and so has the absolutely positioned panel which we make the same height as its container.
Looking into changing that to `min-height` has not much use since our pages are absolutely positioned as well so the `body` won't get the same height as the page.

@arschmitz - I think we talked about switching to `position: relative;` (and maybe set `absolute` during transitions?) for page at some point. If I remember correctly that had to do with an issue with external toolbars. Only if we make that change we can fix this with CSS. For now only with JS.

7805,2014-10-29 10:53:02,"@arschmitz I was going to suggest to @jackyon building a custom version of jQuery Mobile using the download builder. At that point I discovered a few problems:
1. The swipe events are inside events/touch, so if you wanna build without them, you need to uncheck events/touch, however this leads to the following problems: navigation.js (because of the vclick handler that adds the active button class) depends on vclick, so on events/touch. Thus, attempting to build without swipe will also remove vclick, which basically removes navigation and init. We might want to split swipe out of events/touch and maybe put it into events/swipe - although I haven't checked if swipe uses internal variables also used by other events inside events/touch.
2. navigation.js and pagecontainer depends on events.js, not events/touch, events/throttledresize, and events/navigate individually. Thus, we should also update that dependency, and eventually remove events.js entirely, because it's an empty module.

7478,2015-01-09 18:27:12,"@Ruffio so the bug here I think is what your describing with hash nav when we go back to the initial page we should be removing the hash completely yet it remains matching any subdirectory present ( or file name ).

So a few things here. First there is a warning in the docs i need to double check has not got lost in the move last year that you must always have a trailing `/` on links or else we will treat it as a file. So in the example of `http://www.noscience.dk/git` this is a bad link and so we are treating it as a file not a directory. 

In the case of  `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php#page2` and going to `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php#/gitindex.php` This is because all links are based on the current directory as the base because we need to know about any internal page navigation. Example the actual page loaded in both links is `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php` but the original page is `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php#page2` we need to know that you have navigated to just `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php` because you are not using an id on your original page for your navigation ex `page1` its internal ""id"" ( or data-url ) is `#gitindex.php`.

I hope this has all been clear. If my understanding on the cases here is correct neither of the situations are actually a bug. /cc @gabrielschulhof

The reason we use the label for the button is accessibility related as well. I'd want to check with @dylanb here on other potential issues i'm not thinking of but a work around with this type of styling would be to proxy clicks on the legend to the label. not something we would be likely to do in the lib but maybe a demo.

6965,2014-01-29 18:58:11,"@arschmitz can you weigh in? Please correct me if I'm wrong:

We are planning on being spec-compliant wrt. hash handling so if someone wants to structure their hashes, for example by using what looks like a query string, (`#abc?def=ghi`) then they're gonna have to intervene in the page change process to ensure that the framework loads `#abc` and not `#abc?def=ghi`, right?

I guess when we do this, no extra work will be needed to get `#abc?def=ghi` to show up in the location, whereas now such extra work has to be done, because right now we strip the `?def=ghi` from the location when we set it - which is not to-spec.

So, in conclusion:
- 1.4.0
  1. Clicking `<a href=""#abc?def=ghi"">Go</a>` results in a location of `??????#abc` and in the framework looking for the page with id `abc`.
  2. If you want the resulting location to be `??????#abc?def=ghi` you have to do extra work - for example by assigning ```.jqmData(""url"", ""#abc?def=ghi"") on the destination page.
- 1.5.0 (or later, depending on when we get to it)
  1. Clicking `<a href=""#abc?def=ghi"">Go</a>` results in a location of `??????#abc?def=ghi` and in the framework looking for the page with id `abc?def=ghi`.
  2. If you want the framework to display page `#abc` you have to do extra work - for example by intercepting pagebeforechange and replacing the occurrences of `#abc?def=ghi` in the event data.

The reason why I didn't see the `ui-corner-all` class is because I looked at a navbar where the anchor elements didn't have `data-role=""button""`. This data- attribute is not needed in navbars but adding it shouldn't cause a problem. This has already been fixed by the changes @gabrielschulhof made to buttonMarkup().

- in reflow it doesn't really do anything so we might leave it away, too. Right now it just calls `refresh`

- for both variants, `!create=true`, so both trigger a refresh. 
- inside `addToggles` however, I can now seperate **rebuild** from **refresh** by testing for `!create` (which I named `!keep` ... to make some sense).
- Tests are passing. I will add a test for refreshing a table with new columns, too.

Little bit late, but let's see if we can everything fixed. The `master` code was pretty different from when I did the 1.4 table refresh, so no quick-copy-paste... I updated the current code in master and tried to stick to the suggestions you made on the filter widget. Plus it took me a while to realize that creating a `refresh` or `enhance` method in both `reflow/columntoggle` does not work, because the second one will always overwrite the first...

Anyway. 
- This commit passes the current Qunit tests on my machine.
- I'm now trying to pass the refresh tests I did for 1.4. Will commit asap
- Demo [Reflow](http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/table/reflow.html) and [Toggle](http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/table/toggle.html)
- This should fix:  
  #5856 New refresh method for table widget and extentions (tested)  
  #5839 Table column toggle breaks table priority hiding  (tested)  
  #5880 Refresh method from tables doesn´t update recently added columns (test still missing)  
  #6006 Refresh method on reflow-table duplicate label  (tested)  
  #6129 Table cells not hiding on smaller screen widths when headers and rows are dynamically injected (test still missing)  

I will try to add tests which add columns to confirm, the issues are fixed.

I'm also still wondering about #5630 and will try to take a look at #6121.

Questionable:
#6095 - error if no tbody is specified on a table. The docs say to use a JQM table requires the `tbody` tag to be set, so I would close this.
#6008 - display: table-frow-group makes table hard to center - I'd just recommend wrapping the table in that case

I fixed the tests I did for my previous version. These are all passing on my machine.

Things you could have a look at:
- The controlgroup inside the popup does not enhance correctly. Clueless as to what to do here.
- I have not added tests for dynamically adding/removing columns.
- On refresh, I'm currently re-setting the table to `default`, eg. any toggle locks set by the user when hiding/showing are reset. The alternative would be to display the new rows/columns in the last `state` the table was in = the refreshed table should maintain hidden/shown columns set by the user when toggling. First way is easier to set.
- Destroy still needs to remove the toggle popup
- If the user supplies pre-enhanced markup (`option enhanced`), how to we indentify elements, such as the toggle popup? I'm now using a `option referenceClass` but I hope you have a better idea...

Thanks for reporting the issue.

For 1.4 we are working on reducing the markup we generate for buttons, including the ones in listviews. As a result the anchor element in the list item will get the button classes, including the active state class. This resolves this issue.
It also means we can remove the code that was added (cb54f03) to fix the same issue we had with popups (#4611).

The `ui-btn-active` class is removed when the process of opening the panel is finished, so there is no need to use a timeout here.
The 300ms timeout we use in the popup widget was not part of the fix for #4611, but was added earlier (e612aa8). I am not completely sure why we choose to use a timeout.

Instead of `.children( ""#"" + dataUrl )` we need to use `document.getElementById()`, because that function can handle the weird characters that may be present in the ID, but then we still need to make sure that the returned element is a child of `settings.pageContainer`.

The workaround we should advocate for now is for devs to always add the `data-url` attribute to their dynamically created pages. They need not worry about adding the `data-url` attribute to static pages, because that's added by us upon init.

Thanks for this suggestion. I agree it would be nice if we could leave this up to the developer.

Downside of your solution is that it uses JS to add a class, while we are actually working on reducing this in 1.4 to improve performance. Another problem is the `:not()` selector which isn't supported on IE8. Media queries aren't supported either on IE8, but when people use a polyfill like Respond.js they probably expect things to work.

What I have in mind for field containers is to do the responsiveness the other way around and use class `ui-responsive`, the same way as we do for responsive grids. The labels and form elements sit next to eachother by default and we use the following CSS to stack them at small screens:



Or maybe also `.ui-responsive .ui-field-contain` so you only have to add the `ui-responsive` class to the form container and not each field container in the form.

The rule to apply this at all viewport widths for field containers in popups can be done the same way. That would resolve the problem you described, because you can just omit class `ui-responsive`.
Using an opt-in class and doing it the other way around also makes it a lot easier if you want to use a different breakpoint. Obvious downside is that you have to add that class to your markup if you want things to stay the same as they are now.

Here is a [jsPerf test](http://jsperf.com/delegated-vs-object/4) that shows the difference (thanks @gabrielschulhof for setting up the test!).

What we test here is the processing time; the responsiveness. The test shows that our current code is much faster than the code from your PR.
It's not very likely that there are many close links in a panel, otherwise we should also consider the difference in attaching time. Your code probably results in a faster startup.

Re: a standard way to treat close links. For 1.4/1.5 we are focussing on improving performance and reviewing all widgets. In widgets where we treat close links differently we can look into doing it the same way as we do for panels.
However, performance is not the only thing we have to look at. For example, if the issue you reported couldn't be fixed with a refresh method we should have merged your PR. So there might never be one standard way.

Good point about the next event binding in the `_bindCloseEvents` function in the panel widget. We should look into improving that when we review the panel widget.

5784,2013-03-19 00:50:19,"Hello, All.

I'll try to propose a way of lazy jQM widgets initialization to improve Web App's launching time. I think, @gabrielschulhof told jQM team about my PR last week, so I think you can guess what I'll suggest to you. 
My team's idea is as follows.

If a user makes a jQM javascript file including all of widgets(example: jquery.mobile-1.3.0.js) and adds it on a Web App's HTML page, and a Web browser loads the javascript file, All of jQM widgets' $.widget() methods are compiled and executed first. 
In short, regardless of what widgets are defined on a Web App's HTML page, all widgets are loaded and initialized first. 
All widgets also call the bind method as below, when ""pagecreate"" event is fired,



and then, enhanceWithin method calls enhance method as below and enhance method eventually calls _createWidget method and each widget's _create method. So, all widgets are loaded and initialized first, after a Web browser loads the javascript file.



So, my team thought that we should find what widgets are used on a Web App's HTML page to load and initialize essential jQM widgets. And my team developed some methods and modified some codes in each widget with two processes as follows.
1. My team stored $.widget() method call in a variable, so that JS engine can not call(compile and execute) the $.widget() method.
   
   // Before
   (function( $, undefined ) {
       $.widget( ""mobile.widgetname"", $.mobile.widget, { ... } );
   })( jQuery ); 
   
   // After
   (function( $, undefined ) {
       var widgetRegister = function () { 
                                              $.widget( ""mobile.dialog"", $.mobile.widget, { ... } ) };
       ...
       // Store widget's body method using a new method - addWidgetRegister.
       $.mobile.addWidgetRegister( widgetName, widgetRegister );
   })( jQuery ); 
2. My team updated enhanceWithin method to load and initialize essential widgets on a Web App's HTML page.
   
   // Updated enhanceWithin method
   enhanceWithin: function( target, useKeepNative, selector, widgetName, istarget ) {
       // check what widgets are needed on a Web App.
       var $targets = istarget ? $( target ) :  $( selector, $( target ));
       if ( $targets.length ) {
           ...
           $.mobile[widgetName].prototype.enhance( $targets, useKeepNative );
       }
   }
- Tests : The code has been tested on several jQM widgets using qunit.js.
- Modified code is followed the jQuery Core Style guide.
- Scope : Performance improvement.

When performing a navigate event during startup (such as during a `$( document ).ready( function() {} );` handler, the hash is being set and the history stack is increased before Webkit's initial popstate event happens. Thus, the [conditions](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/64030496e3d13fea0d3c4d24bba1ed8c808f1e14/js/navigation/navigator.js#L185-L194) for ignoring the initial popstate event are no longer met since, at the very least, the length of the history stack is no longer 1.

So, I suspect that this, in turn, causes nav to add an extra item to the history stack which is also a dialogHashKey item, but the stack no longer reflects the state of browser history (because the browser history only has one such item), so, when the user goes back, nav thinks that it can go back another entry to skip past the dialogHashKey states, however, since there is no other entry in the browser history, it ends up going back twice.

I saw that #5466 PR was closed by @gabrielschulhof a few days ago. Thanks so much Gabriel. :)
And there are many lines using jqmData() so my team rechecked them what lines could be changed with get/setAttribute. As a result, the committed codes are the same as #5466.

But some other jqmData method calls return true or false value, so my team thought that it would be better to make a new function including get/setAttribute to handle that case.
@gabrielschulhof, you made getAttrFixed() on buttonMarkup.js, so what do you think that we will define getAttrFixed() in global area and use it in other places? If you agree with my idea, we can upgrade more codes to improve performance.

Because in the custom build the textinput comes after the (range)slider CSS the inputs are broken if the rangeslider is wrapped in a field container.

In addition to @gabrielschulhof his comment...

In previous versions the JS applied those corner classes. For performance we changed this to having the JS only apply the `ui-corner-all` or `ui-btn-corner-all` class. In the CSS we added rules to make child elements inherit the `border-radius` for the applicable corners.

If you used those classes for other elements you have to add them to your custom CSS. Note that you don't need the `-moz` prefixed property anymore. Two examples with the default radius of .6em:

I was thinking of using the dismiss modal here. Meaning, a swipe on page content/toolbars will only close the panel if option dismissible is set to `true` as well. Or do you think it's better to keep it simple and make a swipe on content/toolbars always close the panel as long as option `swipeClose` is `true`?

One of the advantages would be that you can hide the dismiss modal on larger (desktop) screens with a media query. Because our swipe event also works with mouse, text selection for example triggers swipe.

Also, should we make an exception for overlay mode, since the content/toolbars stay in place?

All labels are aligned with the top of the form element. I think this is a matter of personal preference.

If we would want to change this we run into the following issues:
- We don't know if the label is next to a mini sized element or not
- Labels have font-size 16px while text inputs have font-size 14px and mini sized form buttons 12.5px
- Vertical alignment of text in form elements can be different across browsers

I think we should leave it up to the developer to align the label differently with custom CSS and close this ticket as won't fix.

One more note on link bindings.

I've talked with @gabrielschulhof about this but we can pretty easily setup `$.mobile.navigate` to pass arguments through when it triggers the navigate event so we can remove the `$.mobile.changePage` calls from our link bindings and make them an optional module.

Obviously that has implications for the ""fetch links"" in that they would just be links with a simple binding to trigger a navigate with some special options possibly.

5387,2013-01-05 21:16:16,"This may actually be a bug in jQuery core. We call $form.serialize() to acquire all the form data, and jQuery filters `<input type=""submit"" name=""theName"" value=""theValue></input>` out of the form data. Now, this may be intentional, because inputs of type submit are not part of the form data unless clicked. So, we may have to manually add the clicked input of type submit to the form data in addition to calling serialize.

The reason it works with a jQM-enhanced button is that jQM temporarily replaces the button with an input of type hidden, but only when it's clicked.

We need to ascertain, likely with the help of @dmethvin whether my above thinking is indeed the reason for the absence of ""submit"" from the list of input types serialized during $.fn.serialize().

The issue happens because `data-rel=""back""` is missing in the link of the large cancel button in @jerone his fiddle. See ""Closing dialogs"" here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dialog/index.html

The back button on pageTwo is dynamically created. When you don't use `data-rel=""back""` on the link that brings you back from dialogThree (which is also a page) to pageTwo it adds an item to the history stack. That's why the back button on pageTwo then requires two clicks to actually bring you back to pageOne.
The active state is removed from a (back) button on the `pagehide` event. On the first click you stay on the same page, so this event doesn't fire and the button keeps the active state.

I added `data-rel=""back""` and then everything works as expected: http://jsfiddle.net/jEesE/6/

Test case: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/listviews/listview-filter-autocomplete.html

Steps to reproduce: Enter first 3 characters of a city name. Click on the clear button or view source button.
Because the ""change"" event is fired after you blur the input, the first click on one of those buttons triggers that event. Only after you click a second time the input field will be cleared or source view popup will be opened.
However, if we wouldn't bind to ""change"" the list wouldn't be updated when you click on the clear button.

[Now](a743616) we also bind to the ""input"" event to fix problems with multibyte characters (e.g. Japanese), the problem became a bit worse.  When you enter a character both ""keyup"" and ""input"" fire and in the test case this means two Ajax calls. I don't think the ""input"" event is supported by all browsers that we support, so we can't just drop ""keyup"".

Regarding pasting text which @arschmitz mentioned: Maybe we can resolve this by binding to ""paste"" and ""cut"" events, but again browser support might be a problem. And we would still need ""change"" to update the list when the clear button is clicked, unless we make this trigger a ""clear"" event or something.

I have updated my demo to the latest JQM (new page: [here](http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/tableview/demo.html) and pushed the commented code to my [tableview repo](https://github.com/frequent/tableview)).

This version is close to the version I'm currently using (with datatables). I have changed the custom select to native selects on my site, but for the new demo I changed native selects to popup, so you the widget now uses popup for the column toggles by default. I also JQM gridded the top and bottom wrappers.

There is a bunch of stuff in tableview which you probably don't need/want (filling the wrapper slots, auto adding a selectable-checkbox-column ...). I have labelled the js/css in the code, so you can just pick what you like. 

The tricky stuff also should more or less work - tricky being responsive columns with `multi-row table headers` (more than two will be too difficult to toggle) and table header cells usually having `non-JQM classes` in which case the original responsive example doesn't work.

What I haven't added yet is a wrapper-div around the table and slot elements. Without this, the plugin will run into trouble if  more than one tableview is in the DOM. I also still need to add the code for the select (vs popup) toggle menu and get the zebra function to work (odd/even theming table rows).

ok. My 2cents: 
- I wouldn't close the popup after every check. I had used custom selects before switching to native selects and I sorely miss configuring the table in one step and not having to select over and over to get the layout I want. 
- prio 1-6 does seem like a lot. Unless you are aming for webTV.
- nice idea with the `abbr`
- curious to see what users say regarding theming options. The way I'm reading it now, you are stressing to keep the table ""bare"", but also provide a ton of classes to manually style the table. I kind of like the JQM way = data-theme=""done"". Adding classes for borders, backgrounds, et all manually does seem a little complicated compared to other widgets, don't you think?

@MauriceG and I already had a nice discussion about making it possible to set a default icon for listviews. See #4582.

I think we should keep things simple for users and not add new options if not really necessary. So I suggest to stick to one option ""icon"" with the following possibilities:

default = ""arrow-r""
1. [global] override the default for all listviews by using the `$.mobile` object
2. [UL/OL] override the default or global with `data-icon` on a listview _OR_ with the option `icon` if that listview is created programmatically
3. [LI] override any of the above for a list item with `data-icon` on that specific list item

This could be done with the following additions / changes:

5009,2012-09-15 07:37:52,"@kvedananda - This is indeed something we want to improve. See the thread of #4469 for work arounds.

@toddparker - Is applying the active state to all buttons, regardless of markup, something we can add for 1.3?
",jaspermdegroot,toddparker
5009,2012-11-26 11:56:55,"After a discussion with @uGoMobi we've come up with two possible solutions for adding active states to those buttons (be they links or form elements) that will cause the browser to tear down all of jQM as it shows a page via an HTTP request.
1. The CSS-based approach: We create a new class (ui-btn-active-remove - naming is up for discussion, of course) that is a CSS transition which basically negates the modifications introduced by ui-btn-active, but does so after a while. We apply this class during nav's click handler, when we determine that following the link would result in HTTP navigation. A central sumbit handler similar to the click handler might have to be added so we can also deal with form buttons that have had ui-btn-active added to them. We identified several consequences with this approach:
   1. The source page might become littered with applications of the class ui-btn-active-remove if the user repeatedly navigates over HTTP, then returns to the jQM page containing the HTTP links. The presence of these classes would have no visual effect, but it would be ""unsightly"". We could clean up during the click handler with a $( "".ui-btn-active-remove"" ).removeClass( ""ui-btn-active-remove"" ) if that turns out not to be expensive. For browsers that do not support CSS transitions, the application of ui-btn-active-remove would have the effect of immediately removing the modifications applied by ui-btn-active, so for those browsers [this issue](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5009) would not be fixed.
   2. There might be bugs similar to the problems that prompted introduction of popup interruptible transitions. For example, there is a (Chrome) browser bug that was not filed whereby, when clicking an AJAX link from a popup that leads to another page and later returning to the page containing the popup, one would see the final stages of the popup's closing transition on the source page, even though the time interval during which the closing transition was supposed to complete is much shorter than the time spent on the page opened from the popup.
   3. The class ui-btn-active-remove might have to be themed, and we'll have to apply one of ui-btn-active-remove-[a-z] at the time of vclick.
   
   _This approach hinges on the fact that we can essentially achieve the effect of removing .ui-btn-active by adding the class .ui-btn-active-remove and, furthermore, defining ui-btn-active-remove in such a way that, where browsers support CSS transitions, the transition is used to achieve the effect of removing ui-btn-active, and where browsers do not support CSS-transitions, the basic properties of the ui-btn-active-remove class will have the effect of removing ui-btn-active._ @Wilto should be able to weigh in here.
2. The [unload](http://api.jquery.com/unload)-based approach (as @jerone suggested): During the central click routing in jquery.mobile.navigation.js we make the determination as to whether we should handle a link via AJAX or whether we should let the browser handle it the normal way. At this point, if the decision is to let the browser handle it, we could add a one-shot unload handler that would remove the active state added during the central vclick handler the same way as the hashchange handler would remove such an active state. We might also have to introduce a central submit handler so as to add this one-shot unload handler for submit buttons as well.
   
   The challenge with this approach is that we must test that the unload event works reliably on all our supported platforms.

Thanks for reporting the issue. I noticed the same problem in other situations. My conclusion is that this is caused by a change in the way Chrome rounds off when calculating the size of an element where `em` values are used for padding or margin.

On your screenshot the height of div ui-btn-inner is 83px but when you look at ""metrics"" you'll see a value of 82.36666870117188 which becomes 83px. If you change the top/bottom padding of the nested div ui-link-inherit from .7em to 12px (0.7 \* 16px = 11.2 --> 12px) the height is exactly 84px and the problem is gone.

So Chrome only rounds off the total height. Still it would make more sense to me if the unrounded total height would have been 82.4. Maybe the change is not intentional but a bug.

The issue is also visible where we use negative margin, like with ui-listview: http://jsbin.com/atahip/29. The border of the last field container isn't visible.

This still isn't working....in Firefox the URL displayed in the address bar is still displaying decoded and missing the hash (#)...so when you refresh on the URL, the page doesn't reload. 

There were still a handful of places that were using the location.hash.

I see there is a a second ""new"" way to work around this issue that was implemented, but I don't think its fully solving this problem and I don't quite understand why.

Going back to an earlier post....I got this working myself in the 1.1.1 release by simply just changing **everywhere** that `location.hash` was being **read** with `$.mobile.path.parseUrl( location.href ).hash`

I also went through the stable 1.1.1 release and changed every  `location.hash`, `$.mobile.path.parseLocation().hash` and `path.parseLocation().hash` with `$.mobile.path.parseUrl( location.href ).hash` and its working for me.

Since it's not possible to chain popups, I think this is a not supported ""construct"".

As of 1.2 non-native-selects are popups and when using a native select for the first select-item in your code, your demo works fine.

Hi, the fix does not work for me because I need to skip the filtering after I injected new data items in the list (I used to change the 'lastval' variable from outside the class but I realize that was an ugly hack so I changed your code a little bit and now it work find and it's clean (I hope) :



Let me explain the modifications: 
first I do need to know what is the value of the input text so I added two parameters to the event you created
(if I don't have this value I can't fill the list with my custom item values)
then when I fill the list with new items (all items are removed then new ones are added) : it means that they don't need to be filtered after.

in my event catch function I call event.preventDefault(); which means skip filtering;



note about filtering : 
why do I added code to chane  val and lastval variables?:
if I don't set val and lastval to """" then a search with accends won't work (exemple : enter ""côte"" the 'ô' would be filtered but I want it to be considered as a regular 'o')

I hope you understand my issues because it's not very easy for me to explain. ;)

4678,2012-07-12 07:06:42,"@MauriceG Hi Maurice, yes this was a comment related to your 12 PRs for changing scheme to theme, not just specific to this one in particular. Setting the theme will apply a color scheme (i.e. colors that work together, including background color, widget color(s) and text color), so that's why I was saying I think color scheme can be ok. In the case of overlay theme for popup or dialog, then we are talking about just the one color, so maybe scheme is not appropriate. This is a very specific point, and this is why I would like @toddparker 's opinion. Also, throughout the docs we have used swatch, swatch or theme, but never ""color theme"". So that's why I am not in favor of ""color theme"". It will be applied to these docs and also the api docs and I want to make sure we make the right decision here, so that it doesn't get changed more than once. So hopefully we can resolve this today.

Thanks for reporting the issue.

The cause of this is that the bottom border is only added to the last item of the list by using the :last-child pseudo class selector. That doesn't distinguish hidden and visible elements. So you only see the bottom border in that example when ""Volvo"" is in view, because that is the last item in the original list.

Older browsers like IE7 and IE8 don't support the :last-child selector, so on those you will never see a border at the bottom of the list.

I have been thinking about the footer as well. That certainly qualifies as ""subtle"". Downside is that you might find out you have been reading the wrong information only after you reached the bottom of the page.

Something I have been thinking about is adding (small) breadcrumbs at the top of the content div and add the version to the first crumb. For example:

Docs 1.1.1. > Pages > Dialogs

That might also improve the search results on Google. That's another issue mentioned at #3330. Probably best would be if the title contains the version, but I think that would mean we have to hardcode it :(

I'm just thinking, can we actually make changes to built & deployed docs? (or does it mean @johnbender will need to rebuild/redeploy?)

What I was thinking initially with this one was some sort of warning, maybe as a popup or a dialog, warning the user that the version they were viewing was not the latest one, with 2 option in the dialog: ok, take me to the latest version or no, I understand the risk (kind of thing).

4595,2012-06-25 20:15:58,"@uGoMobi  - I think this is because the custom select triggers a hashchange when (opening/)closing, which is not blocked (ignoreNextHashchange is only ""un-set"" when the dialog closes... I assume) and therefore the hashchange is passing through $.mobile.changePage landing at the ""no to defined"" option, which loads the first page.

As a workaround I'm setting flags whenever a popup/custom select or in page dialog is open to preventDefault() hashchanges being triggered from closing elements.

I also asked @gabrielschulhof  about adding a role to the data.options passed along with every hashChange event. If there was 



Then it would be easy to check the incoming hashChange event data for the role and block falsely triggered backwards transitions. Maybe the role can replace ignoreNextHashChange altogether as a global setter. 
",frequent,gabrielschulhof
4595,2012-07-05 10:31:03,"The fundamental issue is that, given the navigational sequence below,



... where `*[]*` indicates the page currently being viewed and where ""page loaded without hash change"" means ""page loaded with `$.mobile.changePage( url, { changeHash: false } )`""

when the dialog issues `window.history.back()` upon close, the hash given to `_handleHashChange` will be that of the last page loaded normally (i.e., with hash change - enclosed in `[ # # ]` in the diagram above). This will cause that page to be displayed.

This is incorrect. The page that should be displayed is, of course, the last page that was loaded without hash change (enclosed in `[ |  | ]` in the diagram above).

To achieve this, we need to
1. Record the value of changeHash in each urlHistory entry

and 

2 a. Create a navigation policy such that changeHash: false entries are to some extent ""children"" of the last known changeHash: true entry, and it is the last child that will be switched to upon `window.history.back()`

xor

2 b. Modify the dialog's and the popup's close method to behave similarly to the `$.mobile.hashListeningEnabled = false` case in that they do not call `window.history.back()`, but instead they call some new function within the navigation that performs the jqm equivalent of `window.history.back()` without an actual hashchange.

BB Bold

Android 2.3 - Samsung S2
Opera Mobile (tested a few devices on simulator)
Safari desktop (on Windows)
Chrome (Linux and Windows)
Firefox (Linux and Windows)

There is an issue with Opera desktop with 33.333% width - there is a big gap. That is already there with current code and I don't think we can fix that.

Would it make sense to add a **role=""popup""** inside the data-options object when the popup transitions fire? Similar to dialogs, where I can say: 

  if (  data.options.role == ""dialog""  ) { do nothing }

Otherwise it's really difficult to capture the closing hashchange (which in my case runs awol in my own nav-layer). Dialogs I can easily block by checking for role, popups .... are stealthy  :-) 
",frequent,gabrielschulhof
4507,2012-06-09 18:55:55,"I guess this would need some work. The dialog styles probably don't apply correctly when it's inside a popup, and as it stands, the div stored in the variable named `dialog` you attach to the DOM at `$(document.body).append(dialog);` has display set to none, so the popup will calculate its size as 0✕0. However, even if you add `dialog.css(""display"", ""block"")` it still doesn't work correctly, because the popup still calculates its size as 0✕0.

Basically, we need to figure out whether we want to support turning dialogs into popups. However, if all you want is a popup that looks like a dialog, then there are several examples in the docs. If you generate the DOM structure at runtime, I suggest you make it look like one of the examples before calling popup on it. That should work.

@toddparker, do you think we should add formal support for displaying a dialog as a popup? i.e., calling popup() on an element that has previously had dialog() called on it?
",gabrielschulhof,toddparker
4503,2012-06-09 19:55:51,"That's a good point - header-inside-a-popup should work. It's probably a matter of widening the scope of the CSS selector for header, but @Wilto probably knows better.

4502,2012-06-08 14:56:20,"@frequent not, it seems, if you include js/, however, that may just be because js/index.php has the inclusions defined in the right order.

This may be a problem with the dependencies introduced recently. @gseguin needs to check whether any combination of requirements can result in an inclusion order where the pushState handler is registered before the vanilla hashchange handler.

OTOH, this may simply be a bug in `$.testHelper.asyncLoad` ...

I've tried to make pushstate depend on init, but that didn't fix the problem.

Maybe I have been a little too hasty closing, since it is seen on Apple's SDK.

Sadly the first one is the only one we can't put in the framework CSS. Like Todd said, people can set the radius to anything they like and this would override their setting. If you want fully rounded buttons you can add it as a workaround to your custom CSS.

@toddparker - If you agree, I like to leave this is issue open with low priority label. Maybe I think of another solution that we can include in the framework CSS.

I did a quick profile over the weekend of lists-performance.html on my iPad. You can browse the results here:

The biggest offender with 5 seconds seems to be related to a blur() call results in a pattern of calls involving fn.init and fn.removeClass ... I didn't count the number of times the pattern repeated but I would hazzard to guess that it's doing it for each item in the listview.

4340,2012-06-21 23:32:35,"Alight @scottjehl figured out the root of the issue here. In 1.0, we first scrolled to the top of the page before starting a transition. In 1.1, we wanted to avoid this jump so we now fade the page out first by default. As it turns out, devices like an iPhone seem to keep the page above your scroll position in memory when doing a transition, but not the part of the page below.

So if you're on a long, complex page like the listview performance page with 500 items, clicking the first list item will work pretty well, but one halfway down will be very slow and a bottom one will crash the browser. Why? Because the browser is trying to animate a really massively tall page when scrolled down due to how it handle things. Test here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-performance.html

As a test, we added another condition to say that if you're either coming or going to a page where the scroll position is 3x the height of the device's screen, skip the transition. This makes the navigation back to it's snappy self. You'll notice we're using scroll position, not screen height here because I can navigate to a 10,000 pixel tall page fine but if I need to navigate away from that same page when scrolled down (or nav back to this with a scroll position restored), it will need way more memory to run the transition and could be slow or fail.

This 3x value is just a starting point, we can use whatever criteria we want. Here is the change to line 28 in jquery.mobile.transition.js to give this a spin:

`none = !$.support.cssTransitions || maxTransitionOverride || !name || name === ""none"" || Math.max( $( window ).scrollTop(), toScroll ) > screenHeight * 3,`

The question is how to layer this in. Do we just pick a value for this for 1.1.1 as a safely valve for performance now, then expose a config option for 1.2 to set the criteria? This is parallel to `maxTransitionOverride` - this sets the screen width that shuts off transitions automatically, this new one is like ```maxTransitionScrollOverride''' where we nix transitions based on vertical scroll position. Naming could be cleaned up to make this clearer.

@gseguin or @johnbender - do you want to give this a look and think about how we should get this in?

4329,2012-05-16 12:24:43,"The stuff I talked about on IRC was mostly for @johnbender ... It stems from the following:

It turns out that doing a stack has almost exactly the same code as doing mutually exclusive popups. The only additional thing one needs to do is to ensure that whichever popup is the last one to have been opened ends up on top of all the other already-open popups.

This means that we need to keep track of the z-index values of each screen that is open, and each popup container. This is pretty simple, since we're already storing the already-open popups in a list. We just keep the max value of each of the two (screen and container) z-index values around, and give each new popup the max plus one.

What I was telling @johnbender was that this popup manager can be extended to handle things other than popups as well - i.e., all in-page-navigation can be handled via one of these managers.

Because you do not set any theme on any container (page or content), the default theme is **c**.
The Buttons inherit that c-theme so they are white on startup.
When changing the theme to **a**, the buttons have to be **black**. 
The workaround raises an error: _cannot call methods on button prior to initialization_ and the hover ""animation"" is lost.
This may because you call refresh on the surrounding div, not the button input itself.

Seems to me that the option to set updatePagePadding to false becomes useless when it only sometimes applies.
This would mean that when a page is shown using a transition there is no padding, but when the user refreshes the page or enters the site on that page, there will be padding.

I suggest to pull @MauriceG his PR that fixes this.

@scottjehl can you confirm?
",jaspermdegroot,MauriceG
4223,2012-06-14 09:47:46,"At first I thought the idea behind the option to set this to false, was to make it possible to set padding yourself and don't have it overridden by the framework. For instance when you want content on the exact same height no matter the height of the header. Scott's explanation about it being an ""update"" and not a ""set"" function makes sense though.

The padding is already set in the css (see also related issue #4412). Changing it to a ""setPagePadding"" function requires an explanation in the docs that you have to override those rules with custom css if you set it to false.
If anyone wants this to be changed we need a PR that cover all those aspects.

I would like to reflect the updated page by changing the hashtag, but I can't because all deeplinks to this page ala **some.html#new_content** will break, because the page isn't there and I'm missing an event to tap into the first page being loaded to redirect to the actual page and fire an Ajax call to update the content.

No problem on the 2nd page with _pagebeforechange_, but on the first page, this does not fire, does it?

If I could do:

I am still thinking about a good fallback for IE7. Question: can you take a look at the test page on a Windows Phone device? I can't test WP myself and it would be good to know if IE7 is the only problem I have to deal with.

I have more or less tracked this down to the **pushStateHandler** and the **onPopState** function. 

Disable the function call and you have no more trailing _hashchange_ events. 

I figure as _hashchange_ fires with URL changes and popState changes the URL after the actual changepage and transition, this could be a reason for an additional hashchange firing when popstate is modifying the URL. I guess it's a timing issue, because sometimes it triggers (popstate too late), sometimes it doesn't (popstate in time). The JQM 1.0. version used a setTimeout here. 

Trying to narrow it down.

4094,2012-04-26 21:09:36,"@gseguin 

Ok. I think I have it:

**Problem 1** = _fromHash_ and _toHash_ are always empty strings
This may be my faulty setup, but in the _hashValueAfterReset_ function this line



always returns empty strings for me. In case the urlHistory has an entry with url like #somePage, I'd expect it to return #somePage and not """". Not sure how to fix this.

**Problem 2** = the order inside if (popState) {... } seems wrong. 
In the current way it's set up, browser hashchanges can always pass, because:



To fix this, I re-shuffled like this (and manually set _hashChanged_ to true): 



it works for me. I only get a single call to **_handleHashChange** and thus a single changePage only. 

I'm not sure whether the browser or popstate induced hashChange should handle the transition. The way I set it up, it will be the popstate that triggers the hashchange. If that's it, I'd be happy to (try my hands on a ) pull request.

4003,2012-04-11 11:18:10,"not sure if this is an issue.

I'm trying to find my way around with the new fixed-toolbars as per the docs.

Reproduce:
- Go to the docs page  http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0-rc.2/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html
- Firebug-shrink the page-height to below screen-height e.g. by setting  **page min-height: ...px** to **height: ...px** 
- The fixed footer will no longer slide-out and hide. 
- Instead it will jump up to mid screen.

I guess it's kind of an odd case having a page with page-height < screen-height AND using fixed toolbars, but I guess it might happen nevertheless (I'm thinking templates for headers and footers used across an app).

@johnbender 
I filed a similar issue with the old fixed toolbar - #3050 pull request, issue #2646. Back then the issue was setting CSS top: 0 when hiding the footer. This moves the footer to the end of the page. When the page is longer than the screen, the footer is hidden out of view. However, if the page ends mid screen, the footer will jump up to the middle of the screen.

Maybe this helps. If it's an issue after all.

But I did find the simple demo I made to reproduce the issue without jQM at all. The buttons in the footer can be clicked once to scroll the page, then they'll be unclickable. The focus/target area of the buttons actually leave the button boundaries!

http://jsbin.com/iredok

The only way to restore it that I could find is to interact with the page - toggling page display didn't seem to help, and neither does toggling style to trigger a reflow, like tweaking the padding on the page to something large, then removing it again.

The problem is not just in Android - it's iOS5 too! It's only an issue with programmatically scrolling the page - user scrolling doesn't cause any problems that I can see. It only seems to affect real form controls, like input, button, select, etc - anchor buttons seem to be fine.

One last oddity: double-tapping the buttons works in iOS5. I'm not sure why. 

Given that this is not our bug, I think the best we can do is document it so people know not to do it: ""If you're using form controls inside fixed headers, do not programmatically scroll the window."" 

We should also avoid in-page scrolling in our own components: for example, we were considering scrolling the page programatically when collapsibles are expanded, but that'll potentially introduce this bug.

3863,2012-03-20 19:21:20,"My current jQM project has two ""notext"" link buttons side-by-side in a fixed header bar. This wasn't a problem in 1.0.1, but the true fixed positioning in 1.1 has lead to a problem in the Android 2.2 browser. The first of the two buttons is usable, but the second one gets its active state triggered without actually causing navigation to the new page.
- Bug demo: http://jsbin.com/eyufam/148
- Same, without fixed-position header: http://jsbin.com/eyufam/149
- Corrected using new CSS: http://jsbin.com/eyufam/147

My fix works by eliminating all relative or absolute positioning in the buttons and hiding the button text with a modified version of the ""font crunch"" approach [used in the HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/commit/aa0396eae757c9e03dda4e463fb0d4db5a5f82d7) and discussed in jQM issue #3851.

So far I've tested the fix in these browsers:
- FF 11
- Mobile FF 10.0.3
- current Chrome for Android beta
- Opera Mobile 12
- Opera Mini 6.5.27452
- Android Browser 2.2
- Android Browser 2.3.3
- HTC's version of Android Browser 2.3.5
- Android Browser 4.0

3792,2012-03-11 14:48:30,"I just upgraded our test Playbook running 2.0 and noticed that both checkboxes and radiobuttons are broken on this platform.

Go here:
http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/checkboxes/
http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/radiobuttons/

On PB2, the checkbox and radio icon is missing so these just look like buttons. Tapping either will show the down state but since there's no icon, you don't get visual feedback. Interestingly, the horizontal check/radios look and work ok. This is probably because these don't show the icon on the left and flip to ui-state-active when tapped so these are pretty different.

First, thanks for the fiddle. It's rare and always appreciated.

In general we support this type of activity through refresh methods triggered through the plugin system:



The update layout is meant, I think, mostly for you to bind to to know when you should update custom widgets or components in the page. Not as a mechanism for telling our components to update. Though I can sympathize with the confusion.

To support this we'd have to add a refresh or collapse method to the widget and that's not likely to happen before 1.1 final.

Sorry, I need to repost this. I think I have narrowed #3645 down to what's wrong.

I used your fiddle from #3645. This is the new fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/hDGVZ/3/

The problem is, you cannot trigger an event on the first page being loaded using on(). Doesn't work with pageID or div.jqmData(role=""page"").

If I do this using live() instead, I can set a listener for the the first page on both #pageID or div:jqmData(role=""page""). Both fire as expected when the page loads. Using on() on the first page however does nothing.

Hey Scott,

Is there any other way we can try to prevent the location bar from dropping? IMO we shouldn't be outright changing hrefs for links for exactly the reason this bug is about ... we don't know what developers are going to be doing in the events/notifications triggered by the framework processing of the link.
",jblas,toddparker
3686,2012-03-09 17:41:44,"I'm unsure there is.

Before implementing this, I did several isolated tests and found that changing the href to a hash-based value was the only way to prevent it, short of handling touch events that is.

I agree though, what we're doing here is not ideal, and potentially problematic for developers. Not sure what to recommend, since the virtual/touch events can't be trusted entirely for navigation...

3602,2012-11-26 13:25:03,"I think we may have no choice but to keep the init event around because we've been telling people to bind to it in order to make sure that the page is loaded and enhanced. pagecreate is not good for us, because a lot of our widgets bind to pagecreate to initiate enhancement of the page. So, if the script for those widgets is loaded asynchronously along with some code for hooking up to things once the page has been enhanced for sure, then we'll have load order issues. That's one of the reasons we need the second (init) event.

In short:

pagecreate - enhance page now
pageinit - the page is loaded and enhanced (meaning the DOM won't change anymore), and ready for your event hookups.

3558,2012-02-28 14:11:02,"Hi @toddparker, @Wilto,

I have some additional idea how to disable link button in IE. We can render link buttons in ‘buttons’ plugin instead of ‘buttonmarkup’ plugin. In this case we can use disable() and enable() functions for link buttons the same way as for general buttons. All we need is to add [data-role=’button’] to ‘buttons’ plugin initSelector and remove ‘:jqmData(role='button')’ from ‘buttonmarkup’ plugin initSelectior. It works for IE8/9. In this case we will have 'disabled' attribute and also 'ui-disabled' css class. 'disabled'  attribute will make the trick to make link unclickable for IE8/9. Unfortunately I found out that this approach doesn’t work for IE7 because it ignores ‘disabled’ attribute and link stays clickable. As a possible workaround we can temporary rename ‘href’ attribute in disabled() func to ‘hrefTemp’ and set it again in enable() func.

I think this just transplanted the issue that jQuery had up into our code. The problem with swallowing the exception is that it's the same as not calling focus at all in IE. If we remove the focus call altogether then it doesn't much matter but if the focus call is important then we need to move the focus call to the point at which the element is visible.

@toddparker 

Can you comment on how important that focus is? (We focus the title on page load I believe)

So it the screen is small (iPhone portrait), it's width is 100%, the label goes on a separate line, and there is enough space to display everything.
In Landscape mode, it's width is 60%, so while it looks like there is still plenty of space to display the final element, actually the div is too small. To view this effect, go to http://www.visutech.net/jQuery-hor-radios/test.html and slowly reduce the size of the screen.

I'll mostly defer to @gseguin on this, but your interest is greatly appreciated given your obvious familiarity with the subject matter!

Our primary goal, before even beginning with AMD, was to create a download builder so that people could slim down the library where possible. We obviously needed to determine dependencies and using AMD to do that resolution was a clear win over doing something custom (note: the deps themselves are still a work in process). The use of it in the docs and tests is just a happy coincidence that lets devs discard php while working on the library. 

The decision to use pragmas came after attempting to using sed in our build process which turned out to be clunky. We also wanted any reference to AMD to be discarded in our builds since we aren't really using it to define modules, just for dependencies. 

All that said, we are considering leveraging AMD in a more traditional manner (which I'm relatively ignorant of) by doing things  like you've mentioned and possible defining module exports.

Hopefully that gives you some insight into our motivation and why our AMD implementation looks rather stunted :D
",johnbender,gseguin
3386,2012-01-05 21:43:21,"@johnbender that makes sense, I know of some libraries that just use AMD-style internally for this kind of thing and do not use it once the file is built. That is a great use for it, and I think what I mentioned above would fit that style and reduce some line noise in the source. But I'll wait for @gseguin to comment on it.

We can disable the event for one of those cases (url or object) or add a new event for one of them (`pageafterloadbeforechangezomgwtfbbq`?).

Q1

I agree it would be nice to have a `data-*` attribute for the option but putting it on the link itself seems odd in the same way that designating the page loaded should be a dialog is odd. In the case of `data-rel=dialog` the convenience is such a massive win that any weirdness and difficulty in implementation is forgotten. Otherwise we might end up with a bunch of dialog specific data attributes on the link. 

I think we should make it a page/dialog data attribute option. The only people we're pleasing by putting the data attribute on the link is the intersection of the set of people who don't know whether the linked page should be a dialog or a page at design time and the set of people who want to alter the default bottom corner behavior (small set of folks imo).

@toddparker can/should this be off by default?

Q2

The data attributes should be available in the `this.options` object in the dialog widget. If we go the above route that should be a non-issue.

So anyway, in createVirtualEvent it looks like that code was copied from UI and I am still not clear on the comment there about ""fixing"" the event multiple times. The jQuery.event.fix method is intended to normalize a browser event into a jQuery.Event object. Once you have a jQuery.Event object there shouldn't be a need to fix it again, since the event has already been normalized to the best of jQuery's ability. You can just copy over all of its properties. I recall talking to @scottgonzalez about using jQuery.extend for this but can't recall if there were specific issues that prevented it.

Most likely this is pointing towards a need for something like the ability for jQuery.Event to accept an existing Event object and copy its properties, because we definitely shouldn't have UI and Mobile doing a copy-pasta on parts of jQuery.event.fix.

1. baseTagTest() as implemented in 1.0 is not returning the correct support value in the case the document contains an existing <base> tag.
2. baseTagTest() as implemented in 1.0 does not test the actually dynamic change of the base tag in the case the document contains an existing <base> tag.
3. getClosestBaseUrl() assumes that the data-url path for a given page is the base when in-fact it may not be.
4. External documents that are loaded as pages can contain a base tag that uses a _DIFFERENT_ path from the application document that loaded it with AJAX.

The baseTagTest() re-write I posted a few comments back addresses both #1 and #2.

@jguyomard attempted to fix #3 by forcing the URL to be used to be the base if $.support.dynamicBaseTag was true, but the fix assumes that all external documents will have the same base, when in fact they won't, especially in the case where no base tag is ever used, but the platform/device actually supports dynamicBaseTag.

#4 is a known issue. We don't support the loading of external pages that specify their own <base> tag, which I hope to fix during the 1.x timeframe. I believe there is an actual issue already reported about it.

I think a better interim fix for #3, until we can add support for #4, is to modify getClosestBaseUrl() to do this check:



That way we can get the case where the application document contains a <base> and the external pages don't, working.

The alternative, would be to assume that all external documents pulled in are assumed to have the exact same <base> path which I think @jguyomard was thinking and instead check:

The version of JQM we're running is after the @Wilto version. We're running the official JQM 1.0 final release.  ""Out of the box"" , JQM 1.0 final was setting aria-hidden=true on all lists.

We changed the JQM 1.0 final code (line 6192 in version 1.0) in our local copy to now read...

buttonInner.setAttribute(""aria-hidden"", ""false"");

and now lists in our local copy of JQM work with ARIA / Voiceover.

I've attached a screen shot of a section of your code changes. I highlighted in gray the field value in question. In our version, we changed ""true"" to ""false"" to prevent ARIA from hiding the buttons / lists.

3154,2011-11-23 19:33:12,"As of jQuery Mobile 1.0, the entire markup within a page is scanned for elements to be enhanced. This is problematic for 3rd party widgets/libraries that don't want anybody enhancing their markup or attaching behavior. We need some data-\* attribute that we can place on an element container that tells the framework not to enhance anything inside it.

There is a potential performance problem here since this means all components that do enhancement must first look up the ancestor hierarchy to see if the element they are about to enhance falls under one of these special containers. @toddparker and I were discussing this and he suggested that perhaps we only pay this cost if a configuration flag is turned on ... that is support for this special attribute would only be available if the user knowingly turned it on and was willing to pay the price. When implementing this feature, keep in mind that we may want to avoid using $.fn.closest() and instead crawl the ancestor hierarchy manually since it is much faster.
",jblas,toddparker
3154,2012-02-17 20:18:25,"@toddparker @jblas 

So I stopped to think about making this alteration to the various `$.fn` plugins. In the same way it doesn't  make sense (to me at least) to just exclude elements from widget enhancement implicitly by adding logic to our `_createWidget` decoration, it doesn't make sense for someone to call `$(""foo"").controlgroup()` and only have some of the elements enhance without an obvious reason why.

Instead I've added `$.fn.jqmEnhanceable` (open to naming suggestions) as a collection pruning method so that wherever these fluent helpers are called it will be obvious where to look for the exclusion logic. 



I'm going under the assumption that I should add these to all the callsites of all the plugins internally because these data-enhance false containers could live inside widget markup that might contain something that requires `buttonMarkup`.

http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-search-filtertext.html

You should file a new issue for the filter event request.  Alternatively, you could have a high frequency timer checking whether you have text in the filter input and any listview items that match `$(""#mylist"").children(""li.ui-screen-hidden"")`.  If you don't want to use a timer, you could bind it to the `change` and `keyup` events on the filter input, but then you'd have to make sure the jQM filtering was complete before you ran the check.

On forcing the filter to be reapplied: I haven't tested this, but I'm pretty sure you can just trigger the `change` event on the filter input after you add items, since jQM's filtering function is bound to the `change` and `keyup` events.

A couple of options here:
- Block the click handler when a change page is in progress. Note we already track this and queue any requests, which is what happens here.
- Throw an overlay over the entire content to catch any clicks.

Option 1 above would require us to catch the click and basically kill it (preventDefault and stopPropagation) because we don't want the 2nd click to actually cause the browser to navigate.

Option 2 may have some rendering implications on slower platforms that think they need to repaint the entire screen because what is transitioning is underneath an element.

And so we come full-circle, almost all the way back to what the original implementation used, which used $.fn.hasClass() which basically does a string indexOf() under the hood which this pull request is proposing.

The one thing we were trying to do with hasClass() was make sure we didn't get any false positives since some of the button hierarchies built up use classes like ui-btn, ui-btn-inner, ui-btn-text, etc.

Three quick updates that I made you might be interested in. 
- `$.fn.attr()` -> `$.fn.prop()` 

`disabled` is a boolean attribute and per the 1.6.1 docs `prop` is the prefered method for accessing and updating booleans on elements. Credit to @eddiemonge for pointing this out and helping me to understand that the distinction pertains mostly to boolean properties.

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/0ffaab8d223733a3695328630e5e9902f570baa1
- I chose to reference the text wrapper element directly instead of exposing the implementation via the class selector. This way the `buttonMarkup` helper can change how it creates and references the element without anyone having to know about the details.

There has been a change of behaviour between 1.2 (error) and 1.3 (stripping). We decided that if we make changes again it should be a permanent solution, so we don't keep changing things each version. We didn't have enough time to do this for 1.4 so it has to wait until 1.5.

From the 1.4 changelog: ""Deprecated current behaviour of stripping query strings from hashes. Starting in 1.5 we’ll be following spec on hashes and provide a hook to handle custom navigation.""

In the meantime we will look into a workaround that can be used with 1.3 and 1.4. When there is one we will inform you about it in a comment on this ticket.

I've actually seen this problem before. It's not actually firing multiple events. It's a bug in Chrome where it is echoing _EVERYTHING_ written to the log again any time you write to the log. If you actually attach the log-page-events bookmarklet, it somehow fills up the console buffer with enough text that the bug does not happen.

You can also verify that this is a console bug by simply throwing an alert. You will see that the alert only happens once as expected.

The flashing is due to focus() being set on the actual page element when transitioning to pages with no .ui-title. This was introduced in beta 3 by this checkin:

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/97539ed3bdafb21fc2627e9026ce3041893644bb

Ok, the flashing isn't due to the actual focus() call, but instead, is related to the CSS outline property which is enabled when the element has focus. This seems to be the same flashing problem that occurs when transitioning with a text input focused. I'm able to stop the flashing with:

There are a couple of options here with trade-offs.
1. Add our own `_init` implementation as in the patch I posted above. One downside here is if someone wants to extend the jquerymobile widget they need to juggle the init to preserve our events. I talked with @ajpiano and he said that in jqueryui 1.9 it will invoke the super method so we've be fine here in the future as long as we plan to upgrade the jqueryui widget factory. My only real concern is that someone, somewhere has extended the mobile widget, defined init, and will hate me for all eternity if I break their code.
2. Decorate the `_create` method with a follow up `_trigger( 'aftercreate' )`. Fragile and is generally not very robust in the face of change. I don't like monkeypatching/decorating it surprises people and me down the road.
3. Alter the `jquery.ui.widget.js` and add the `_trigger( 'aftercreate' )` to the end of the `_create` method after the call to `_init`. Downside being that we now have to manage changes to the ui widget vs our patch unless we decide talk with the ui guys and move it upstream. In the latter case it would actually be `_trigger( 'init' )` to follow on with the convention of calling `_trigger( 'create' )` after calling the `_create` method. 

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.ui.widget.js#L158

You'll notice above that line the ordering goes create, trigger create, init, no trigger. 

I'll probably go with the first option and ask @toddparker to write it up in the blogpost in the hopes that people will raise an alarm. I still think `aftercreate` is the right event in this case.

2217,2011-09-15 21:45:53,"@toddparker @gseguin @johnbender

Why not just call the event ""init"" ... and place the trigger after the init call in the UI base widget?

That way all widgets end up with a:
- &lt;widget&gt;create - Widget has been constructed but not initialized.
- &lt;widget&gt;init - Widget has been constructed and initialized and is ready to go.

When you click on this link, jQM should:
- make the querystring available somehow in the ""pagebeforeshow"" event
- render #basepage, with the complete url (#basepage?city=a&state=b), so that it is bookmarkable
- update the history, so the back-button works properly
- work on all browsers

The problem I have is inconsistent behavior on different browsers, especially when clicking multiple links with different query strings...

Some have suggested that the solution is to render all possible pages on the server, each with their own unique

That approach would not work for me.

453,2011-12-13 07:42:54,"A couple of things to consider: 
1. As Scott mentioned, switching to either SCSS or LESS adds to the contribution learning curve.
2. Our core devs who handle the CSS don't have experience with either LESS or SCSS, and while they both represent strict supersets of CSS using them properly (eg, avoiding overeager nesting) takes time/experience. @toddparker @Wilto and @scottjehl will have to make a determination here.
3. Adding an external dependency means another source of possible upstream issues. In any case we're actually adding _two_ dependencies in the form of a runtime and the relevant package/library. 
4. The migration path is not obvious to me. If we make a concerted effort to migrate any of the CSS we run the risk of introducing bugs where no test coverage exists (ie visuals). It's entirely possible that a slow introduction with small migrations over time is feasible, most projects I've worked on that leveraged either tool did so from the start. Some more anecdotal evidence here would be helpful.

To be clear I have used and appreciate both tools, but unless CSS is falling down hard for us in more places than just the theme roller, where I see the most obvious benefit, it seems like more trouble than it's worth.

1. As Scott mentioned, switching to either SCSS or LESS adds to the contribution learning curve.
2. Our core devs who handle the CSS don't have experience with either LESS or SCSS, and while they both represent strict supersets of CSS using them properly (eg, avoiding overeager nesting) takes time/experience. @toddparker @Wilto and @scottjehl will have to make a determination here.
