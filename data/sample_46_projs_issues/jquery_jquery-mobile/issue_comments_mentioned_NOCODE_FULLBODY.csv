Your system uses the SimSun font for latin characters. I tested on a Windows 7 system with that font and was able to reproduce the problem. I tested with many other serif and sans-serif fonts but it only happened with SimSun.

Ok, I understand what you mean but this is not a bug but expected behaviour.

When you open a popup, the page gets an overlay that covers the whole page, and the popup comes on top of it. When you click outside the popup you are clicking on the overlay, and this event triggers closing of the popup. In your example it means you are not clicking on the ""Flow"" button but on the overlay of the ""No transition"" popup.

The transition examples use a transparent overlay but you can also theme this with `data-overlay-theme` (see ""Photo lightbox"" section). If you don't want the overlay, you can use `data-dismissible=""false""`. In that case you have to handle closing the popup yourself.

I hope this helps. Closing this ticket as not a bug.

8429,2016-05-05 09:29:24,"@faabalia - I'm also currently experiencing this same issue.  I believe it has to do with a conflict between JQuery Mobile hiding the data-position=""fixed"" elements on the page (i.e. the header and footer) and the native android select options menu.

As a workaround if you hide the header and footer earlier than JQuery Mobile normally does, things work correctly.

I've added a demo of this over at stackoverflow as github markup doesn't seem to like HTML pages being inserted directly into comments: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36906229/jquery-mobile-error-with-select-menu-in-android-with-chrome-version-50

8429,2016-05-06 07:13:55,"Hi @faabalia 

I'm glad my second solution works for you - it's definitely the better option as it's much closer to addressing the cause than the first option which was a pretty far-fetched workaround.

Interesting observation regarding the text input - don't worry, there's a solution to this which just expands on my previous answer.  By adding **data-hide-during-focus=""input, textarea""** jquery-mobile will still attempt to hide the header/footer for input and textarea fields.  As you've observed, this still causes issues for your selectmenu field because it attempts to show the header and footer again when the input text field loses focus.  You can entirely remove the hide header/footer on focus functionality by instead adding

**data-hide-during-focus=""""**

to your header and footer.
",clintirving,faabalia
8429,2016-05-06 23:11:04,"Hi @faabalia - check to make sure that you have put data-hide-during-focus="""" in both your header AND your footer.  Also check to make sure that Chrome isn't loading a cached page (it often does this).  I reproduced your scenario yesterday and I believe this does fix the issue.  The value ""input, textarea, select"" for o.hideDuringFocus is just the default value in jQuery mobile of hideDuringFocus - adding the data-attribute overrides this.

3. Click ""Go back""

At this point the other page will appear below the current page, which is itself `visibility: hidden`-ed, because, upon its creation, the toolbar set all pages to be `position: relative`, so now they appear below one another.

The changes look good. I noticed one problem. When an accordion is being expanded it gets the green active style, but this style is not removed after the accordion is being collapsed. It remains green until another button gets focus. In the current situation the active style isn't really clear, but it does get removed as soon as the accordion is collapsed (http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.5-demos-issues/demos/). Can you give this a look?

Besides that there are a few minor style guide issues. See my comments in the diff.

Yes, one could apply role=""button"" to anchors (or even to divs or spans, for that matter), but why bother with that? Why not use something with the correct native semantics already there?

Thanks, I will take a look at 1.5 and the JQ UI accordion, since I am using the collapsible widget extensively.

1.
 I use my phone's browser to view the JSBin you supply, it will show the similar result as my issue both in iOS and Android. (click Event ID 1 and then click Event ID 2 quickly, both these two collapsible titles will highlight with blue background but not show any content)

2.
The testing web page was put in my server site and I linked to it through the Chrome browser under the ""Developer Tools (simulate as Apple iPhone 5)"".
Under this situation, If you move mouse (which looks like a small black circle) between two titles (ex: between Event ID 1 and Event ID 2) then the wrong issue will highly happen after you click it. 

For example,
If the black circle is much nearer to Event ID 1 than Event ID 2, it will cause the issue as following figure.

But I do want to know what changes are coming up before I embark in a lot of custom code and styling. 

Thanks for an excellent project! Let me know if I can help in any way.

The `enhanced` option has been introduced to improve performance. You can always use this option if you want. When you set the option to `true` the widget's JavaScript will skip adding classes and/or generating elements which makes things faster. Your markup have to be exactly the same as it would be if it were enhanced by the widget. See also http://api.jquerymobile.com/button/#option-enhanced

I hope this makes it clear.

That ""icon-only button with custom border-radius"" demo is indeed broken. The custom style is missing :(
I made a working demo for you in a JSBin: http://jsbin.com/kiyeze/edit?html,output

When you click the ""view source"" button of that demo, the popup contains a HTML and CSS section. That's how we do it for all demos where custom CSS is used. The same goes for when a demo uses custom JS.
In my opinion the bright pink CSS section header is hard to miss already, but I am looking into using tabs instead of collapsibles to have all sections next to each other at the top.
The title of that flipswitch demo already mentions ""custom"", but of course it's a small effort to add an intro paragraph that says that custom CSS is used.
I am going to close this ticket, because we already have ticket #8245 for things we need to do with the demos. I will add a bulletpoint for the intro paragraphs there.

This test page shows the issue from #5073: http://jsbin.com/zikohihiyu/edit?html,output

I can add CSS to negate the rules from `ui-toolbar-header-button-left/right` when the class is on a span inside a custom select menu, but then the user still doesn't get the header left/right button positioning that (s)he wants. When that ticket was opened we were automatically adding the left/right button classes but we don't do that anymore, so I think it's best to document / demonstrate that in case of a select you have to wrap it in a div and add the button left/right class to that div, never on the `select` itself.

What did we decide about how we handle classes in case of generated wrappers? To add a class to the container you need to use the classes option (or enhance the selectmenu yourself once we added that option)? Adding a class to the `select` itself is not supported?

It is based on this PR.

Even though the classes `ui-mini` and `ui-toolbar-header-button-right` are getting applied to the selectmenu wrapper, `position: absolute;` from `ui-toolbar-header-button-right` is getting overridden by `position: relative;` from `ui-selectmenu` because the latter seems to have precedence.

I think we can remove `position: relative;` for `ui-selectmenu`. The `select` element has `position: absolute;` so one of the wrapper `div`s should get `position: relative;` (or anything other than the default `static`). `ui-button` already has `relative` so I think it's safe to remove it from the outer wrapper.

Have to check with a custom selectmenu as well. I can't preview this branch on view.\* since it's in your fork. Just see if anything breaks if you remove it. I can always double check after this has been merged.

> There also seems to be a problem with the arrow icon in the button. Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong?

I suppose you mean the lack of space between text and icon? Since we make the icon float with class `ui-widget-icon-floatend` we will have to add extra padding to the button. Maybe we should do that in core/button CSS, not in selectmenu CSS. Will look into that.

@btippett This makes this sound like not a bug if the behavior is the same either way. Also i believe the behavior your describing is the intended behavior in iOS. What you are describing is the double tap to zoom feature in iOS.

When we hide the page with `visibility: hidden;` but an element on that page has `visibilty: visible;`, that element will be visible.

If you look at our transitions demo (http://view.jquerymobile.com/page-hide/demos/transitions/) on a wide screen you can see the problem that this can cause. We make the menu panel visible on wide screens with `visibilty: visible;` so when you click on any of the transitions and navigate to the next page, you still see the menu panel that's on the hidden page.

So we have to make sure that all content on the page becomes invisible. The only (ugly) way to do this is:

Good point. I forgot to change the jQuery link, sorry. I just updated http://output.jsbin.com/zigimu to use jQuery Git build, but now you'll get a JS error. I think that problem is only fixed in our 1.5-dev branch where all test against jQuery Git are green. Testing this with our 1.5-dev branch has no use because in there the selectmenu widget still needs to be updated and is currently broken.

- There is no way to know the keyboard size, and there for how much height to add to the body, on a particular device even more so when you keep in mind custom keyboards.

8130,2015-07-27 07:09:17,"@vaso123 - You can use `$.mobile.maxTransitionWidth` for this.

From the 1.2 docs:

Setting a max width for transitions
By default, transitions can be disabled (set to ""none"") when the window width is greater than a certain pixel width. This feature is useful because transitions can be distracting or perform poorly on larger screens. This value is configurable via the global option $.mobile.maxTransitionWidth, which defaults to false. The option accepts any number representing a pixel width or false value. If it's not false, the handler will use a ""none"" transition when the window is wider than the specified value.

The current docs lack this information. We are working on fixing this. Tickets: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/154 and https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/146.

Yeah it's the same problem, good catch. I am not sure if we should apply that solution though.

The root of the problem is that our demo tries to do something (removing a checkbox when you click on it) that shouldn't want to do in a real use case. If we need to add a ugly workaround just to make our demo work I think it proofs that it's not a good demo.

what if you are removing it because you want to move it to a different group (because of the ticking, deleting and recreating).
Is it a real use case? That's how i stumbled on it.
I'm not saying it for me, as i already workarounded it (by truly moving the element) but it is better if people don't meet this problem or they will think it's the lib's fault.

I only meant removing the checkbox when you click on it, so you won't get good feedback (don't see anymore which checkbox you checked) and can't uncheck it. That's a very bad UI.
Moving it from one controlgroup to another (to group unchecked and checked items separately) is fine of course. But in that case it's best to do what you did, moving the enhanced element.

The problem with the buttons inside toolbars is that the height of mini buttons increased in 1.5-dev. Because the icons are inline-block spans the text needs to have same line-height as the height of the icon to be able to vertically align the icon and text.

Thanks for the PR.

The idea was to give the last row a bit darker border bottom. Instead of removing those styles for the last row we could wrap them in a media query to make them only apply on wider screens, but I think it looks good enough without them so I am fine with removing it.

On small screens the last table row looks still a bit different than the others. This can be fixed by removing the  `.movie-list tbody tr:last-child` selector from the first rule. Can you make that change?

Right now we are just always hiding the clear button regardless of if we are adding one leaving no way to use the native if you want.

I think we should change the current rule being modified to 



And in the clear button extension we should add the class `ui-textinput-hide-clear` to the input  when we add a clear button. 

This way if a clear button is added by jqm we hide the native clear. If no clear button is added we leave the default native if available. If you want no clear button at all native or jqm then you can simply add `.ui-textinput-hide-clear` to the input your self and make sure `clearBtn` option is `false` ( the default ) .

First of all, jQuery Mobile is a team/contributors effort. Even if this was an actual regression, it has nothing to do with who is project lead.

When you inspect your test page you'll see that the padding-top is removed from the page when you remove the first page. Probably because we had to make a change between 1.4.3 and 1.4.5 to fix an issue with page padding or fixed headers. Like @arschmitz said removing the first page is currently not supported. If you want to do it anyway you have to understand that your code might break, even in a maintenance release. We don't test it.

Conversely, if this.options.classes[ this.classProp ] is not modified (i.e., equal to the value in the prototype), then we must assume that legacy code is in place, and we must use the value of the various style options to construct this.options.classes[ this.classProp ]

as the default action. I'm assuming there's a way of retrieving the URL for which the default action is to be taken.

That's what the click handler ends up calling anyway. The only piece you'll be missing is the click handlers checks which make sure the URL is one it can handle.

I'm going to reopen the issue because it sheds light on an aspect of navigation we need to keep in mind when we do the nav refactor.

It seems that we need to roll navigation in such a way that it can serve as a link in a daisy chain of different navigation implementations.

<h2>One way to go</h2>

The easiest way to do this is to maybe factor out the click handler into its own module, providing two items: The click handler logic, but without actually attaching the event handler.

So, like,



You could then detach the handler yourself, reversing the action of js/navigation.js, while continuing to have access to the code that runs, but having to call the handler yourself from, say, the default action of a backbone router.

<h2>A better way to go</h2>

Build the click handler into a pagecontainer widget extension, predicated upon a boolean option which enables the event handler:



This latter approach would give us per-pagecontainer widget click handling. We probably also need to add the vclick handler, and maybe even the form submit handler to the widget.

At this point we have supplanted `linkBindingEnabled` and made it per-pagecotnainer. Then we can also move pushStateEnabled, hashListeningEnabled, and ajaxEnabled into the pagecontainer widget's options.

The `options` parameter to `handleClick()` could be used to pass options which temporarily override the value of the widget-widge options, much like the way popup accepts overrides from the link (such as, for example, `position-to`).

@starnutoditopo a modification such as this would then allow you to

The clear button doesn't show up because class `ui-textinput-clear-hidden` is not removed from the clear button when the input gets focus. That class sets `display: none;`. So this is probably a JS problem in js/widgets/forms/clearButton.js.

The problem with the search icon is that it uses the wrong icon color. With theme A it should use the dark icon but instead the white one is used. This is probably a CSS issue. I will investigate.

We should not land this PR, because it's not the right fix for the problem.

We shouldn't make any changes that could result in setting it for anything else than `html` and `body`.

If speed is your concern disable transitions and there will be essentially no time involved. 

That being said this widget is on its way out. We will be switching to the jQuery UI selectmenu once it has all the options we need. ( likely 1.6 ) this will not have a full page fallback like this. We will not be doing any updates to the current widget only fixing bugs until then.

7805,2014-10-29 10:53:02,"@arschmitz I was going to suggest to @jackyon building a custom version of jQuery Mobile using the download builder. At that point I discovered a few problems:
1. The swipe events are inside events/touch, so if you wanna build without them, you need to uncheck events/touch, however this leads to the following problems: navigation.js (because of the vclick handler that adds the active button class) depends on vclick, so on events/touch. Thus, attempting to build without swipe will also remove vclick, which basically removes navigation and init. We might want to split swipe out of events/touch and maybe put it into events/swipe - although I haven't checked if swipe uses internal variables also used by other events inside events/touch.
2. navigation.js and pagecontainer depends on events.js, not events/touch, events/throttledresize, and events/navigate individually. Thus, we should also update that dependency, and eventually remove events.js entirely, because it's an empty module.

Chrome adds 3px margin at the bottom of inline block elements which makes the `.ui-select` wrapper `div` 3px higher than the other elements in the group. That's just browser default style, not a browser bug.

I will make a change in the CSS to make sure we override `inline-block` for the select button.

If you use `clear: left;` (or `both`) it will go all the way to the left, but we can't use that of course because we don't know what button has to go to a new row.

http://jsbin.com/sifezo/1/

So, which one renders correctly? FF or Chrome?

Note that, in Chrome, if you set the .ui-btn padding to greather than, like, 0.9em, it starts to work the same way as FF. That's why I figured it was a Chrome bug - maybe a rounding error somewhere.

7793,2015-01-08 13:01:23,"@gabrielschulhof - Using `em` values for top/bottom padding does give some unexpected results in Chrome and that is probably a rounding bug (has been reported).
I think the reason that the buttons in your test page don't have the same height is that for the first button `inline-block` is applied to an element that does have siblings, while in case of the other buttons it is applied to an element without siblings. Maybe Chrome's default browser style for `inline-block` elements is conditional or maybe there is a bug. I am not sure.
Comparing Firefox and Chrome isn't useful I think because their default style for `inline-block` can be different, without it being a bug.

You should be using `.prop( ""checked"" )` because that's what actually controls the checked state of the input. The attribute is used for specifying the default value of the input, not the current value. Setting the attribute actually modifies the markup, whereas setting the property does not modify the markup.

Nevertheless, it seems that setting the attribute also causes the property to be updated, so the widget should certainly reflect the state of the input after a `refresh()`.

So i'm going to keep this open but change the Title to Document translation and internationalization points. 

Off the top of my head the the only two places i can think of are page loading message http://api.jquerymobile.com/loader/#option-text and the text for the flip switch http://api.jquerymobile.com/flipswitch/#option-offText.

7787,2014-10-19 18:47:17,"@PanderMusubi Nothing in jQuery Mobile uses i18n files these are just widget options you would need to change based on your local.

",arschmitz,PanderMusubi
7787,2014-10-20 07:24:38,"@arschmitz We can call .toString() on all string-valued option names that are supposed to be translatable. That way, if the values are strings, well, nothing happens. However, you can replace the strings with objects that provide the .toString() method. The objects themselves could then be translation-aware. This would take care of translating the string upon insertion into the DOM.

If we need re-translation while the widget is already instantiated, we can probably achieve that with the widget's refresh() method.

We can then provide the translations themselves separately, maybe as a mobileinit handler.
",gabrielschulhof,arschmitz
7787,2014-10-20 13:06:09,"We've already settled on this and as @arschmitz has said you just need to change the options. Using a translation library like gettext won't make this any easier. Either way you have to load the data. When translating your application, you most likely want to just change the default values, so it's a one-time config which can easily be generated on the server, where I'm sure you're already doing translations anyway.

@gabaum10 can you trying triggering update layout after you add the dynamic content but before you change orientation?
",arschmitz,gabaum10
7784,2014-10-20 20:30:31,"@arschmitz That's essentially what it's doing.  Here's the app flow:
1. Load view.  It fires an API request to get a list of stuff.
2. Once the request returns, it renders all the stuff, with a point of emphasis on it using a document fragment to only append the li's once.  It triggers the listview refresh when everything is appended.  
3. Then it programmatically sets the scroll to the bottom of the list using ""$.mobile.silentScroll()""
4. Once that's all set up, I rotate the device.  The listview scrolls up to the top.  
",gabaum10,arschmitz
7784,2014-10-20 20:32:42,"@gabaum10 `$.mobile.silentScroll()` doesn't trigger `scroll` event, that's why when `scroll` is triggered on `orientationchange` it scrolls to top.

So if you instead `$(window).scrollTop($(""listview"")[0].scrollHeight);` it should work.
",Palestinian,gabaum10

7784,2014-10-20 20:40:03,"@arschmitz triggering updatelayout didn't do the trick.  I triggered it on the listview.  Should I be triggering it on the page div?  

In the meantime, I was able to get the hack I mentioned in the original post to work by doing this, although that effectively doesn't allow you to scroll to the top and keep it there, but whatever:

I was able to reproduce the test here: http://jsbin.com/giwitu/1/ sporadically on my Samsung Galaxy S5 in chrome.

If the documentation is clear about which elements are supported, why would you call the plugin on anything else? I don't think we should add code to the library to prevent plugins from running if the developer does something that is not supported according to the documentation.

On LG G3 there comes a popup, and the background is grayed out, but on Nexus 7 it is just like a dropdown. So on LG G3 I can't select/do anything else. If I try then the popup disappears. On Nexus 7 I can select/do/click on other buttons/select because nothing is grayed out.

This does look like a bug, however these seems to be device specific ( too often device specific bugs are not fixable :-1:  ) We are also replacing our controlgroup widget in 1.5. Since none of the team members have been able to reproduce this yet and we can fix it if we cant reproduce it.

Thanks for your request. We are planning on a rewrite of the panel widget for 1.6 or 1.7. If we want to make this possible it has to wait until then.

Personally I am not in favor of this change. Most of all because I think it's not user-friendly. I am curious what kind of content you have in the panels that you want to be open at the same time. Besides that it will cause some other issues.
For reveal and push panels it would mean squeezing the page content instead of shifting it. I don't think that's a good idea, so it should only be allowed for overlay panels.
Then there is the problem that the JS has to know about the width of the panels (which is defined in the CSS) and the width of the window. Also think about resizing / changing orientation while two panels are open.
We are considering adding top and bottom panels. Having top/bottom and left/right panels open at the same time should probably prevented as well.

Closing this ticket as feature request.
",jaspermdegroot,jodator
7704,2014-09-23 08:30:21,"@wwalc 

You might want to take a look at how we've done the same for our demos. The menu at the left is a panel, but we made its content always visible at wider screens with some custom CSS. At the right we have an overlay panel for search.
",jaspermdegroot,wwalc
7700,2014-09-25 13:20:46,"@frequent Im little tossed about this because there are differences between a list and a table. For example the way you navigate a list when using a screen reader is different then a table. Also the way the announce them is different. Also you now getting the link arrow and hover styling on the list ( which is actually a table so should not get this ). It seems to me like this is creating more problems then it is solving. 
",arschmitz,frequent
7700,2014-09-25 22:21:41,"@arschmitz Of course tables and lists are apples and oranges. I should have said, `make a table look like a listview on a small device`. Then it's technically still a table. 

If you look around there are no real good implementations out there for handling tables on mobile (JQM being one of the few providing solutions). And in fact, outside of using JQM, do you see a lot of tables on smartphone? To me lists are the predominant way of displaying a number of records on a small screen. Maybe a reason other frameworks like [ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/components/) or [onsenui](http://onsenui.io/guide/components.html) don't even bother to provide something-table.

From my personal experience, the columntoggle is nice while hardcoding. But once you try to squeeze something large, dynamic and existing into the table widget, things like the column-priority needing to be set are quickly making it a drag.

Actually the reflow isn't so far off from a listview ""look"" (another [example](http://jsbin.com/nahugimojafi/2/edit)). Plus you'd save having to generate the header cell for every row.

Anyway, thanks for feedback. I hadn't thought of the screenreader :-)
",frequent,arschmitz
7700,2014-09-25 22:55:39,"@frequent I do agree with you about tables on mobile. I also would say your implementation is one of the better looking examples. The issue comes when in a screen reader tables and lists are navigable via keyboard but the navigation works different so for partially sighted people it will look like a list but it will announce and navigate as a table this might be odd. 

You will notice i have left this issue open and not just closed as a feature request. I would be open to adjusting the table styling and function in reflow or looking into this more. if you could talk to @gabrielschulhof hes working on a re-write of tables right now. 

catch me on irc and we can discuss more.

7698,2014-09-22 21:11:07,"@NikitaForm 

Thanks for reporting the issue. The problem is caused by `data-theme=""b""` for the content.
`data-role=""content""` and setting a theme for it has been deprecated in 1.4. We already recommended to only set a theme for the page and not for the content, because the page can be longer than the content. As from 1.5 we will drop support for theming the content. You can use class `ui-content` to have padding.
So the problem won't exist anymore in 1.5, but it is a bug in 1.4. Since it's easy to work around it (just don't set theme for the content as we recommend) and it would be really hard to solve the problem in our theme CSS, we we are not going to spend time on fixing this in 1.4 if we do another maintenance release.

We fixed it with commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/bafa5d95d1ae2f028749c710aa198b96de7eeb3d but that change turned out to cause accessibility problems (issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6583) so we decided to revert it (PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6584, commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/71c823e81ce48ef9bb4d314dc9d8381ba182760f).
We will test it on an Android ~~4.2~~ 4.1.2 device and look into a new solution.

Thanks for reporting the issue. Please use our JS Bin template which uses latest code on master for test pages. Don't modify the library but add overrides to illustrate issues. Leave everything out that is not relevant (like the flow transition, just use buttons instead of images for navigation, etc.). See the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues) for instructions and link to the template.

I created a JS Bin for this issue: http://jsbin.com/sekujuqa/16/edit. I can reproduce it on both an iPad Retina and iPhone 5. Actually I don't even have to navigate away and back from the homepage. After loading the test page I can already scroll up the page and notice the issue.

7682,2014-09-23 10:30:20,"Hi Jasper, thanks for your feedback. Please can you re-open this issue as #6136 is not related to the bug im reporting. The Panel Swipe does show the extended body but does not replicate the body content being moved up. The jsbin example also does not produce this.

As per the screenshots I provided, onload UI is fullscreen with everything in place,( but there is the ability to scroll the body, and when given a color you clearly see this). When you Navigate to another page, orientate change device and return, the extended body actual effects the UI, moving it up. I have tested on three Web Apps I have developed using different JQM versions, and they all do this on iPad Air (I dont have earlier versions to test on, would be good to know if it effects all iPads).

To me this appears to be a major bug for JQuery Mobile, and would like it reported, and to be given a resolution! Are you able to help with this.

Many Thanks Paul

If you need to see how this actually affects an App, go to Mobi3g.com with an iPad Air and follow the orientation sequence, dont worry Im routing Tablets, you will see how the header and content moves up.

So firstly this bug is not directly a JQ Mobile thing, but does effect the framework in a bad way. I guess im asking the JQM dev team to look into this, and come up with a better solution. All I can do is give feedback that it exisits!

Only tested in iPad Air, be good to know how other versions respond, including the Mini(retina) as mentioned in the article.

This JS Bin shows the correct markup for buttons in the navbar widget: http://jsbin.com/sekujuqa/14/edit

Also the navigate event is meant to be used only in a standalone app not using the JQM in JQM navigate only triggers on the first load not every change. If you want events surrounding the changing of page both internal or external please use the pagecontainer events. From the sounds of it pagecontainerbeforechange is what your looking for. it is the first step in the nav process and is cancelable.

The `navigate` event fires before `pagebeforechange` but after `popstate` and `hashchange`.

The only way is to stop `hashchange` is by `pushstate()` current URL and change same page `allowSamePageTransition` without transition. This works fine except for transition to previous page when panel is closed upon navigating. This requires modifying jQM's navigation history.

I'm missing something for sure.

Looks good, but I wouldn't use class names with the ""ui-"" prefix for non-framework classes. I suggest something like `my-footer-btn-left`. 
",jaspermdegroot,gabrielschulhof
7634,2014-08-25 08:03:26,"As I wrote in my comments at the tickets @jtsage referred to, the `ui-btn-left` and `ui-btn-right` are designed for the header only, not for the footer. If we are going to add a demo of using those classes in the footer with some custom CSS for overriding/setting the top and bottom offset, users will get the impression it's a supported feature to use those classes in the footer that way and expect the same results as with headers. The problem with text in footers illustrates that this isn't the case.

If we add a demo of absolutely positioned buttons in a footer I think it's better to only use custom CSS, and not the `ui-btn-left` and `ui-btn-right` classes. Other benefit is that things won't break if we make changes in the CSS rules for those classes.

Update: I just saw the PR (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/7635) for this ticket. The text above the demo does make clear that users shouldn't expect the same result as with headers. I still think it's better to not use the classes at all.

Actually 1.4.2 was bugged. See https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7266.
From the beginning the framework makes buttons inside toolbars default to mini. That should also apply to buttons in controlgroups.

However, I am in favor of deprecating this behaviour and just leave it up to the developer to use small or large buttons in toolbars. The same goes for inline (currently the framework makes single buttons default to inline inside toolbars). We will discuss this with the team.

This means that jQM will not leave the element alone. It means that it will proceed with creation of the widget, but without injecting any new DOM elements necessary for the widget's structure.

The only way to tell jQM to leave alone an element that would otherwise be selected for enhancement is to add `data-role=""none""` to the element.

Border width (1px) and style (solid) are set in the structure CSS. Only border color is set in the theme CSS. Not only for toolbars, but in general. The reason we do this is because many widgets require borders. For example listviews and controlgroups. If the border-width would be part of the theme and you don't use the theme CSS there won't be seperator between the items anymore. We can't make an exception for toolbars because its ""bar-style"" is also used for things like list dividers. To use toolbars without borders you have to add `.ui-header, .ui-footer { border: 0; }` to your custom CSS.

I see your point about border style belonging in theme CSS and not structure CSS, but I think it depends on the widget. For toolbars the borders are just style, but for widgets where borders are necessary (listviews, etc.) it is part of structure. As long as we use a theme with body, bar, and button styles instead of widget specific styles we can't really change this. So I think this is more something to look into for 2.0.

The -1px offset and the 1px padding is to solve a 1px gap problem with fixed toolbars on Android. We unset this for hidden fixed toolbars to prevent a scrollbar (see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/1c1c3ec8d47fc56cc9f8da5779dab89474ed5300). Hiding the toolbars is part of the tap toggle feature which you've set to `false`. So I don't see how a rule for `ui-fixed-hidden` can cause an issue in your case and I can't reproduce it either.

Can you provide another JS Bin, without any overrides/solutions, just to show the problem? On what browser do you test?

7546,2014-07-12 09:48:16,"@frankie-loves-jesus 

Thanks! Now I see the issue because on this test page you didn't set `tapToggle` to `false` like in your previous test pages. The selectmenu is not relevant because you will see the issue even when you tap/click on an empty page: http://jsbin.com/sekujuqa/6.

There is already a ticket for this problem so I leave this one closed. See last line of my comment here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5645#issuecomment-13610121.

Ps. You added `* { margin: 0; padding: 0; }` to your test page. Applying rules like that to all elements could mask/introduce issues, so you really shouldn't use that on test pages that are meant to debug CSS issues.

7533,2014-10-06 19:17:36,"@ldeluca OK, excellent observation. If this is the case, then popups must indeed be opened via the pagecontainer ""change"" method, because that introduces sufficient ""distance"" (in terms of asynchronicity) between the click event and the opening of the popup. I implemented that for the custom selectmenu in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b0a802db5bd621b3e1c14a7d9816ae12dae21a93.
",gabrielschulhof,ldeluca
7533,2014-10-06 19:51:18,"@ldeluca if you wanna do a PR to fix this issue, you wanna look at the effect of removing

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L604

Try removing it or unwinding the stack before focusing.

The reason for the .focus() call there is to put the focus on an element (the popup's container div) that will be a valid element in the focus-restricted environment that the popup produces. It produces this environment by handling the focusin event at the document level while it's open

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L289

and transferring focus to an element inside the popup if it finds that an element that is not the child of the popup container has received focus.

To make sure your solution works correctly, you must test it on a page that includes a text input which can receive the focus by repeatedly pressing the Tab key on the page and a popup. Whenever the popup is on the screen, the text input must not be reachable via either the mouse or the keyboard.

Note that you can still trick Firefox (and maybe Chrome) into giving the text input focus by typing some text into it, then opening the popup, then searching on the page for the text you've typed. This works especially well in Firefox because of its type-to-search feature. There's no way around this (that I know of) so don't worry if that breaks the focus restriction.

7533,2014-10-06 21:43:01,"@gabrielschulhof I tried removing the call to _desiredCoords and tested but am still seeing the blue flash.  Removing the _desiredCoords call just put the popup near the button instead of at the bottom of the page.  Seems like a different issue?  

It looks like the issue is more about the style that is being applied.  The blue glow must be a :focus css style somewhere is my guess.  You sure line https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L604 is the right spot to be looking?

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L642

That is, the line that calls .focus() on the popup container element after the popup has finished opening.

I'm thinking though that the line cannot be removed because whatever element is focused before the popup opens cannot remain focused, otherwise we cannot claim that the popup restricts focus while open.

Trying different values for the popup containers focus style might not be such a bad idea though!

Here's the detail as asked in your contributing guidelines : 
The detail of a ""news"" is just supposed to be displayed, and it works correctly on almost every platform (Android for every version, Iphone 4 with IOS 6), except on the Safari browser by default on Iphone 5C with IOS 7 (7.0 & 7.1.) where I have the JQuery code output.
As told before, the version of Jquery mobile that we use is 1.3.1 (with Jquery 1.10.1), and I tryed to upgrade it to the last ont stable (1.4.2), but it didn't correct the issue. If I remove jquery mobile, there's no bug anymore.
I removed the HTML that was outside the <html> element (used for a statistics tool) on our test platform, and the issue is still there.
For example, on this page: http://m.ffgolf.org/Vivre-golf/Sante/Licencies-inscrivez-vous/ (if I reload it, the issue is gone).

Personnally, I dont see the problem because I don't have an IPhone in that version, by my client do.
He told me that he doesn't have the problem when he's using his personnal Wi-fi, and it's only in 3G (weird...).
I don't use the unminified version of jQuery mobile, becausehte minified one is faster, but if you see the issue I can change that and use the normal version if it helps.

I generated the code on your JS BIN template, here's the link : http://jsbin.com/wocutuke/1/watch.

Thanks, but this is still not a simple test page. You just copied one page from your site in a JS Bin. You really need to strip everything that is not relevant; images, long content, custom styles (it doesn't need to look good), scripts that have not to do with jQuery Mobile, etc., etc..
Just reduce it to the minimum that is required to reproduce the issue. JavaScript that is needed to reproduce the issue should be included in the JS Bin instead of pointing to a script on your server. Since the issue becomes visible after navigating from the homepage to another page you might need to create a test page with two pages instead of a single page.
Like we say in the contributing guidelines the test page should be loading latest code of jQuery Mobile (links are in our JS Bin template), but you changed it to 1.3.1.
Of course I understand that you use minified jQuery core for the production site, but I am talking about using unminified in the test page for debugging the issue. On the screenshot that you posted you see jQuery core code being written to the document but it is minified code so it's a bit hard to see what part of the code it is and where things go wrong.

So a few things here. First there is a warning in the docs i need to double check has not got lost in the move last year that you must always have a trailing `/` on links or else we will treat it as a file. So in the example of `http://www.noscience.dk/git` this is a bad link and so we are treating it as a file not a directory. 

In the case of  `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php#page2` and going to `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php#/gitindex.php` This is because all links are based on the current directory as the base because we need to know about any internal page navigation. Example the actual page loaded in both links is `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php` but the original page is `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php#page2` we need to know that you have navigated to just `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php` because you are not using an id on your original page for your navigation ex `page1` its internal ""id"" ( or data-url ) is `#gitindex.php`.

You can use the `refresh()` method for that. This method is documented. The only problem I see is that the documentation says ""update a custom menu"" while you can use it for both native and custom: http://jsbin.com/AKOmUxa/171/edit. I will open a ticket for that at the API docs repo.

This issue is caused by your custom CSS. If you remove this, the problem will be gone:



There are some weird bugs in WP8 with 3D transforms. That's also why we disabled transitions for panels on  WP8 in case the page contains a fixed header (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6349).
The header doesn't completely dissapear by the way. When you rotate the device to landscape you will see that it has been shifted to the right (out of view in portrait).

Yes I would like to not have to refresh, because the translation plugin will run over the DOM anyway and then I need to re-query the DOM for all inputs and do a manual refresh. Also I'm wondering if I `refresh` is the only method I need on the widget, I could live without creating the widget.

If it was a `<span>` I would do pre-enhancing:



and set the same `data-i18n=""[value]...""` on the input.

If JQM handles enhancement, I set the input value as above and for the `<span>` I would probably improvise and declare on a parent with a child selector for the `span.translate` which for example is possible in i18next.

Making the widget wrap the text in a `span` doesn't really match with reducing of DOM manipulation that we have been working on for all widgets. However, it would be nice if the refresh method wouldn't remove the `span` in a pre-enhanced widget.

We are going to rewrite the panel widget (not sure yet in which version this will land) and will consider making this behaviour optional.

7283,2014-04-10 19:35:20,"@jtara thank you for your example however pageinit is an event issued by the page widget it is only being deprecated because it is no longer needed. It's original purpose was it provided a particular timing needed for some widget auto enhance code. However this was due to our old event based autoinit which we have since replaced with a non event based solution which allows for better timing so no the page widgets built in create event can be used and init will be removed. If you have a use case where pagecreate does not properly replace pageinit please open a separate issue for this. 

However this issue is about page events vs pagecontainer events which is a very different issue. 

Note: looking briefly at your code the only thing you need to do is change pageinit to pagecreate in your first binding.

@arschmitz: In order to test this, I plan to simulate two mouse clicks on the slider/rangeslider.

",arschmitz,jugglinmike
7274,2014-05-10 00:52:19,"@arschmitz I've run up against a problem: I can't reproduce this in the test environment as it stands today. The environment [explicitly depends on the `init` module](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/39fe09ebf3d40321b7d7c389c1b5676b01093971/tests/unit/slider/index.html#L24), which [depends on the `navigation` module](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/39fe09ebf3d40321b7d7c389c1b5676b01093971/js/init.js#L16), which [depends on the `events` module](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/39fe09ebf3d40321b7d7c389c1b5676b01093971/js/navigation.js#L13), which [depends on the `events/touch` module](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/39fe09ebf3d40321b7d7c389c1b5676b01093971/js/events.js#L6).

This means that the change I'm proposing will be undetectable from that
environment. I've written a passing test, but it passes even without my change.
As it stands, regressions wouldn't be detected.

Some of the existing tests depend on the `init` module. I think those tests
should be moved to a separate document, maybe named `slider_auto_init.html`.

I want to hear your thoughts on that approach before I try that, though.
Whatever we decide on, we'll most likely have to do something similar for the
RangeSlider. What do you think?

For tests which we explicitly don't want the init module, like for these tests I think we should add those to the individual module tests so in this case the additional tests would go in the slider_core and rangeslider_core files you added already. We probably want to reconsider the organization of these tests as we add more ( not just being all in a single folder as they are now but thats more or less unrelated )

First your are navigating on document ready which is part way through the frame work initialization process so is not going to have the desired effect and is almost guaranteed to cause problems. If you just want to show a loader with a message I suggest you use the loader widget. Also navigate is not a supported way to navigate between two jquery-mobile pages. please see the note here http://api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.navigate/ also you are using a data-role of index on your first page not page this is not a supported data-role.

#6975 2: The Revenge Of The Popup

The popup created by the selectmenu gets an ID that's derived from the selectmenu's own ID and has the following pattern: `<selectmenuId>-listbox`.

Thus, you can hook up like this: `$( ""#<selectmenuId>-listbox"" ).on( ""popupafteropen"", function() { /* ... */ });`

I completely replaced my page1.html and page2.html with your examples, replacing only the link. The problem is still present on my pages (though note that theres a few issues with the markup, like duplicated ID's on the second page).

I cannot trust that jsbin is operating as a normal web page would. My environment is a vanilla apache web server and there is no special fetching or iframes included. I can't quite figure out how jsbin is retrieving the second page after analyzing Chrome devtools. I see a request is made to `http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1198?0.5647212639451027`, and the MIME type is `text/event-stream`, but I'm not sure what that means here? The response is blank as analyzed in the dev tools.

I urge you to please consider my example, or to quickly setup your own. I'm sure you have a local web server on your computer where you can simply place two HTML pages. I can't seem to get jsbin to work properly. I would be more trusting if I could view the standalone page and link to the other standalone page, without using that edit view.

Thanks for sharing your work on this!

A carousel widget was indeed part of our old roadmap, from before our plan to merge with jQuery UI. We decided not to add to the new roadmap (yet) because we have to discuss a new widget like this with the UI team first.

It's a popular feature, but there are several ways you can do this and not just only one good way. That's why it might be better to show how you could do it (3rd party plugin demo) instead of adding a new widget for it.

Thanks for reporting the issue. I tested with 1.3.2 (http://jsbin.com/AKOmUxa/112/edit) because I wasn't sure if we did support it before, but it turned out that it used to work so this is a regression.

I noticed here http://api.jquerymobile.com/collapsible/#option-iconpos that we also mention ""notext"" (icon-only) as possible icon position. That resulted in a broken button style in 1.3.

I changed the test page a bit: http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/155/edit

The problems I see:
- Only `expandCueText` is used. The hidden text doesn't change to the `collapseCueText` when expanding the collapsible.
- Can't change `expandCueText` programmatically (probably the same for ``collapseCueText`)
- Can't change option `theme` programmatically

Your test page uses 1.3.2 instead of latest code. It is on your sever, so we can't make any changes or it might change while we look into it. Your test page contains a lot of irrelevant markup/code that probably has nothing to do with the issue, but makes it harder to debug and there are also 404 errors. We ask for a simple/reduced test case.

You said the issue occurs on an iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 running iOS7 (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/7014#issuecomment-33926570). We know there are issues with fixed toolbars on iOS when the keyboard pops up. See also #5062, #5532, #4113 and #5556. We try to find a solution.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprecation

""Deprecation is a status applied to a computer software feature, characteristic, or practice indicating it should be avoided, typically because it is being superseded.""

By saying the slider and rangeslider widgets are deprecated in 1.4.0, you are recommending that people avoid using these widgets as of now. Is that what you intended?

7019,2014-01-30 13:50:24,"@globalmatt the current slider has many problems and bugs which are unfixable without a full re-write. its performance is very very bad also. While we would like to fix this asap we just dont have time or man power right now to do so. We will continue to have a slider available but its api is subject to change without a prior versions notice. The new slider will be shared between both jQuery ui and jQuery Mobile and will replace the current sliders in both projects

7019,2014-01-30 21:24:15,"@arschmitz That's great to hear. However, are you saying that people should stop using sliders and range sliders right now, in 1.4.0? Because that is what ""deprecated"" means. If so, fair enough, but I'm unclear as to what people should be using as alternatives to these widgets right now. Should they be replacing all their sliders with text inputs?

It seems to me that you should deprecate the current slider and rangeslider widgets in 1.5, once you have the better alternative widgets available.

This is not a test page using latest code. Please read the contributing guidelines I pointed you at.
Your code shows you are using 1.2.1. I strongly recommend using latest version, 1.4.0. We won't do maintenance releases for 1.2 or 1.3 anymore.
When you develop with PhoneGap you are still targeting/testing a specific platform (Android, iOS, Windows Phone, etc.). We need to know on what OS and version the issue occurs.
I also noticed you load ""jqm-docs.css"". If that's the CSS from the jQuery Mobile docs & demos I wouldn't recommend using that because it was specifically written for the demos and can cause conflicts.

Dialogs are the same as pages, only styled differenty. So it's not a bug that the `pageshow` event is fired.

I updated your test page to latest code. Because `pageshow` is deprecated in 1.4 I used the `show` event of the new Pagecontainer widget. By adding a check if the event is not fired for a page that is a dialog you can resolve the problem. http://jsbin.com/AKOmUxa/104/edit

As for why you would want an id in that form i dont know but its a valid id therefor it should work.

You said you don't have a panel on your page, but you were also talking about `data-display=""overlay""` and removing a part of the panel CSS resolves the problem. That doesn't make sense.
We really need a test page, like @gabrielschulhof asked. Just paste your markup in the JS Bin template. If you can only reproduce with a custom theme, paste all the custom CSS in the bin as well, and change the link to only load structure CSS (also make sure theme comes before structure CSS).

@ldeluca after reviewing your video, the ruling on the field stands...
The transition is indeed very slow but did you notice the flickering? Here is a timetable:
...
sec. 14: the button 'Take me back' is pressed
sec. 18: the new page is shown the first time, notice that the 'non-fixed' footer is shown a footer hight above the bottom
sec. 18 -> 20: fade to white/blank page
sec. 20: the new page is shown again, but this time the footer is correct

The filter extension of the listview widget has been removed and replaced by the new (generic) filterable widget. However, we added code to make the old way still work in 1.4 (this will be removed in 1.5). So the issue you reported is a bug. Workaround is to call the filterable plugin: http://jsbin.com/EgOzEfIL/11/edit

I also tried the new way, by adding the filter input in the markup, but there seems to be an issue there too (the input is not enhanced): http://jsbin.com/EgOzEfIL/16/edit

Thanks for reporting the issue. This problem occurs because your anchor elements don't contain any text. Even when you want icon-only buttons you should use text for accessibility reasons (screen readers, no JS).

In 1.3 we did set a height for icon-only buttons in controlgroups, but that caused small height differences between icon-only buttons and buttons with text.

I don't think we should make any changes here. We did mention that icon-only buttons should contain text in our old docs, but I am not sure if this info landed in our current API docs. I will check this and, if not, open a ticket in the API docs repo.

Happy New Year :-)

Your first example: If you decide to have a header without a heading, you need to add an element with <code>class=""ui-title""</code>  to show the toolbar. http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/toolbar/ > Buttons in headers without a heading.
http://jsbin.com/IFolanOW/49/edit

Second example: To add a button into a footer toolbar, you need to add the <code>ui-btn-left</code> or <code>ui-btn-right</code> classes>to it.
This because the footer has no reserved slots for buttons like headers have.
And because of the deprecated pre-positioning for buttons in toolbars in 1.4, it's also good practice to always add the above mentioned classes to toolbar buttons.

The third example is not a bug in the new theme. The `ui-btn-left` and `ui-btn-right` were never meant to be used in a footer and you will get the same result with previous versions. In the documentation we are only talking about the header when it comes to those button positioning classes.

Regarding the first example (the header without text); It is documented that you have to add a `span` with class `ui-title` in the ""Adding buttons to toolbar widgets without heading"" section in the [Toolbar widget API docs](http://api.jquerymobile.com/toolbar/).

First `var` is page ID. Second `var` is page _object_. You need to look inside that _page_ for the `.selector`. `$("".selector"", page)` is a shortened form of `page.find("".selector"")`, e.g. `$(""#pageX"").find("".foo"").on(""click"", clickhandler);`

`$("".selector"", this).on()...` should solve the problem. And if you're using _Single Page Model_, you may need to use `.one(""pagecreate"")` instead of `.on()`.

of firefox it returns to the demo page and if you click again the button to
open the panel you get nothing is opened until you refresh the demo page

as you may know firefox cache always and instead of getting a fresh page
from the server when clicking the browse back button  firefox uses the

one thing i note that when using data-ajax=true or rel=external at the

6842,2013-12-24 23:18:35,"@hellosticky we have a PHP redirect demo. Because of #6843 I can't link to it now, but the source files are here:

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/demos/navigation-php-redirect

The basic structure of the PHP redirect is that you request a page, but the request contains a custom header indicating that you should request another page. Upon encountering the custom header, your client side code requests the other page and displays it. The resulting navigation history is the start page followed by the redirect target page.

If the demo at the above URL meets your needs, please close this issue.
",gabrielschulhof,hellosticky
6842,2013-12-24 23:37:55,"@gabrielschulhof Thanks, I see that it uses a custom header which a pagecontainerload event handler uses to then load. This would be a significant change not only in my application but I'd have to change my application framework also anywhere it redirects.

I'm still unclear whether this reported bug is expected or not? I actually see the correct content (the browser seems to transparently follow the redirect) of the homepage. The only problem is that the browser history is not updated. Is this a limitation of AJAX that it doesn't tell JQM the transparently redirected to page link? Would a better solution instead be to provide some sort of header on _each_ page that is something like ""X-CurrrentLocation"" which then JQM could read? I'm trying to think of a more systemic way that JQM can solve this issue. This sort of header would be much easier for frameworks to implement because there are always hooks to add response headers, and it should be trivial because we always know which request we're processing, so we can just add that URI into the response header. What do you think?
",hellosticky,gabrielschulhof
6842,2013-12-25 04:04:24,"@gabrielschulhof I was able to successfully use your example. I catch all redirects in the framework, convert them to 200 responses and change the Location header to X-Redirect. I had some strange behavior in my framework because the sample code you pointed to might POST back on the redirect, so instead I use:



I would still like to hear your thoughts on JQM taking a different approach on this, because returning a 200 for a redirect breaks HTTP semantics. It seems to me the only problem is JQM doesn't know the indirect redirects that the browser does for the AJAX call - so how about the X-CurrentLocation idea so that all pages return ""who they are,"" and therefore JQM can tell where the browser indirectly redirected to (at least for the final page, which I think is all that matters)?

Another way to ask this: The fact that the widget factory is not an AMD module should not prevent me from being able to refer to it as if it was when the shimming is in place, should it?

Thanks for reporting the issue. I can confirm the warning (IE11/Windows 7). The warning isn't applicable though. In the theme CSS we have rules like this:



So we don't set a _different_ style for `:visited`, but want to make sure that it gets the _same_ style (read: same font color). We could split it up and only set `color` for `:visited` to prevent the warning, but a change like that in the theme CSS can't land in a maintenance release so it would have to wait until 1.5.

Maybe we can completely remove the `:visited` selectors. They were added in a previous version to prevent issues when people are using HTML5 Boilerplate CSS. Now we use selectors with higher specificity, that might not be an issue anymore. Something we have to test.

I had a similar issue with external panels - see #6650 

Happens when you trigger a changepage from an open panel. During the changepage, `activePage` changes from ""old"" to ""new"" page. Inside the panel handler, the panel formatting is applied to `activePage`, so... some things get applied to the old and some to the new page. 

In my case (and yours as far as I can see in the fiddle) - on your old page, ""panel=open"" is still declared. 

Try the fix I committed with #6658. I bet this will also fix your jsbin.

6789,2014-01-10 16:43:14,"@mtamony That's fine. Remember this: Whenever you assign an ID to an element (like `<div id=""something""></div>`) that _something_ must be unique across the entire application, not just any one HTML file. The reason for that is that, with jQuery Mobile, multiple HTML files may end up inside the same document. Since you have internal pages in your document such as



each of those pages must give a different ID to the panels declared inside it, even though the panels contain the same stuff. I've made the IDs of panels unique in http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/1116 and the panels work.

Without `overflow: hidden;` `text-overflow: ellipsis;` won't be applied. So if you set `overflow: visible;` you will indeed not get an ellipsis. But that also means that the text won't be truncated when it should be and the height of the button will grow instead. Maybe this works in your case where even on the smallest screens there is enough space for the text inside your buttons, but this is not a solution that can be used in every case.

The `ui-btn-right` class is only meant for buttons inside a header toolbar. Because that class sets `position: absolute;` the bar won't get the height of the button. Currently the only way of doing this is with custom CSS.

Instead of using an anchor element and then prevent it from being an anchor you better don't use an anchor at all.

The best way to do this is by not using `data-role=""listview""` but adding classes yourself and set styles that aren't set by the framework anymore (because it expects certain markup) in your custom CSS.

Here is a demo: http://jsbin.com/AKOmUxa/90/edit

6774,2013-12-02 13:38:29,"@zzart 

The problem is that you wrap the header, content, and footer in a div. The panel widget looks for those sections and creates a wrapper around them (see http://api.jquerymobile.com/panel/ ""Where panel markup goes in a page""), but only looks for immediate children. I am closing this as not a bug, but we could change the text in the API docs a bit to make this more clear.
",jaspermdegroot,zzart
6770,2013-12-01 08:16:36,"@mtamony 

In case of push and reveal panels the page contents gets wrapped because it needs to transition. In case of an overlay panel we don't need the wrapper. As a solution to mask blinks when opening a panel we manipulate page and wrapper background. See this demo how you can still set background image for the page: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/panel-styling/

3. write a test to make sure there's only one back button

I also agree with @arschmitz that _setOptions() should not be called from _create(). @rmcdaniel you can probably put the contents of _setOptions() into a new function that is called both from _create() and from _setOptions().

This may seem superfluous, but it is important, because this new function would not be part of an inheritance chain the way _setOptions() is, so calling it would have fewer implications.

The problem is that Firefox (and Opera) applies the `:focus` class to anchor elements when you click on it, while other browsers don't. We wrap the collapsible heading in an anchor to turn it into a button.

Here is a test page (without jQuery Mobile) where you can see this behaviour: http://jsbin.com/AKOmUxa/46

It's not a feature to apply this focus style when you click on the collapsible, so we don't want to do this on all browsers. However, we do want the focus style when you use keyboard to navigate to the collapsible, so we can't just unset it.

Thanks for reporting the issues. We will look into it.
",jaspermdegroot,hyunsook
6621,2013-10-18 13:52:37,"@H2Os the problem is that, when you call .enhanceWithin() on your outermost div (`inject`), the code for creating the popup gets run before the code for creating the toolbars (the header and the footer). Now, the popup relocates itself to the end of the page. This means that it relocates itself outside of `inject`. So, when the .enhanceWithin() call starts looking for toolbars to enhance, it no longer finds the ones inside the popup, because the popup is gone to the end of the page.

Only the popup widget does this kind of relocation.

The workaround is to enhance within the popup first: http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/664/edit

Technically this won't be possible for the reveal and push panel as long as we need a wrapper for the page contents. But even if it would be possible I am not in favor of supporting this. The idea of a panel is to temporary display content without the need to leave a page. So users expect to be on the same page as long as the panel is open. Anything else seems very confusing to me. Maybe you can give an example where this doesn't result in bad UI.

This issue is because on ""tap toggle"" fixed toolbars get `position: absolute;`. The footer is outside the page so it's positioned absolute to the body. And because pages have `position: absolute;` as well the body doesn't have the same height as the page.

The only way we can fix this is by using `position: relative;` for pages. That's not a simple change (transitions, etc.) that we can do now, but we will look into that for a future version. As a quickfix I will hide fixed external footers completely instead of just switching to absolute position.

In case of transitions it was a deliberate choice to make pages scroll to top before transitioning, because we didn't see another way to make it work.

Thanks for reporting the issue. I see what you mean and this is indeed a bug in 1.3.
The problem is that we add class `ui-body-e` (the panel theme) to the page and `ui-body-c` (the page theme) to the wrapper around the content of the page. Theme swatch ""e"" comes after ""c"" in the CSS and that is the cause of this issue.

In 1.4 we will still do something similar but we don't use the `ui-body-*` class for both anymore. That resolved this issue. I tested with this page http://jsbin.com/inAdORE/4/edit where the panel has theme ""b"" and the links inherit theme ""a"" from the page. When the panel is open the links don't get the theme ""b"" style.

We are not going to do another maintenance release for 1.3. Until you have upgraded to 1.4 you can add another selector in your theme CSS to fix the bug:



The same for the `:visited`, `:hover`, and `:active` rules.

The original URL is of the form `x-wmapp1:///app/www/external.html`, so of the three slashes two remain after the protocol is stripped off. Thus, I've changed the string manipulation to strip off any and all starting slashes, obviating the subsequent code that strips off the initial slash:

The reason that your example doesn't work is not because `data-role=""fieldcontain""` has been deprecated. It is because `$( ""selector"" ).enhanceWithin();` initializes everything inside the selected element. So the selected element itself won't be enhanced. See http://jsbin.com/AKOmUxa/11/edit

`data-role=""none""` means jQuery Mobile doesn't enhance or style the button so you'll get a native button. That means the default style that the browser applies to it, it does not mean no style at all. In case of iOS this means a rounded button with a gradient. You can use `-webkit-appearance: none;` to avoid the native look that the browser applies.

Note: `input` elements are self-closing. So you shouldn't have `</input>` in your markup. Also, using `table` for layout is bad practise. It's better to use `div` elements for that.

The name of the widget is '''selectmenu''' and the option is '''closeText'''. You have to bind to '''mobileinit''' before you load the framework JS. The option '''closeText''' is meant for screan readers. You don't see it when you hover the button. See http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/424/edit.

6492,2013-09-24 14:44:58,"@PangbornIdentity Thank you for the contribution. I think this could be a good idea however your PR would not work with data-attribute name spacing to make sure your code works with namespacing you should use `$.mobile.getAttribute( element, property )`, this also forces data-id to be persistent for this to work which i don't think makes sense this should either be something like `data-persist=""true""` or check if something else with the same data-id exists and allow it to be anything. 

In addition i think the property to make the wrapper persistent should be something that is set on the widget element not the wrapper element since this is created at run time so you would want to check if the property exists on `this.element` rather then `this._wrapper` 

Im going to close this PR for now because this implementation will not work. However feel free to either update based on my comments or submit another PR based on them and i will either re-open if you update or review new one.

6490,2013-09-25 19:50:17,"@arschmitz so an alternative solution would be to only remove the wrapper if not in use. we can determine this by

2) getting panels outside the page structure
3) all using type push or reveal
4) that arent the same panel, if there are then dont remove

@arschmitz how about the code? Using `:mobile-panel` as selector is because the `ui-panel` class might not be there yet, but then the `ui-panel-display-overlay` class can't be used to check if it's an overlay panel.

6485,2013-09-19 17:58:51,"@applejacko I believe this is because you're using a fixed toolbar. Fixed toolbars work extremely poorly on Android, resulting in all kinds of weird failures.
",gabrielschulhof,applejacko
6485,2013-09-19 22:23:30,"@gabrielschulhof,

This is really bad news for me. My whole app has fixed toolbars and has been in development for over a year, and we're about to ship v1.3. This bug that I filed here is currently my only showstopper.

What are fixed toolbars for if they don't work on Android? I don't understand. Is this explained somewhere?

My app's main page has a movable map in a div right below the menus that responds to touch events. I played around with it, removing the fixed toolbar on that page and rearranging some HTML/CSS, and usually now I can move the map without moving the toolbar, but once in a while, you can end up moving the menus up and out of sight, leaving the app without a menu system in view! (And it's hard to get the menu buttons back, as they're just as unlikely to scroll into view as they were to scroll out of view. I have to catch it just at the right moment, using a trick: moving the map far enough it has to refresh to a new tile, and then flick down quickly over and over so some of the touch events after the map refresh finishes end up moving the whole page down and menus back into view.) And I as a developer know the menu buttons are there, but a user will have no clue. (And it's unacceptable they disappear at all, of course.)

I can't ship like this. Is there any way you all can fix this problem with the fixed toolbar?

And if not, is there anything I can do to keep my menus from floating away when map-drags in my map div become interpreted as whole-screen-drags that drag the menus away?

I'd appreciate any ideas.

Thanks,

Jack

6485,2013-09-27 16:14:01,"@applejacko sorry for a delay in posting this i actually thought i did the other day but apparently forgot to hit the green button. 

the reproducible issue you report sounds very similar to another bug we had in android 2.3 where when you programaticly scroll the page fixed position elements will ""visually"" update however if you check their position with JS they have not moved. this means when you try to click a button in theme its not really there and will not work. to fix this we have a workaround that checks the position in certain cases and then forces them to update to match what you see. 

you can see the code we use for this here : https://github.com/arschmitz/JQM-Swipefix i hope this helps

i would look into this as a potential fix for your issues in 2.3 as far as your issues in newer platforms im afraid without some sort of test case we can debug i'm not sure how much we will be able to help you with this. i have an S4 i test on and i have never observed this behavior 
",arschmitz,applejacko
6485,2013-09-27 17:51:19,"@arschmitz thanks. 

I tried the SwipeFix, with no success.

I see in the instructions that I should include it after the jQuery Mobile script and before I do any event bindings. I include the < script src=""jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.js"" >< /script > last, after all my personal source JS code, as this needs to be included after $(document).bind(""mobileinit""), which I do in my own source code.

So where would SwipeFix.js go in this order?:

< link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.css"" / >
< script src=""jquery-1.9.1.min.js"" >< /script >
// If I put SwipeFix.js here, it's before the jQuery Mobile script (BAD) and before event bindings (GOOD)
< script type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8"" src=""cordova.js"" >< /script >
< script type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8"" src=""MySourceCodeThatDoesEventBindings.js"" > </script >
< !-- This script MUST be after $(document).bind(""mobileinit"", function(), so keep it last here. -- >
< script src=""jquery.mobile-1.3.1.min.js"" >< /script >
// If I put SwipeFix.js here, it's after the jQuery Mobile script (GOOD) but after event bindings (BAD)

I tried both places, with the same result.

Adding an link button to the collapsible heading means having an anchor inside an anchor which means the generated markup is invalid. Even when other elements are used and the markup isn't invalid, a clickable area inside another clickable area should be avoided because you will run into issues on touch devices.

Both options are not available for listview. See the API docs http://api.jquerymobile.com/listview/.

We looked into supporting mini before, but decided not to add it. Because of changes we made for 1.4 you can probably make a basic listview mini by adding class `ui-mini` to the `ul`. Note that this is not a supported feature so you have to resolve CSS issues, if any, by yourself.

We will probably add support for left icon position in a future version. There is already a feature request ticket for this.

The name jQuery Mobile itself is very well-known so we are not thinking about changing this in the near future. However, we are planning on merging the jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile projects at some point. This could affect the name of the framework.

I have considered giving them the same border-radius but decided to make icon-only buttons round because I think it looks better with the round icon disc. Also, the icon-only button is a bit smaller than buttons with text.
You can set the border-radius in the theme CSS or override in your custom CSS. This is how it looks when you give both buttons the same corners http://jsbin.com/ofuhaw/297/edit

Until we made it possible/easy to set an icon color we have to keep the background disc to ensure contrast with the button. When we don't have the disc anymore we can change the size and border-radius to be the same as other buttons. For now we can add an example like yours to our demos.

jQuery Mobile is not only meant for mobile/touch devices. So I wasn't talking about mobile devices with a keyboard. Providing good accessibility on all kind of devices and also to users with visual impairment is an important project goal.

I don't see why you would want to set the focus on a specific option, but it sounds more like you are looking for a way to not have any focus style at all.

Not setting the focus visually is an option in the framework, but not one you can set via JS. The focus style is part of the theme CSS which you can customize/override to your own liking.

6352,2013-08-18 11:45:12,"Thanks @frequent.

I think the collapsible set widget is not the the right base for tabs, because there are more differences between the two UI components than just horizontal versus vertical. One thing is that with tabs I would expect that there is always one tab visible/open. I also think that they are meant for different purposes and length of content. Accordions should only contain short pieces of content for example. So it's questionable if falling back from tabs to accordions on small screens should be desired.

Besides this it looks like it's impossible to get the width of the content right with the collapsible set markup because of rounding issues when using percentages. The lack of support for IE8 would also be a problem and we can't use data- attributes in our CSS because we support namespacing.

Saving a widget by adding a new feature via an option in an existing widget is actually not a benefit. In a custom download I would get all collapsible tabs CSS while I might not even use it. Maybe it's a small change when adding it, but sooner or later options require additional JS or CSS to deal with exceptions when we want to change something or have to fix an issue. We actually want to reduce options.

So we are going to stick with UI tabs, also because this fits in the project goal of making all widgets work in both frameworks. We didn't add CSS for UI tabs to keep it as flexible as possible. You can add a body theme class to the content to style it. I am going to close this PR, but wanted to give some feedback which could also be useful when you work on other new features

In 1.3 we only scroll to top if the bottom of the panel content wasn't in view, but decided that it is better when the top of the panel content is always in view when opening a panel so we changed it to always scroll to top (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5858).

Thanks for the feedback. In 1.3 we started with the Demo Center where we add demos to show how to customize styles. Especially demos that show how to override/customize widgets where we use more complex CSS  We have to update this for 1.4 and will keep adding new ones.

The add the ui-btn-left and -right classes to the buttons that position them absolute. Those classes are designed for the header. If you want to use them in the footer you have to use some custom CSS to set `top: auto;` and `bottom: 5px;` for example. This is not something we are going to include in the framework CSS.

See https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues how to report an issue. Always include a test page.
Your `bind()` code example is incorrect. See the jQuery documentation.
In your last example with `on()` the handler will be executed if the `pageinit` event is coming from a page with an ID of ""page_1"". That should work, so if it doesn't you can create a test page using our JS Bin template to illustrate the issue.
If you use `$( document ).on( ""pageinit"", function() { });`` the handler will be executed each time a page is initialized, no matter what page.

Thanks. I agree it would be nice to offer flexibility regarding the position of the button. However, I think we should go for a differrent approach.
For 1.4 we started with adding option `enhanced` to widgets which allows the developer to add the markup instead of having the framework generating it. This hasn't been done for the table widget yet, but when this has been added it should allow you to place the button in the header and add a position class (`ui-btn-left|right`).
An option ""target"" would mean the framework has to add a position class in case the target is the header and do a check if the button slots are already in use, etc.. Maybe we would have to add similar checks for other possible targets. This is not good for performance.

Thanks for the issue report. This is a known limitation.
For 1.4 we worked on reducing DOM manipulation to improve performance. One change is that we no longer wrap button elements in a div. The only downside is that we have to set `width: 100%;` for the button (unless inline). Because of that it can't have margin left/right.

I made a change so we don't call `_wrapper()` in case of an overlay panel. We don't need to wrap page contents for this display mode because only the panel animates. That will resolve the issue on your test page. However, can't be fixed for the reveal and push display modes. In that case we need to use `.wrapAll()` and this seems to trigger a refresh of iFrames on some browsers. I read something about this on StackOverflow and the jQuery core bug tracker and it doesn't seem to be a jQuery bug but wrong behaviour of those browsers.

I looked into it again and we can't transition `ui-content`. The reason is that we set a background to the element we transition and make it inherit the height from the page. That means that a footer (not fixed) will be pushed down.

This has changed for 1.4. They are widget events now, but triggering them won't work anymore. You can now use `.collapsible( ""expand|collapse"" );`.

We change the `type` attribute from ""search"" to ""text"" during enhancement to prevent native clear buttons and add the framework clear button. This way you have a consistent result on all browsers.

If we make it optional, we probably have to add an option whether to hide the native clear button yes or no. Another thing is the default value for the option `clearBtn` which is `false` while we would want this to be `true` for search inputs.

I don't agree. All size and position related CSS is in the structure CSS files. There shouldn't be any widget specific rules in the theme CSS. If you have custom build and don't use popup (arrow) you don't want rules for that in your CSS.

I think it would be cool to add a page to the demo center where you can change popup arrow CSS with range inputs and directly see the result. Then you can change the values in your own build or add overrides.

The `mobileinit` event is fired as soon as jQuery Mobile starts so you have to bind your event handler before you load jQuery Mobile JS and use `.on()`. This event is useful for configuring defaults.

Default:
- inline SVG + external PNG: jquery.mobile.icons.css + jquery.mobile.theme.css + jquery.mobile.structure.css = jquery.mobile.css

Additional files to be used with loader script:
- inline SVG: jquery.mobile.icons.data.svg.css + jquery.mobile.theme.css + jquery.mobile.structure.css = jquery.mobile.data.svg.css
- data-uri PNG: jquery.mobile.icons.data.png.css + jquery.mobile.theme.css + jquery.mobile.structure.css = jquery.mobile.data.png.css
- external PNG: jquery.mobile.icons.fallback.css + jquery.mobile.theme.css + jquery.mobile.structure.css = jquery.mobile.fallback.css

These are the current filenames. I suggest to rename the icon source and the destination files:
- data.svg.css --> svg.css
- data.png.css --> data-png.css
- fallback.css --> png.css

A destination file name like ""jquery.mobile.svg.css"" might be a bit confusing though. Like it only contains the icon CSS. Suggestions?

The default CSS is already working fine, because we only added an @import rule. The additional files work the same, the destination files with @import rules are on the repo. We have to build those CSS files (unminified and minified) and add them to the ZIP and CDN.

I think we also have to include the icon source files (unminified and minified) in the ZIP and upload the to the CDN. That means another 8 files :/

`buttonMarkup` is a function and not a widget so there is no `_setOptions()`. That's why your code doesn't work. 

For anchors with `data-role=""button""` and button elements you can use this code to change the option:



Inputs with `type=""button|submit|reset""` use the button widget so you can use this:



When we only need to add or remove classes to/from the native element, just using a function is much better for performance than using a widget. So we only use the widget if we need to do more during enhancement, like wrapping the native element in `div`. That's the case with `input` because otherwise we can't add icons.

Note that for `button` things changed. Before 1.4 we were wrapping them so they used the widget. As from 1.4 we don't do this anymore so we just use `buttonMarkup()`.

I could reproduce the problem on iPad. This is an iOS bug that we can't fix. I tested with this page without jQuery Mobile and you see the same problem: http://jsbin.com/edeluh/11. Even triggering a redraw didn't resolve it. Seems like webview uses the full screen as viewport after returning from the camera app, while it should take the space for the clock into account. The problem will only be visible if you have a header with position fixed.

The `ui-btn-left` and `ui-btn-right` classed are used to position buttons in the header. If you want to do something similar in the footer you have to use custom CSS. The easiest way is probably adding rule `.ui-footer .ui-btn-right { top: auto; bottom: .375em; }`.

Supporting this would also mean we have to make sure those buttons are not on top of footer text or a navbar, if present. We can't do that properly in the framework with just CSS. From  a performance point of view it's not a good idea to use a JS solution while it can be easily achieved with just a bit custom CSS. So we are not going to add this feature.

In latest code we do not add a class for the hover state anymore but just apply a style for `:hover`. So this should not be an issue anymore. If you still see the problem with latest code it is a bug in MSIE's high contrast feature.

Now that I have seen a screenshot (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6123#issuecomment-20352448) of what this high contrast feature does I also understand why you don't see hover effect. It's not related to how we apply the style, it's just that MSIE with that feature enabled kills all the style.

Changing border-width on hover is probably not a good idea because it will affect the position of the surrounding elements. High contrast border colors for `:hover` and `:active` inside a media query that targets IE with this feature enabled could be a solution.

I suggest we keep only one ticket (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6123) open for all MSIE high contrast mode issues.

The framework wraps the `input` element in a `div` with class `ui-input-text` during enhancement. The border, background and shadow styles are applied to this `div`. With `.children()` you target this wrapper, not the input. You can use `.ui-input-text` as selector when calling `.hide()` and `.show()`. We are also working on making it possible to add your own classes or ID to the generated wrapper by adding a data- attribute to the input element.

We were adding a ""hidden"" class, but only for button/submit inputs. I removed that in branch ""next"" because we can just use something like `.ui-input-btn > input`. Only thing we have to think about is that when we add an option to handle all markup yourself; this would also hide the native input on a C-grade browser.
Hiding the native input/select element has to be done differently for almost all form widgets so I don't think we should use a generic class here.

This is a 1.2.0 test page: http://jsbin.com/ayumal/8/edit. It doesn't throw an error but the checkbox isn't enhanced either. The reason you get an error with 1.3.0 has not to do with changes in jQuery Mobile, but the different jQuery core version you are using (the error is only with core >= 1.8.x).

I guess we would have to look for square brackets, dots and colons in ID's and escape them with double backslash to prevent this problem.

You can use jQuery Mobile 1.3.x with jQuery core 1.7.2: http://jsbin.com/ayumal/12/edit

Unfortunately, I cannot use the approach you are proposing since my use case is slightly different from @akc42's.

In my case the initial page has loaded completed and fired pageshow. After (!) pageshow I want to auto-open a dialog _on top of_  the initial page (I added some transparency to the background around the dialog so that the initial page is still visible in the back) so that the user can enter some missing data. When the user has completed this dialog, he should arrive back at the initial page.

http://jsfiddle.net/ZmcP8/15/ shows exactly what I am trying to do (no more onload). The dialog keeps on auto-closing in my Chome 26.0.1410.65.

6042,2013-06-06 10:54:21,"@arschmitz I can see what you are doing - and it might work in my case.

However its not very elegant.  the page with id = ""Calls"" is the default page for the application and all I am doing is if the user is not logged on putting up the dialog box to enable him to logon.  Once he has, and providing the cookie doesn't expire (currently when he closes the browser, but I don't want to limit it to that) all subsequent calls to the default page will not display the dialog and should just display as normal.  Indeed my code actually removes the whole logon dialog from the DOM.

I could change your example to test the cookie in the pagebeforeload event so it is a potential solution, but ...

I think you miss the point, or maybe I just don't understand the code well enough.  This isn't about why I am trying to open the dialog when I am, what I am saying is that I think the logic for handling a potential popstate event just after the write to windows.location.hash on line 2482 of jquery-mobile 1.3.1 seems to be wrong. The example I provided illustrates the problem, I made the problem go away with the patch I suggested (and that is why I think the logic is wrong) but when I did that much of the other sections of the logic didn't seem to make sense, and trials with lots of console.log statements  showed much of the logic wasn't being used (in either Firefox or Chrome). It needs someone who understands what that section of code is trying to do to confirm whether or not I have understood it properly. 

Closing the report is a sticking plaster, not a solution.

`buttonMarkup` is a function that is called by many widgets to create the markup for button styled elements (listview buttons, selectmenu, etc.). It is not a widget, so it doesn't have a `disable` or `refresh` method.

Form buttons (`button` and `input` type button/submit/reset elements) use the button widget. In this widget there is a call to `buttonMarkup()`. The button widget does have `disable` and `refresh` methods. So this works: http://jsbin.com/axileq/4/edit. Note that in this case there is no need to refresh.

Our button widget API documentation is wrong/confusing: http://api.jquerymobile.com/button/
It also contains information about styling links as buttons. `anchor` elements with `data-role=""button""` don't use the button widget. They don't use any widget at all, we just use `buttonMarkup()` to style them, so this information doesn't belong there.
I see there is already a ticket for this issue (https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/85) and will comment there.

The ""expand"" and ""collapse"" events were only meant for internal use. I think most of all to make the collapsible set work. That's also why they were never documented. However, because there was no other way to dynamically expand or collapse a collapsible people started using this event and we also showed this solution in a demo.

So you should indeed revert to `.collapsible(""option"", ""collapsed"", false);` as soon as this is part of the release. There is a ticket (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5798) to use the Widget Factory for the ""expand"" and ""collapse"" events (instead of simply triggering them) and document them. But that's about firing the event and does not mean we keep binding to them.

The way I read it (and I verified by testing), when you set the option to true (default), the option will be bypassed and the taphold will not emit a tap (which is fine by me but would be a breaking change as you explained):



If you set the option to false, then tap will never be triggered which would be a bigger issue. Here is some code to set the option as you want (I'd prefer not making it optional personally as it makes the code heavier and complicated even though I understand your argument):



I am preparing a new pull request to fix this issue and fix an edge case when the taphold event is bound to a link, a mouseup event will still be triggered by propagation and will lead to the link being opened after the taphold is triggered. This can be avoided by using  `event.stopPropagation()`.

Since 1.3.0 we wrap the text input in a div because we added the clear button option. Because we have to set padding right on the div for the clear button it was easier (read: less CSS required) to set the left/right padding on the div instead of the input in general.

I'm about to release my app, so I don't want to switch to 1.4 - which is still in Alpha too.

I'm thinking, the way to fix this MAYBE is to just override the ""hover"" and ""down"" CSS styles to match the ""up"" style perhaps. I'm not a CSS guy, but I suppose I'm gonna have to be for this one little annoying bug. I don't know what else to try.

Update: After typing the above, I tried the 1.4 Alpha. It seems to have made things worse, because clicking on the label no longer changes it to white. So it REALLY gets stuck on gray.
",applejacko,ryanmaxwell
5973,2013-08-22 22:45:28,"@ryanmaxwell 

I ended up doing a CSS override, making the hover style match the up style (made the definition of .ui-btn-hover-c be the same as that for .ui-btn-up-c). And style ""c"" is used as the default in jQM in checkboxes, so there was no need to dress up tags around my checkboxes with data-theme=""c"" anywhere. Works well. 

(OK, I get no hovering indication on a Galaxy Note II which has stylus hovering sensing, but I can live without it. So basically, looks like the hover style was getting stuck from time to time.

My guess - and I could be completely wrong here - is that the checkbox widgetry worked and works great on a desktop browser, but there's something someone didn't quite catch or think about when porting it to mobile. Some combination of mobile events - that never happens on Desktopland - is keeping the hover stuck on in mobile browsers in some instances. I've even seen multiple shades of gray when I had a room full of testers! So I guess the style was being applied...twice or more. (???) I think I have a screenshot somewhere, if the tester that made that happen emailed it to me...

Thanks for reporting the issue.

For 1.4 we are working on reducing the markup we generate for buttons, including the ones in listviews. As a result the anchor element in the list item will get the button classes, including the active state class. This resolves this issue.
It also means we can remove the code that was added (cb54f03) to fix the same issue we had with popups (#4611).

The `ui-btn-active` class is removed when the process of opening the panel is finished, so there is no need to use a timeout here.
The 300ms timeout we use in the popup widget was not part of the fix for #4611, but was added earlier (e612aa8). I am not completely sure why we choose to use a timeout.
@gabrielschulhof can't we remove the active state class on `popupafteropen`?

It's actually a combination of issues:

@gnarf37 @gseguin - Can you guys look into the 404/500 errors of the demos on view.jquerymobile.com? See also https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5939 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5937.

Besides that there is a problem with all JPG's in the Demo Center of the 1.3.1 build. See https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5934#issuecomment-17005767. You can look at http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/demos/ instead of http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/.

This ""swipe page"" demo still won't work on http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/demos/examples/swipe/newyork.html and doesn't work local either. You'll get a `Cannot read property 'prefetch' of undefined` error. This is a bug in the framework and probably a regression from this commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/be22887a37d1e5eb8d9090c59d71912bd93b6a8c.

Thanks for this suggestion. I agree it would be nice if we could leave this up to the developer.

Downside of your solution is that it uses JS to add a class, while we are actually working on reducing this in 1.4 to improve performance. Another problem is the `:not()` selector which isn't supported on IE8. Media queries aren't supported either on IE8, but when people use a polyfill like Respond.js they probably expect things to work.

What I have in mind for field containers is to do the responsiveness the other way around and use class `ui-responsive`, the same way as we do for responsive grids. The labels and form elements sit next to eachother by default and we use the following CSS to stack them at small screens:



Or maybe also `.ui-responsive .ui-field-contain` so you only have to add the `ui-responsive` class to the form container and not each field container in the form.

The rule to apply this at all viewport widths for field containers in popups can be done the same way. That would resolve the problem you described, because you can just omit class `ui-responsive`.
Using an opt-in class and doing it the other way around also makes it a lot easier if you want to use a different breakpoint. Obvious downside is that you have to add that class to your markup if you want things to stay the same as they are now.

You are right. You can add class `ui-responsive-panel` to the page to apply the framework presets (see the next paragraph). If you add the rules from the CSS example to your custom CSS using the `ui-responsive-panel` is not needed. I will remove it from the example.

Re: disabling dismiss at wider screens. In our example we show how it's done for panels with display mode ""push"". If you don't use those, but panels with display mode ""reveal"" you can indeed use class `ui-panel-dismiss-display-reveal`. I will add another example, so we have one example that shows how you can disable it for all modes and one how to do this for a specific mode.

Thanks!

To do this only for ""push"" mode is intentional. The ""overlay"" and ""reveal"" panels are on top / underneath the page and are similar to a popup, from a UI perspective. A ""push"" panel is at the same level as the page, which makes them a bit different. That's why we choose to only allow interactions with the page for the ""push"" mode in the preset.

I strongly recommend to always bind to `pageinit`, instead of `$(handler)` or `$(document).ready(handler)`. There are situations where it doesn't make a difference, but better make a habit of it.

As @vstars pointed out, the problem here is indeed the selectmenu dialog page that remains in the DOM, only the list is removed from the dialog.

The dialog that is created gets the same ID as your select with the ""-dialog"" suffix. You create a new select with the same ID each time the button on the homepage is clicked. The framework doesn't create a new dialog a second time because there is already a dialog with that ID. If you don't give the select an ID, the dialog gets a random ID `uuid-[random number]-dialog` and the problem is gone: http://jsbin.com/owasir/28/edit

However, this way you can end up with many dialogs in the DOM which is not good. So a better workaround is to remove the dialog with custom code. See: http://jsbin.com/owasir/29/edit

not sure I understand. You want multiple filtering functions to be applied to a single list? The other way around makes more sense to me (= use a single filter on multiple element-containers, e.g. triggering a filter on a listview would also filter elements in another listview).

If you want to do something like this, it's quite easy. Add an attribute to the remote list you want to have filtered and inside the JQM listview filter, add list items of the remote list to the overall selection of items to be filtered using the attribute you set on the remote list. I'm using this quite a lot, so if you need an example, let me know. 
",frequent,dueckes
5930,2013-04-29 00:29:22,"@frequent:

I arrived at my latest suggestion after implementing an interface with multiple ways of filtering a list (or multiple controls where, when any control changes, the same list must update).

So, for example, the list has the standard search input filtering by name _and an additional_ radio group filtering on another significant attribute.  This type of requirement will be more probable in cases where each list item has a very rich data-set and the result-set is fairly large - users will be more inclined to narrow results based on numerous attributes.

My suggestion arose as it is difficult to support multiple controls filtering the list given the current filter / search implementation.  It has two limitations:
1. There is no method exposed to trigger filtering of the overall list.  This logic appears to be embedded in the _onKeyUp function in listview.filter.js.
2. The _onKeyUp method is designed to solely support the search filter control as it will **show or hide
   the entire list** when the search input is empty.

Consequently, my suggestion was to:
1.  Expose a filter method that could be used as an event callback by any additional control filtering the list.  For example, filtering could then be triggered on change of a radio group value.
2.  Remove the logic that shows or hides the entire list when the search input is empty and leave it to the filterCallback to decide what is shown.

This suggestion is predicated on the logic that considers all the filters being in the filterCallback method.

To make my suggestion more concrete, here's something I threw together in an attempt to patch the existing behaviour (in CoffeeScript):



As the _onKeyUp method interfere's with the approach I have suggested, I unbind the callback before binding the new solution.

The patch can be used like so (again CoffeeScript):

Here is a [jsPerf test](http://jsperf.com/delegated-vs-object/4) that shows the difference (thanks @gabrielschulhof for setting up the test!).

What we test here is the processing time; the responsiveness. The test shows that our current code is much faster than the code from your PR.
It's not very likely that there are many close links in a panel, otherwise we should also consider the difference in attaching time. Your code probably results in a faster startup.

Re: a standard way to treat close links. For 1.4/1.5 we are focussing on improving performance and reviewing all widgets. In widgets where we treat close links differently we can look into doing it the same way as we do for panels.
However, performance is not the only thing we have to look at. For example, if the issue you reported couldn't be fixed with a refresh method we should have merged your PR. So there might never be one standard way.

Good point about the next event binding in the `_bindCloseEvents` function in the panel widget. We should look into improving that when we review the panel widget.

In general: when you add `data-role=""[widgetname]""` to an element the framework will enhance it during initialization. If you then call the plugin and set options (read: change options) you have to call the `refresh` method of the widget as well.

The panel in that fiddle has `data-role=""panel""` on it. If you leave that out you should be able to set the display option when you call `panel()`. If you want to change the option on-the-fly you have to call the `refresh` method, BUT... the panel widget doesn't have this method yet :(

5918,2013-08-15 11:52:00,"@arschmitz The reason for the error is that you were calling `this._superApply( options );` from `_setOption()`. `_superApply` is just like `apply` in that you need to pass in an array of arguments. Most often you'll want `this._superApply( arguments );`.

Also, I don't believe you need to implement `_setOption` if you've implemented `_setOptions` because the widget factory always calls `_setOption` from `_setOptions` and it processes `.widgetname( ""option"", ""optionName"", newValue )` via `_setOptions`. So, even if a single option is changed, it still calls `_setOptions()` with a hash containing a single key.

This is because a slide gesture is also a swipe gesture when you do it fast. When you slide slow it won't happen, but of course a user doesn't know that.
We have to look into what is the best way to prevent this, performance-wise. Maybe it can be done with custom code so we can resolve this by providing a demo.

`data-dismissible` is not relevant here, because that only defines whether the panel should be closed or not when clicking or swiping on the page contents.

How you even may compare performance of `:not(.ui-collapsible-collapsed)` selector (even it's slowest) with

Filtering based on selector will be >100 times faster and this is visible even in a Desktop browser - try with 100 collapsibles set.

I have several topic related to performance too. Will try describe in few words:

On our side we work with large data and most critical topic is generating `collapsibleset` and `listview`.
Optimization that we use here (for example, in `collapsibleset`):
- Clone `collapsible` widget (without re-creating and refreshing) and change only necessary data (all this done with [knockoutjs](http://knockoutjs.com/) bindings),
- Implement `collapsible` events handling in `collapsibleset` (delegated handling).

With this we have good performance and only one problem exists - always big deal to update jQueryMobile to latest version.

May be you have ideas how implement delegated handling for `collapsibleset` and `listview` in jQueryMobile.

If this topic interesting I may spend time to prepare real example for this.

That is still the case, but using a widget just to set options of its children to the same value is not a good idea from a performance point of view.
Every option we add affects the performance of a widget. We actually want to reduce options in widgets and only add them if we don't see any other solution.
As from 1.4 we use CSS for theme inheritance so you could wrap your individual collapsibles in a div with class `ui-group-theme-x` and they will all inherit theme ""x"".

It's not true that the header works exactly like the footer. The framework adds the `ui-btn-left|right` class to the first two anchor elements in the header. Those two buttons are positioned absolute. Because your header doesn't contain a heading the third button ends up underneath the first.
See http://api.jquerymobile.com/header/ ""Custom header configurations"" about using a header that doesn't follow the default configuration. If you wrap the buttons in a `div` you'll get the desired result: http://jsbin.com/owasir/13/edit

The `ui-hidden-accessible` class is provided to hide labels. That being said, it might be a good idea to make it possible to use this class to hide the native inputs and make the slider full width.
Note that full width means including the handle. We can't make the slider track full width because the handle shouldn't stick out when you slide it to the beginning or end of the track.
Currently the width of the track is based on the regular sized handle. We could adjust the width a bit for the mini slider.
We look into consistency of the margin between label and form element as well. 

Added regular size slider to test page for comparison: http://jsbin.com/umafuw/2/edit

5846,2013-04-03 08:30:57,"@DzenisevichK 

This is a deliberate choice. With the slider, the role of the native input is primarily giving feedback. We styled them accordingly.
I understand that when you unset the box-shadow you might want a subtle border and/or background instead (http://jsbin.com/ijuhuy/2/edit). To keep it subtle it has to be adjusted to the background color of the page,so this is something you would have to style in your custom CSS.

As I tried to explain in my first comment, we styled them differently because of the different role of the input when the slider handle is there as primary control. Especially on small screens and in case of a dual handle slider we think it's better when the input has a different style. It's not just the border. We also reduced the size, removed the background gradient and made the font bold.

I just made a little change to make it easier to restore the border if you want. You can now set `border-width: 1px;` for the input to get it back. See http://jsbin.com/ijuhuy/4/edit

5831,2013-04-04 14:44:14,"Hi jasper,

Much better! :) except i still see occasionally flickering. If u scroll the content on the main page all the way down, it briefly shows the background ( you know that box that says ""edit on js""). I think thats what happened previously too, the background page is showing briefly. I'm going to test further with my actual content though to be sure. Do i need to update the css or js files from 1.3.0 for the fix?

One more thing though, i'm using fixed-positioning panel. Half way down the content, the panel shows only half way down also. It doesn't show from the very top. Think this is another issue.

Thanks a lot jasper. Much appreciated.

Thanks for the quick reply.
I added a rule to hide that ""edit in JS Bin"" label: http://jsbin.com/alofim/8
If you want to do more testing, use latest code (see the links in the head of that JS Bin).

Re: fixed positioning. We unfix the panel if the content is larger than the viewport to make sure the user can scroll the panel content. Right now we only scroll to top if no panel content is in view. Maybe we should change this logic in 1.4 and always scroll to top when opening a panel that doesn't have fixed position (anymore).

The heading of a collapsible is enhanced as button and what you try to do it having another button inside it. That results in a very bad UI. If you remove the 100% width inline style that you added to the `select` you get a working example but you will also notice that clicking on the select button also expands/collapse the collapsible: http://jsbin.com/ukewu3/336
That is why this is not supported and the generated markup is actually invalid.

Also note that you use `.on()` which has been introduced in jQuery 1.7 but load version 1.6.1. That is why your test didn't work. Latest version of jQuery Mobile supports jQuery core 1.8.0 - 1.9.1.

About the last button in the group not gettting rounded corners, this is because...
1. you wrap the button in a `label`
2. you use a `label` for an `anchor` element
It has not to do with the mini option.

Re 1: I will add a note to the API docs that when you use labels for `button` or `input type=""button""` elements in controlgroups, you shouldn't wrap them, but associate the `label` with the form element by using the `for` attribute.
In that case you'll get the expected result because we hide the labels in a way they are only accessible by screen readers. See http://jsbin.com/atarer/16

Re 2: Html specs: `The LABEL element may be used to attach information to controls. Each LABEL element is associated with exactly one form control.`. An `anchor` is not a form element so we don't expect it to have a `label` and don't support this.

Also note that single buttons and grouped buttons have different corner radii. You can change this in your theme CSS or in the ThemeRoller if you use that tool.

In 1.3 we wrap the text input in a `div` because we added the option to have a clear button.

First, thanks for the PR! 

It sounds like you're proposing we avoid executing the `enhance` method depending on what widgets are in the page. If you look at the enhance method below, you'll see that nothing really happens if no elements match the initSelector. That is, if there are no elements in the page that the widget handles it won't really do anything.

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.widget.js#L46



You could make the case that we can eliminate some function calls but the performance win would be pretty minimal relative to the expensive dom manipulations that take place.

It's also possible I've completely misunderstood what you're proposing! In that case, where performance is concerned it would be good to have a jsperf sample to show the performance improvement / expectation / environment. (http://jsperf.com)

5784,2013-03-20 04:26:31,"@johnbender, First, thanks for your kind comment. :)

My proposal executes the same enhance method as jQM does.
Even if there are no elements in the Web page, all of $.widget() methods in widget's IIFEs are parsed and compiled by JS engine and all of widgets' binders call enhance().

JS engines pratically take time to parse and compile JS function more than we know.
So my team wanted to reduce the parsing and compilation time and enhance() method call count.
If we change $.widget() method call to a variable, JS engine doesn't parse and compile it. So, eventually, we can reduce Web App's launching time.

We are planning on making changes for 1.4 to use pseudo classes for hover, down and focus style instead of adding classes. See #5173. We will make sure a disabled button doesn't get those styles.

A button gets the active state while there is some sort of action in progressing (e.g. loading a new page). Of course I don't know your use case (business logic), but disabling a button at that moment sounds like giving wrong feedback to the user. So I wouldn't recommend doing this and don't see a need to fix this is in the framework, but if you still want/need to do this you would have remove the `ui-btn-active` class when you programmatically disable the button.

I completely agree that this would be better for shorter panels, if they are too long, it could be confusing. I do think we need to support variable heights, and even multiple top panels on the same page, each with different heights.

Ideally, we'd script this so the plugin would measure the panels' height before opening and set the css as needed. We'd need to calculate this when opening because the person could change orientations and the height may shift due to reflow or different styles being applied.

A bottom version would be suoer slick too, but let's see how much work it will be to get the top one working with variable heights first.

Thanks for your post!

If you use this solution you would also have to remove the faux placeholder to prevent it from being submit as value. I would also suggest to change the font color (`#aaa` is common) while a value is used as placeholder, but I suppose you add the placeholder class for that purpose. To avoid the script to run while the native placeholder attribute is supported you can add a support test (http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/detect.html#input-placeholder).

I don't think we should include this solution in the framework by default. First reason is that it adds code weight while it's only needed if you use placeholders and have to support browsers like IE9. Second reason is that many devs use a form validation check and this code will probably interfere with that.

Would be great to add this as a demo (http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/examples/) though. Do you feel like creating a PR for that? Thanks!

Thanks for your post!

Changing this setting for WebKit browsers might cause blinks, but since it's a Firefox issue you could just set `-moz-transform: none;`.

The same for a left panel:



Going to test this. If there is no downside we can land this solution in 1.3.1.

I suppose the bug will also appear when you have a select in the page content. By default option `dismissible` is set to `true` so you can't interact with the page anyway while the panel is open. But when you set this to false `the problem will occur.
Same goes for when you use class`ui-responsive-panel`with a push panel, because in that case we hide the dismiss layer that prevents interaction at wider screens.
We can't fix this because in this case the`transform`is`translate3d(17em,0,0)``` (or -17em).

5753,2013-04-05 10:29:07,"@jaxtheking 

Firefox doesn't use the `-webkit` prefix, but the override works the other way around. So this seems like a good solution. FF 16+ that supports the non-prefixed will still support the `-moz` prefix as well I suppose. By putting the `-moz` property after the non-prefixed one it will override the value we set there. Going to change this for 1.3.1.

5735,2013-03-13 03:39:24,"@gabrielschulhof, yeah I know that it's ultimately a behaviour of the mobile browsers.

However, we're talking about a popup dialog here.  Since the browser doesn't know it is a popup dialog (it just appears to be part of the page from it's perspective), it's default behaviour is probably not what users are expecting in the context of a popup. 

It would be good if jQuery Mobile could provide some work-arounds so the popup dialogs are still useable in this situation. It's really bad user experience to have the dialog move out of view in this way after closing the keyboard.

So, I agree - this is not a bug. But perhaps still something jQuery Mobile should look at dealing with to improve the popups?

We force hardware acceleration to get smooth animations by ""3D-ing"" panel and page contents. You can prevent the issue by doing the same for your searchbar. See the style in the head here: http://jsbin.com/icayam/5/edit

It looks like jQuery's show/hide method is also animating the width of the search input. This causes the input to blink on iOS. Also ""3D-ing"" the input is probably too much, you might run into performance issues. I suggest you look into preventing this animation.

Closing this issue as resolved.
",jaspermdegroot,abampakos
5734,2013-03-06 11:06:40,"@abampakos

If you do not wait until the initial popstate event has fired _and_ its stack has been unwound to do any navigation, you won't get a new history entry!

You can play around with a failsafe timeout to simulate the initial popstate event on _normal_ browsers, but if the timeout fires before the initial popstate (because the system is busy or whatever), the browser won't add the history entry: http://jsbin.com/ulapiq/2/edit

About the close button. It's common to have it positioned like that for photo popups, etc.. That's why we made it easy  to achieve this by just adding the `ui-btn-right` class.

So if this is what you meant, then I can reproduce :-) 

@uGoMobi Is that something that we can look at? Outside of popups, tapping/clicking outside of a previously selected (in focus) input field, tapping/clicking outside of that input field will cause it not to be in focus anymore. However, inside the popup, this is not happening. So if you have tapped/clicked inside a form element inside a popup, clicking outside of that form element in the popup will not allow this input field to lose focus (except if you click inside another form element on the popup, but then the problem is just passed to another form element, and so not resolved)

The difference is that the text input is now wrapped in a `div` because we added the clear button feature. This also means that the `ui-body-c`class, that defines the border color, is added to the `div` and not to the `input` element.
I don't see why you would need to do mobile detection to change the border color. You can simply add this to your custom CSS:

Checking if the textarea is disabled on each keyup might not be a good idea, but adding logic to the `disable` and `enable` methods to remove/add the extra line is probably acceptable.

See the API documentation http://api.jquerymobile.com/popup/ section ""Positioning options"". The second point at ""popup's placement constraints"" about tolerance.
In this JS Bin I set tolerance 0 to override the default and the popup is placed at the given x and y coordinate: http://jsbin.com/ipuhab/6/edit
Note that the given coordinates will be used as _center_ of the popup (although it won't be placed off the screen when you set 0).

Confirmed. Nexus 7 still chuggy with transitions even when panels are not
present on page. Please test yourself, but I believe it is likely to be the
same issue that was fixed between v1.1 and v1.2..  Please see previous

Using `display: none;` for the panel has downsides. One of them is that we want to know the height of the panel contents before opening the panel, e.g. to check if we need to unfix fixed panels. With `display: none;` we can't do that. Anyway, I will look into the issues you reported.

This is a configurable option. See http://api.jquerymobile.com/collapsible/#option-collapseCueText.
There you see how to set it programmatically.
Like all widget options it also works if you set this with a data- attribute: `data-collapse-cue-text` and `data-expand-cue-text`: http://jsbin.com/ariqas/2/edit
I noticed that those are not listed in the data- attribute reference http://api.jquerymobile.com/data-attribute/ so we have to add this.
The cue text is appended to the header text as a hidden span because it is meant to give audible feedback. We will look into the WAI-ARIA attribute that you suggested.

5645,2013-02-15 14:58:15,"@thinframe 

This has to do with the tap toggle function. When you click on the page, we set `position: absolute;` instead of `fixed` for the toolbars. You will notice this behaviour on this page that has more content: http://jsbin.com/erezak/25
So removing/adding that class is on purpose. If you don't want this you can set `data-tap-toggle=""false""`.

The problem is that we pull fixed footers 1px down to fix a 1px gap issue on Android. We also set 1px padding-bottom to keep the same visual height.
This is causing the text to jump 1px when we switch to `position: absolute;` on a short page (no scroll): http://jsbin.com/erezak/27

Other issue is that the border is not visible with  `position: fixed;`, but becomes visible with `position: absolute;`

5642,2013-02-14 10:20:21,"@nschonni 

Thanks for the PR. Here is my feedback.
- `-moz-border-radius`: We just removed this from the CSS because we support Firefox 4+ which supports the unprefixed property.
- `-moz-appearance`: I think we added `-webkit-appearance: none;` to those two rules for hiding the native element to resolve an issue on an older WebKit browser. Hiding the element works fine on Firefox and Firefox for Android so there is no need to add this.
- `-o-` prefixed transitions: The framework only enables transitions if a platform/browser supports 3D transforms. That is to be sure that all transitions will work (not just the 2D) and that they will animate smooth. Opera doesn't support 3D transforms so we didn't add this. See #4521.
- `-ms-` prefixed transitions: IE supports transitions from IE10 and doesn't require the prefix (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673535(v=vs.85).aspx). We added the unprefixed properties in 1.3 to support transitions on IE10. `-ms-` is superfluous.

`transform: translate3d(0,0,0);` isn't needed there. This rule is there to force mobile WebKit browsers to use hardware acceleration. This trick isn't needed for Firefox or IE so we only use the `-webkit` prefixed property.

The only button with theme ""a"" on that page is the one at the top of the left nav menu. The reason that button keeps the active state after you click on it, is that it links to the same page. Normally clicking a link means navigating away from the page and the framework removes the active button class on `pagehide`. That event doesn't fire in this case.

You say ""it's working"" on Windows Safari and Chrome. I see same behaviour on those browsers though. Did I misunderstood the issue?

@arschmitz, @uGoMobi: it shouldn't be difficult to continue with the code I did. I'm more or less replacing elements with hardcoded tags (parent: TABLE, UL, children: TR,LI), so if this can be done more flexible, you'd have a generic widget.

I have finally had some time to work on the filter widget. I took the version in the ""next"" branch and made a few admendments.

Demo here: [filter widget](http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/filter/demo.html)

Comments:
- I did not change much except for the `children()` selector
- I have replaced the wrapping `<form>` because I'm often stuck wanting to use a filter inside a larger form and the form is never submitted anyway. So now it's a plain textinput wrapped in a `<div>`
- the filter can be used on `listview`, `select`, `table`, `controlgroup` or any element containing children to filter using the `data-itemSelector` attribute (must be a class)
- this also allows to use one filter for multiple datasets and filter anything containing text or filtertext
- I also added `data-target` (must be a class) to place the filter somewhere on the page vs the default behavior

Some Questions:
1. I also adapted the Qunit tests from the [listview](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/next/tests/integration/listview/listview_core.js) widget. Should I add tests for select, table, controlgroup, random as well? 
2. I'm having trouble with one test [""`Custom filterCallback should cause iteration on all list elements`""](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/next/tests/integration/listview/listview_core.js#L657), where my `_refreshCornersCount` is stuck at 2, so the test never fires although it would pass. Who can I ask for help?
3. I still need to update the CSS (not much to do I think). I see 2 icons on the right side of search elements quite often now (delete + search). Give it a try?

See you on IRC

This is because we set `position: static;` instead of `relative` for the header on pages with panels. That rule was added to fix an issue on iOS4.

Solution is to set `position: relative;` for the second header: http://jsbin.com/uzobev/2/edit. I tested that page on iOS4 on Browserstack and didn't see a problem.

Are you sure the buttons didn't appear in the first header on those other browsers? That would be really strange. I tested your JS Bin on Chrome and the buttons were placed in the first header as I would expect.

Closing as resolved.

",jaspermdegroot,kadaj
5625,2013-08-25 00:10:33,"I've got the same problem @kadaj described on Firefox OS device. When using non-native select menu with multiple enabled and more than a couple of items, clicking is _very_ slow.

The reason is that each time an item is clicked, `self.select.trigger( ""change"" );` is fired, which in turn triggers `self.refresh()`. The only reason that is triggered (at least I couldn't find any other) is to call `self.setButtonText()` and `self.setButtonCount()` so that the button shows up to date values. But refresh also does `self._buildList()` which takes a lot of time.

I have made a simple workaround to this problem - changed the code so that `change` is not triggered when `self.menuType === ""page""` (if it's page, we can be sure that we have some more elements on the list so we will encounter this problem and since we don't see the button, I don't see the reason to update it). Instead, I'm calling `self.setButtonText()` and `self.setButtonCount()` in close when `self.menuType === ""page""`.

In addition to that, I think that even when `self.menuType === ""overlay""`, it's not necessary to trigger `change` (and do `self._buildList()`. Calling only `self.setButtonText()` and `self.setButtonCount()` seems to be enough for me. Unless I'm missing something?

Now I don't see any lag when selecting an item and everything seems to still be working OK. Please note that today is my first day of using jquery mobile and I only spend about an hour on figuring out this problem so I may be wrong. I only checked this on 1.3.2 so far but I will take a look at HEAD tomorrow. I may create a PR to if anybody is interested in my changes.

Thanks for looking into this. We are going to review the selectmenu widget for 1.5. It would be good to only rebuild the list if needed. For the table widget we do something similar now, we split the refresh method in a refresh and rebuild method. We won't review PR's for this widget until we are done with the refactor, so it's probably better to wait with a PR. If you still see ways to improve the performance of this widget after we are done, we will be happy to receive a PR from you!

I can confirm the issue if rangeslider is the only selected component. With all components selected rangeslider the problem was gone.

@gseguin 

Because in the custom build the textinput comes after the (range)slider CSS the inputs are broken if the rangeslider is wrapped in a field container. Can we make sure the CSS in the custom build is in the same order as the normal build or do we have to increase the level of specificity of selectors to avoid this issue?

This behaviour is by design. See ""Panel positioning"" in the docs: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/panels/index.html
You can use `data-position-fixed=""true""` for the panel to prevent it. Note that if the panel content doesn't fit in the viewport the framework will disable the fixed positioning and fall back to the default behaviour as you see it on your test page.

Thanks for submitting the issue.

If we remove the `-webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0);` there will be blinks when opening the panel on many platforms/browsers. One thing I remember specifically is that Chrome for Android repainted the right half of the content wrapper during the transition if we didn't set it for `.ui-panel-content-wrap`.

The 3D-ing is quite heavy, performance-wise. In combination with the script you use to append an iframe with the video, set height/width, add/removeClass, etc. it's a bit much and that why it looks choppy.

Maybe we have to document this a bit more.

When panels with display mode reveal or push are used we apply the panel theme to the page. On many platforms/browsers the browser is still painting the panel background when the transition to open it already started. By giving the page underneath the panel the same background we mask this. We also set the theme that is used for the page on the content wrapper. 

If you set your background image like this...



...and set `data-theme=""c""` for the page, the background-image should appear as background of the content wrapper. If you use `data-theme=""a""` for the panel, the page will get that theme too when opening a panel, but you won't see this because the content wrapper is on top of it.

At first we did use `overflow: hidden;` but we had to remove that because buttons didn't work anymore on Android if the toolbar has position fixed. See #4663.

I agree the ""three bars"" button is very common these days. That's why we added it to the icon sprite.
Regarding the styling of the button. As a framework we don't copy styles of specific apps or platforms but try to offer the flexibility to style the button as you want. Including all kind of preset styles would add a lot of Kb's.

You can adjust the border radii of buttons in your theme CSS. Or if you only want to apply it to one specific menu button, add a class with the border-radius you like. This week we added two classes to the theme CSS to make it easier to hide the disc and the use the alt icon color.

That's how JS Bin works. See ""JS Bin instructions"" in our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#test-page).

The ""issue"" with your page is that the panel has no background because you didn't set a theme or custom background for it.

See: http://jsbin.com/izohig/17 (http://jsbin.com/izohig/17/edit). I added a second example there, a ""reveal"" panel.

5561,2013-02-01 14:44:48,"@CarpeTempus

Note that it is highly recommended to always specify height and width for images. This way the browser knows how much space is needed for an image when it starts rendering the page, and not after the images have been loaded.

When you use a fixed header or footer in jQuery Mobile the framework sets padding on the page, equal to the height of the toolbar. If you don't set a size for images in toolbars this might result in setting wrong padding, especially on slower devices.

I have pasted a JSBin url in my previous post. Here's what you can do to repro the issue after which you probably will have a clear understanding of the problem.

1) Fire the URL in iPad with Mobile Safari environment.

2) Open the Custom SelectMenu.

3) Click on any of the option in Custom SelectMenu. If you have fiddler attached to the session, you would not notice any HTTP request from the browser.

4) Now, please try the above steps by replacing iPad with Windows Surface and Use IE10 as browser. In this case, you would _notice_ a HTTP request from the browser which hits the same URL as mentioned in the browser address bar. 

I do not think there should be any extra HTTP request on touch of any link in IE10 with Surface environment which is what happening right now.

In general setting `style=""display:none;""` on a form element doesn't work with jQuery Mobile because we enhance the elements. Text inputs used to be an exception, but not anymore because we added the option to have a clear button.

If the layout on the picture is exactly what you want, you can do this by setting `float: right;` for the last div on the first row.
In case you don't have to stick to a left to right order you could use CSS `column-count` instead. 

Examples: http://jsbin.com/izohig/8 (http://jsbin.com/izohig/8/edit)

If you do need a left to right order, but have to deal with different heights at different positions there is no way to do this with CSS. There are jQuery plugins for this.

I think there are a few things we can improve here. For example, collapsible (sets) nested in another collapsible could get a negative margin to negate the padding on the collapsible content div. Also, I think that a collapsible heading and a list item should both have same padding so they have the same height.

I made a cleaner version of your example: http://jsbin.com/izohig/7 (http://jsbin.com/izohig/7/edit). Would be good to have an example like this in our new Docs & Demos

However, since we wan't to replace the current way we handle nested lists anyway, I think a collapsible is a good alternative. That would mean you don't have to combine listviews and collapsible, but the framework would treat a list item that has a nested list as a collapsible. This is just my opinion though. Have to see what we are going to do with this.
",jaspermdegroot,jukooz
5539,2013-02-15 20:16:35,"@jukooz 

We just use #5415 as a ticket for a new way of handling nested lists. That doesn't mean we are going to implement it like that.
I agree with keeping this simple. Just make a list item collapsible if it contains a nested UL. Same as my example, but better semantic markup and no need for custom CSS.
The example as shown at #5415 could be added to the new demos.
",jaspermdegroot,jukooz
5539,2013-02-16 13:12:50,"@jukooz 

Actually this is my mistake. Somehow I had in mind that #5415 was about displaying nested lists in the list itself, but it's more about fetching any content in a list. That is confusing. Sorry, I should have read better.

5535,2013-01-26 19:31:37,"@ivan-yu

Although I couldn't reproduce it with your test page I do see a possible issue with dynamically adding content to a panel.

I just committed a fix for this. I bound the panel to the ""updatelayout"" event and made it call the `positionPanel` function when this event is fired. The `positionPanel` function will check the height of the panel contents.
See more about the ""updatelayout"" event here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html

So whenever you dynamically add content to a panel that affects its lenght you should trigger this event on the panel. I added it to the `errorPlacement` function on your test page: http://jsbin.com/onibuc/57/edit

We will also add this information to the API documentation.
",jaspermdegroot,ivan-yu
5535,2013-01-27 09:14:26,"@ivan-yu

I am glad it resolved your problem.

Note: On your test page I added the trigger `updatelayout` code to the `errorPlacement` function, just as a quick example. That function is called after each input that didn't pass validation. It would be better for performance if you trigger the event only once, after all inputs have been validated.

Its not an answer I like but its just how it is :( Thankfully at least starting in chrome 35 which is stable now its a simple fix for most cases with the touch-action css prop. Also once the jQuery pointer events polyfill https://github.com/jquery/jquery-pointer-events is ready we will be switching to using that in place of our vmouse abstraction. This will allow us to implement this in a consistent cross platform way. There is a test implementation of this in the polymer branch https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/polymer this currently however does not support ie8 or 9 as this uses the polymer pointer events polyfill directly rather then the jQuery version.

5534,2015-05-30 20:20:23,"Still seeing this problem with an up-to-date S5 (AT&T) running Android native browser and Android 4.4.2. Not surprisingly angular ng-swipe-left and ng-swipe-right are also effected. 

I did notice a discrepancy in the user-agent strings between Chrome and Native Browser on this device:
**Chrome:** ...(HTML, Like Gecko) **Chrome/43.0.2357.78**...
**Native Browser:** ...(HTML, Like Gecko) **Version 1.6 Chrome/28.0.1500.94**...

So apparently an up-to-date S5 is running Chrome 28 as the rendering engine in it's default browser? Note that [remote debugging in the native browser seems to have died when Android switched from Apple's rendering engine to Chrome](http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/75336/why-is-the-android-stock-browser-still-alive).

Unfortunately S5 is the most popular Android out there and most people still use the big Internet button by default. So even though this is Google/Samsung's problem, it's our problem. 

Can anyone give me a straightforward monkey patch to get some kind of swipe to work on the old Chrome rendering engine? 

Edit: I see the ez-shim above by @TNT-RoX . I am going to try that.*

Edit edit: no dice. I can only get the ""swipeLeft"" and ""swipeRight"" events to fire (using test.html) on desktop chrome - but not on either the Native Browser or Chrome on the device referenced above. Seems like el.onscroll doesn't fire at all on those browsers on the test app.

If we would make this optional and it is set to `false`, a lot of the unstyled `body` will be visible below the page if there is not much content on the page. Besides this, I think there might be issues with page transitions.

The `resetActivePageHeight` function already takes border and padding into account (while those default to 0). Don't you think it would be a better approach if we would do the same for margin?

Although I don't see it on your test page, I can confirm the issue. I think it depends on OS/resolution/etc. if you see the issue or not.
We do set the border in the CSS, but this is a Chrome bug. It seems to be a rounding problem and happens when `em` values are used for top/bottom padding, like we do.
The bug has been reported to Chrome: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=153584
If Chrome doesn't fix this we have to consider switching to `px` or `ex` values for top/bottom padding.

Can you please be more specific as to what is happening? Can you write down the steps you're performing? What cross button?

I, for one, cannot reproduce what you're seeing using the ""Sign In"" example from the demos. Of course, since there is no ""cross button"", I'm dismissing the popup by clicking on its overlay. So, these are my steps:
1. Open http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/popup/
2. Scroll down to ""Form""
3. Click ""Sign In""
4. Focus on ""username""
5. Click outside the popup to close it.
6. Click ""Sign In"" to re-invoke the popup.

These steps do not cause the behaviour you're seeing.

I've tried under both IE7 emulation in IE9 (eg 'IE7 mode') along with IE7 vanilla.

5512,2013-02-18 12:52:58,"@erikyuzwa AFAICT IE7 is also broken on 1.2.0: http://jsbin.com/esazem/1 ... as you go through the sequence

page1(start) -> page2 -> page3 -> page1 -> page2

and then hit ""Back"" repeatedly, you find that you have to click the ""Back"" button many times before it will retreat to the previous page:

The first step (page1 <- page2) back is immediate - that's correct.
The second step (page3 <- page1) takes two clicks of the ""Back"" button.
The third step (page2 <- page3) also takes two clicks of the ""Back"" button.
The fourth step (page1 <- page2) takes three clicks of the ""Back"" button.

At this point, although you're seeing the start page, there's still a history entry to go before you get to the beginning. So, there's no reliable way of operating the ""Back"" button. That's why we've chosen to document instead that, if you wish to support IE7, you're better of with single-page, AJAX-linked documents instead of a single, multipage document.

In addition to @gabrielschulhof his comment...

In previous versions the JS applied those corner classes. For performance we changed this to having the JS only apply the `ui-corner-all` or `ui-btn-corner-all` class. In the CSS we added rules to make child elements inherit the `border-radius` for the applicable corners.

If you used those classes for other elements you have to add them to your custom CSS. Note that you don't need the `-moz` prefixed property anymore. Two examples with the default radius of .6em:

The issue you reported was caused by the way we force hardware acceleration on WebKit browsers: we set `-webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0);` for the divs that are animated. The fix was setting the same rule for all divs in the content.

However, we noticed that this causes problems with at least one widget (rangeslider) so I removed the fix. It only appears to be a problem when `column-count` is used to layout a form. Since there is no way to narrow the scope so the fix would only apply in this situation, we can't fix this in the framework. I added information about the issue and how to fix it to the panel documentation. 

This means you have to add the fix in your custom CSS. I added it on your test page: http://jsbin.com/uhefac/25/edit

While looking into this again I noticed some other issues with `column-count` in general. Maybe you already found out, but if not...

`column-count` and `box-shadow` don't seem to play nice together. In the first collapsible, on Chrome, when the first input in the right column gets focus you see the top of the focus style at the bottom of the left column. On Firefox it was even worse, the whole input moves to the first column when it has the focus style. The fix for this is to set a bit top and bottom margin on the form elements.

Also the first collapsible, Chrome renders the top half of the input in the left column and the bottom half in the right column on certain screen widths. To prevent this you can set `-webkit-column-break-inside: avoid;` for the field containers.

I suppose with ""stability issues"" you mean the popup you try to chain is not opened?

As you know chaining popups is not supported, so the only way we can ""fix"" this issue is changing the workaround we show in the docs.

Does increasing the timeout fix it? Can you rule out that it is `got_data` that returns `false` because something isn't loaded yet?

Also, what iPhone / iOS version are you testing on?
",jaspermdegroot,psimondk
5496,2013-01-20 14:32:35,"Hi,

We tested on 4GS / IOS 6.0.1 and the issue was that popup's chained or not
were not opened after the background was 'darkened' regardless of whether
the popup's were simple links in the HTML page or programatically opened
through JS. The same code and use/test cases performs ok with 1.2.0.

The 'got_data' is a var declared within the 'pageinit' function that is set
by another user action, so probably the timeout value shouldn't affect it,
but we'll give it a try.

If you for instance enter 'cop' in the searchfield you will experience that

comment out 1.2.0 and comment in 'latest' it works as expected.

The ajax code has been changed into the one, that the JQM team provides to

As from 1.3 the text input is wrapped in a div when it gets enhanced. This is because we added the clear button. The box-shadow is applied to this wrapper div and the clear button is a child of this div - so it's a sibling of the input element.

With most of the form elements setting a style on the original element won't work. If we would change this, and apply the style to the wrapper that we create, we would take away the possibility to set a fallback style for C-grade/non-JS browsers.

One thing we are going to change is adding the classes of the original element (with a suffix) to the wrapper, so it's easier to target them with custom CSS. See #3577.

IMHO it is a javascript problem. Maybe a dev @uGoMobi or @toddparker could give us pointer to where to look at?

We set a default padding for `.ui-page-header-fixed`, but it looks like on `pagebeforeshow` this class has not been added yet.

Thanks for reporting the issue.
The panel widget wraps the non-fixed toolbars and content in a div and applies the theme used for the page to this div. When you open a panel the theme of the panel is applied to the page. This is because on many mobile platforms you would see a blink because the panel background isn't rendered yet.
Fixed toolbars aren't wrapped so this means that if you set a top offset for a fixed header you will see the same background as used for the panel above the fixed header.
However, there were issues with the page height when a panel is open. This has just been fixed.

Should the false result of an getAttribute method result in an undefined?
  -> Yes,  If jqmData() can't find matched attribute or a data in an array, jqmData() returns undefined. The committed codes with undefined can meet the jqmData()'s return value.

What is jqmData doing in those cases when the attribute is not found?
  ->  As you may know, jqmData() calls jQuery.fn.extend.data() hence, if jQuery.fn.extend.data() doesn't find the attribute, it returns undefined. You can understand it with the jQuery codes and my comments below.

return data === undefined && parts[1] ?      // If jQuery.data() doesn't find the attribute, the data is undefined.
this.data( parts[0] ) :
data;                                                        // It returns undefined.

I'm guessing I introduced this bug when I re-implemented `$.mobile.hashListeningEnabled`. Part of the problem is that it's not clear what that setting accomplished before the refactor. 

That is, we didn't have any tests for it :(

@gabrielschulhof 

When `$.mobile.hashListeningEnabled` is `false` how are dialogs supposed to work? Recall that previously our entire navigation infrastructure was based on hash events so for the most part this means that navigation is ""OFF"". At the very least that was the assumption I made when re-implementing it. 

More importantly when I made the addition I did my testing with the assumption that `$.mobile.linkBindingEnabled` was also `false` (stupid). So it might be that we only need to figure out what it means to have link binding enabled but to have hash listening disabled. This is really just a different way of wording your last comment, ie ""we should have a way of adding to urlHistory even without modifying the hash for cases like this"".

I don't know very much about the internal working of jQuery Mobile, but in my experience it turned out to be possible to disable changes of the URL/hash by just commenting out the line `window.location.hash = hash;` in `$.mobile.Navigator.prototype.go()` (see code example from four days ago). Wouldn't that be an easy solution (or is it too easy)?
",jhogervorst,johnbender
5465,2013-01-21 18:20:33,"@jhogervorst 

It depends. Calling `$.mobile.navigate` comes with some expectations, including history entry creation that matches the browsers history. Breaking that assumption might hurt other parts of the library.

Also we want to keep those settings confined to the old nav code where we can. They're already bleeding into the navigate event. The goal is to have these stand on their own as functionality for users who don't want to use the whole of JQM.
",johnbender,jhogervorst
5465,2013-01-21 20:24:27,"@johnbender



These two settings in concert pretty much turn off browser history handling. [Dialog](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/a9a6b234c45f0e100d613fed3e55eecb58f8ed60/js/widgets/dialog.js#L123) and [popup](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/a9a6b234c45f0e100d613fed3e55eecb58f8ed60/js/widgets/popup.js#L190) both have provisions for dealing with the situation where modifications of the hash are undesirable. Navigation is then based solely on $.mobile.urlHistory and $.mobile.changePage, which itself had code for avoiding the call to $.mobile.path.set(), which would then set the hash. However, with $.mobile.navigate() the setting of the hash has been tied to the creation of urlHistory entries, which makes the above logic impossible.

I just realized... We will probably make a swipe event anywhere on the page close an open panel as long as direction corresponds with the position of the panel. So this would also include a menu button in the header.

I thought it was caused by a scrollbar that showed up when opening a panel (this is fixed now), but it is a general icon misalignment issue that I have noticed on Chrome before. However, I can't reproduce it anymore.
I am afraid this is a Chrome bug that we can't fix. I did a quick search in Chrome bug reports, but couldn't find anything. Might be useful to report it if the issue can also be reproduced on a simple non-JQM test page.

There is a problem with our icon sprite. The issue has not been fixed yet by @arschmitz his commit. When we've replaced the icon sprite the issue will most probably be gone.
However, I am not completely sure if there isn't some other issue in play here, because it is strange that the problem is gone when you hover the icon or test without border-radius.

The problem is the combination of `dir=""rtl""`, having the page wrapped in another element (in your case a `form`), and using a widget where we use `position: absolute; top: -99999px; left: -9999px;` to hide an element. We use this for the popup widget, but also in some form widgets to hide the native form element.

Two ways to resolve your issue with custom CSS. Set `left: auto; right: -9999px;` for the element we hide or, much easier... `body { overflow-x: hidden; }`.

code: http://jsbin.com/ehowik/13/edit (also `margin: 0;` to override browsers' default margin for the `body`)
preview: http://jsbin.com/ehowik/13 (text is underneath the ""edit in JS Bin label"")

5440,2013-01-22 10:23:43,"@asafxrev 

The CSS in your comment is same as the first solution I mentioned, but you would have to negate the `left` offset too by setting it to `auto`. Since we use this approach 12 times in the CCS (not only for popup) it doesn't seem very effective to me to override this for ""rtl"", while just setting `overflow-x: hidden` for the `body` resolves it too.

Currently we set `body.ui-mobile-viewport { overflow-x: hidden; }`. The viewport class is added to the parent element of the page. Because you wrap them in a `form` element, the class is not added to the `body`. Maybe we could change this and always disable horizontal overflow for the `body` (remove the viewport class from the selector). We would have to see if this has downsides for situations other than yours.

We do want JQM to work well with ""rtl"". See #5167. However, your issue is not just caused by using ""rtl"", but using it in combination with a `form` as wrapper. In general, there might always be edge cases where you have to fix something with custom CSS. I agree that we have to document it if we know about such case. Since this is not only an issue with popups it might be best if we have a central section about ""rtl"".

I think it's best for now to not make changes in the framework CSS or documentation, but wait the outcome of #5167. I will add a comment there about your issue.

Note: If we decide to make changes in the framework CSS to fix this issue we have to look at the following issues and commit messages.

All labels are aligned with the top of the form element. I think this is a matter of personal preference.

If we would want to change this we run into the following issues:
- We don't know if the label is next to a mini sized element or not
- Labels have font-size 16px while text inputs have font-size 14px and mini sized form buttons 12.5px
- Vertical alignment of text in form elements can be different across browsers

I think we should leave it up to the developer to align the label differently with custom CSS and close this ticket as won't fix.

There once was a fetchlink functionality planned for JQM 1.past ([here's a demo](http://view.jquerymobile.com/fetchlink/docs/pages/fetchlinks/pix-4.html)). I'm doing a lot of content-pulling and was thinking whether this should not be combined into the container widget. 

Something like:
- a page can have any number of `<div data-role=""container""></div>` widgets. 
- like the `<body>` tag, all containers are viewports.
- when doing a changePage, user can specify changePage option `container=""container_id""` to override default `<body>` (normal changePage). 
- calling `navigate` vs changePage does sound better.
- the loaded content will be appended to the container (... `ui-container-page`?)
- changeHash option specifies whether this transition is tracked in `urlHistory`  

JQM navigation more or less does this on a page level already (pulling a page, extracting content, appending, tracking in history), so containers would just be sort of a sub-navigation. This should allow pages to persist with only content changing, keep trackable history, plus transitions should work nicely, too.

I will try to see if I can hack an example together.

Thoughts?

A lot of what you outlined is what I have in mind for the content container.
- This is the first pass at breaking up navigation but the ultimate purpose for having a content container is to allow multiple content containers on the same page for tablet UI applications
- The default state is for jquery mobile applications to have a single container that defaults to the body. This is important because it informs how we'll replace `changePage` and `loadPage` as global methods.
- This is where we differ, when this is finished the global `changePage` and `loadPage` will be deprecated, and will look something like:


-  This is the ideal. Calling `$.mobile.navigate( 'some_url', opts)` and letting the navigate binding of the content container widget ""work it out"". When we get to the point that the UI requires multiple containers we'll need to think through providing hooks for managing the individual urls and loading specific content based on them. We've had some very basic discussion around this but it's not clear how we can encode enough information in a url to designate the right content for multiple containers. One approach is to have a single ""primary container"" that retrieves the content at a url and uses that content to delegate content to other containers on the page. This is the point at which hooks would be provided to allow the client to determine how that content is delegated.

One more note on link bindings.

I've talked with @gabrielschulhof about this but we can pretty easily setup `$.mobile.navigate` to pass arguments through when it triggers the navigate event so we can remove the `$.mobile.changePage` calls from our link bindings and make them an optional module.

Obviously that has implications for the ""fetch links"" in that they would just be links with a simple binding to trigger a navigate with some special options possibly.

Thanks for the PR! It's a very nice performance improvement.

I pulled your changes in a branch called ""pr-5404"". There was a small issue in vmouse.js but that is fixed in the branch.
I discussed your PR with @arschmitz and we are in favor of using `$.mobile.window` and `$.mobile.document` (without the $ sign) as variable names.

Going to run all tests on that branch now.

Yes, ""jquerymobile.com/test"" uses latest code. Every time we commit a change/fix to branch ""master"" the result will be visible on ""/test"" within a few minutes.

To be honest I don't see the need of adding an option ""disable"" for collapsible. It adds quite some code to the framework while this is currently already possible by simply adding class `ui-disabled` to your collapsible heading. That also prevents the collapsible to expand on click. Example: http://jsbin.com/osiwuw/18

Your test page is incomplete, it only contains page 1. However, I think I already see the problem. When you navigate to page 2, both the first and second page are in the DOM and based on your script I think you use the same ID for the buttons. You have to make sure you use unique ID's or use a class.

Also, you bind to ""pageshow"". This results in attaching handlers again when a page is shown a second time (if it was not removed from the DOM). In general it's better to bind to the ""pageinit"" event.

The one with clicking on the track, as soon as you drag instead of click (press) it will drag the other handle. Need to be careful with that one.

Found one issue (I think a base slider bug); the highlight from the slider is below other elements and is cut off (confirmed on desktop FF & Chrome and iPad):

`orientationChangeEnabled` still works as expected, but I think you misunderstood what this is about. By setting this to `false` you turn off the binding to the native orientationchange event. See the section ""Orientation change event"" on this page http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html

As far as I know there is know way to tell a browser to always render a page as landscape, even when the device is in portait mode, if that's what you mean. It's probably possible when you develop an app.

on your site because your front page is black and your other pages are white this results in the flash you are seeing when transitioning to the white page. going back this is not as noticeable because you are going from a white page to a black one.

The iOS zoom fix is somewhat brittle and can sometimes still zoom in, even in master, but I'm not sure we can improve  it much further. There is already a lot of trickery to make this work as well as it does now. I just wish iOS would let us prevent this behavior, especially when the page fits fine and no zooming is really needed.

We set background none for dialogs because we want to show the overlay (page container). That's why you see other content that is not wrapped in a page.
When we switch from dialog as a widget to an option in the page widget we could consider setting the overlay theme on the page if it is a dialog. However, I think it's the dev's responsibility to handle content (other than widgets like panels and popups) outside pages when using pages.

Unless JavaScript in general has been disabled in or is not supported by the browser the JQM JS will be loaded, because nothing tells the browser not to load the script that is included in the head.
Part of the JQM JS are the support tests. Based on the results of some of those tests we define A, B or C-grade. The first thing we do on init is checking if it is C-grade and if so we don't continue with enhancing the page. This is what we mean by ""no JS"".

It looks like your Series 40 device fails to run the support tests. This is most probably because it has a proxy browser, which means the JS is not executed on the device but on a proxy server.
See: http://www.developer.nokia.com/Resources/Library/Web/#!nokia-browsers/nokia-browser-for-series-40.html

You reported a white page so I think the problem is that class `ui-mobile-rendering` is not removed. That class sets everything to `visibility: hidden;` and is removed when we are done initializing the page. There is a fallback that removes the class anyway after 5 secs, but it looks like this is not working. Strange thing is that we already did it that way in 1.1.0 and you don't have the problem in that version. I am looking into it.

I just committed a fix for this. Downside of the fix is that the inputs became far too heigh on IE7/8. To resolve this, and some other issues, I made some bigger changes to the textinput widget.

Bigger changes like that is not something we can land in a maintenance release like the upcoming 1.2.1. So we decided to wait with the fix for the issue that you reported until 1.3 as well.

For now you can add this to your custom CSS to fix the issue:



And if you use a class to target old IE (e.g. `<!--[if lt IE 9]> <html class=""old-ie""> <![endif]-->`) you can negate the min-height to fix the height of inputs on IE7/8:

There's a fundamental issue with delaying the page initialization and supporting popstate. The popstate that's fired when returning from an external URL contains information about how the page should be initialized, so delaying the initialization means we need to store that info until it happens.

Thanks for the PR! I reviewed your code and created a [test page](http://jquerymobile.com/branches/text-input-clear-btn/docs/demos/textinput/index.html). Here is my feedback:
- `clearBtn: false` should be added to `options` so you can configure the default or set the option programmatically, not only with the data- attribute.
- With your code the clear button is added if you don't set the data- attribute at all. After making `clearBtn` an option you can use `if ( input.is( ""[type='text']"" ) && !!o.clearBtn ) { }`. The widget factory will check if `data-clear-btn` has been set.
- I think we should introduce option `clearButtonText` and deprecate `clearSearchButtonText`.
- Except for the variable `focusedEl` the code for adding the clear button is exactly the same as for ""search"" so we shouldn't have to duplicate everything.
- Text inputs and textarea should get the `ui-corner-all` class instead of `ui-btn-corner-all`.
- The disabled styling doesn't work anymore.
- The width is incorrect when wrapped in a div with `data-role=""fieldcontain""`.
- There are some conflicts with native browser controls for input types number, date, etc. (I tested on Chrome). I am not sure yet what we should do with those.
- The slider widget has a number input that is enhanced by the textinput widget. In this case `clearBtn` should always be ``false`.

I know it is quite a lot. Do you want to look into this?

Thanks a lot! I pulled your changes in the branch that I created, so the test page is updated... looks good!

Had to make a small change because of an undeclared variable. Also, at second thought `clearBtnText` is a more consistent name for the option, so I changed that. See my commits here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/text-input-clear-btn

I will take a closer look at the JS and CSS soon and will let you know what we want to do with the number and date input.

I just merged your commits in master.

I made a few changes. We think the clear button shouldn't be optional for ""search"". I enabled the option for all input types. We still have to look into date, number, color and other HTML5 input types, but those can be added to the blacklist. We also decided not to add the feature for textareas because this is not really common, and you are not happy when you accidently touch the clear button after typing long message on your phone ;-)

When I wrote that I was thinking about using the same one or two breakpoints for all widgets and you mentioned 30em (480px) for tables as one of them. As discussed we are not going to use generic breakpoints, so make sense to use 28em here.

I agree that making changes to this feature, just for the sake of consistency is not a good idea. That was not the main reason for suggesting an opt-in class for fieldcontain as well. It's more like, if we introduce this for other widgets it's a good opportunity to do the same here, because it's not easy to negate the fieldcontain CSS if you want to use a different breakpoint.

However, I see your point that adding `data-role=""fieldcontain""` is pretty much the same as adding an opt-in class. Difference is that I added a function to the fieldcontain JS that prevents wrapping of full width forms, so it's not only CSS.

Let's see if we can come up with a solution that doesn't break things when used with current markup.

@mrextreme - Here is a simple workaround: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/486

I used `.ui-selectmenu` to select the popup selectmenu. We should look into adding the `id` of the select element with a prefix/suffix so you can target a specific selectmenu. See also [my comment](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5254#issuecomment-10226360) here #5254.

There is an option `filterCallback`.
In 1.2 we added the `listviewbeforefilter` event, but it looks like this hasn't been documented yet. See #4721.
In 1.3 we will add the option `filterReveal` which makes it possible to initially hide all list items. This is already in latest code on branch master.

@gabrielschulhof - Can we add the `id` of the `select` with a suffix/prefix to the popup? Similar to what we do for the popup container. This way we keep unique `id`'s, but people would have a selector to target a specific selectmenu popup.

@kevinbhayes - You had the script in the body and no div[data-role=""page""]. This results in two select buttons. See the last paragraph of this page: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-anatomy.html. In general we recommend to put scripts in the head.

This will work: http://jsbin.com/enetay/50/edit
Note that `live()` is deprecated in jQuery 1.7+ (we kept it in the docs because we supported 1.6.4).

I suggest not to bind a click handler to a page transitions event like `pagebeforeshow` but to a page initialization event like `pageinit` to prevent binding again the second time a page is shown (if it wasn't removed from the DOM). And also to avoid problems with the first page (not all transition events fire and there could be a timing issue).

Without a test page it's not clear where you put that script and if you bind it to an event. Anyway, this is not a bug, but a problem with your code.

Although this is more a question for the forum... if bind your script to the `pagebeforecreate` event it should work. See ""Page initialization events"" on this page in the docs: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
Best is to put script in the `<head>`.

Alternatively you could leave out `data-role=""listview""` and just call the listview plugin after you added the listitems:



If you need to update your list after it was already enhanced you can use the refresh method.

Using persistent headers (same data-id) doesn't mean the header is moved from one page to another. It just means the header stays in view during transition. So it's correct that there are two headers in the DOM after you navigate to page 2.

You can use unique ID's for each of your pages, header or ""save buttons"" to use them in a selector: http://jsbin.com/enetay/29/edit

Note about your code: Initialization of a page and setting it to the active page isn't done in sync. When a page is initialized it isn't in view yet, so it isn't the active page yet either. When the `pageinit` event fires for your page 2 the `$.mobile.activePage` in your selector is narrowing the scope to page 1 because at that moment this is still the active page.

Closing because this is not a bug.

The issue happens because `data-rel=""back""` is missing in the link of the large cancel button in @jerone his fiddle. See ""Closing dialogs"" here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dialog/index.html

The back button on pageTwo is dynamically created. When you don't use `data-rel=""back""` on the link that brings you back from dialogThree (which is also a page) to pageTwo it adds an item to the history stack. That's why the back button on pageTwo then requires two clicks to actually bring you back to pageOne.
The active state is removed from a (back) button on the `pagehide` event. On the first click you stay on the same page, so this event doesn't fire and the button keeps the active state.

I added `data-rel=""back""` and then everything works as expected: http://jsfiddle.net/jEesE/6/

Thus, in the current implementation, the slider overrides the form widget's implementation of _reset(), calling refresh() with some parameters.

I have to agree, on some browsers the slider is less responsive.
People keep trying again when the slider reacts slow, with frustrating results.

Tested it on Samsung Galaxy S3 (default browser -> _slow_, Firefox -> _medium_, Chrome -> _fast_, Opera -> _medium_), Samsung Galaxy Mini (default browser -> _slow_), Experia Arc S (default browser -> _slow_), iPhone 4 & 5 (Safari -> _medium_) and iPad 2 (Safari -> _fast_).

In my opinion, in the `refresh` method some calculations could be removed outside or done only at the beginning when the user presses the handle.

Test case: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/listviews/listview-filter-autocomplete.html

Steps to reproduce: Enter first 3 characters of a city name. Click on the clear button or view source button.
Because the ""change"" event is fired after you blur the input, the first click on one of those buttons triggers that event. Only after you click a second time the input field will be cleared or source view popup will be opened.
However, if we wouldn't bind to ""change"" the list wouldn't be updated when you click on the clear button.

[Now](a743616) we also bind to the ""input"" event to fix problems with multibyte characters (e.g. Japanese), the problem became a bit worse.  When you enter a character both ""keyup"" and ""input"" fire and in the test case this means two Ajax calls. I don't think the ""input"" event is supported by all browsers that we support, so we can't just drop ""keyup"".

Regarding pasting text which @arschmitz mentioned: Maybe we can resolve this by binding to ""paste"" and ""cut"" events, but again browser support might be a problem. And we would still need ""change"" to update the list when the clear button is clicked, unless we make this trigger a ""clear"" event or something.

I have had a look and certainly see the problem.  However even when taking out your custom CSS it is still present.  There must be something different / wrong with what's happening there.  I haven't figured it out quite yet but as you can see in the [docs](http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html) for the popup, if you look at the form example there no ghosting/artifacts occur on Chrome.  There must be some kind of conflict in the code.  Could you perhaps show us the raw html before it gets marked up by the framework as it seems you've done a copy of your DOM when it's already been marked up.  I think if we strip away (comment out) all the other elements on the page we'll eventually get it working correctly even with your custom theme.

This is normal behaviour.  As the loading of subsequent pages takes place via AJAX there will be the original page and the loaded page in the DOM.  I can suggest that you either use a unique ID for the pages or you specify `data-ajax=""false""` on the link to the 2nd page as outlined [here](http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/pages/page-scripting.html) in the Docs.  If this isn't an option you can get the active page's header with a similar command to this
`$( '[data-role=header]', $.mobile.activePage ).size()` which will only return 1 in your example.

5167,2015-09-24 22:37:16,"@arschmitz the usage of `*-beginning / end` is awesome, and actually working on a proper RTL implementation is awesome, too.  The other part of class naming for icons is for when the icon itself has an indication of directionality, but is has `*-l / r` in the name. For example, the icon arrow-r is often used to indicate a forward facing arrow (as far as LTR is concerned) for more options in a listview.  Aliasing these icons to arrow-next, arrow-previous, carat-next, carat-previous, etc, to arrow-l, arrow-r, carat-r, carat-l depending on the current context (RTL or LTR) would save applications having to swap these icons around themselves.

It would also be good if a proper RTL implementation also supported LTR within a RTL context for screens where multiple languages and orientations of text are required. I've done my best to try an implement that in my modifications, and have provided demos of that functionality.

Looking forward to reading those talks.

5163,2012-12-03 23:37:43,"@toddparker Thanks! Here are a few observations:
1. I think you'll want a way to prevent horizontal scrolling when the panel is open. Our method was to give the body a class consisting of: position:fixed;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;overflow-x:hidden;.
2. It can be problematic if the height of the panel equals the height of the page, i.e. if a user open the panel using a link in the middle of the page, he/she can't see the navigation in the panel without scrolling to the top.
3. The ""pan"" display mode slides the panel in. My ideal visual effect is for the page to ""reveal"" the panel underneath.  :)

5163,2012-12-28 00:33:38,"@toddparker You're welcome! I didn't set Hardware acceleration to ""true"" for the WebView, so that's probably not it.
The android WebView behaves quite differently from the standard browser or Chrome and to my findings it's the worst of all :/ However I believe PhoneGap uses the Android WebView as well, so good support for it would be welcomed by many. 

Now I haven't had time to test your suggestions yet, but here's the app I made which allows you to input a URL and it'll open the page inside an Android WebView (hardware acceleration not set), that way you can test things easily ;)

That info was in the 1.3 beta release but we removed it afterwards. When we started witing the code for the panel we made it possible to programmatically open two panels. When working on the CSS it became clear that we can't support it, because we use 3D transforms for smooth transitions and don't just set a left/right offset.
You can also imagine it would cause problems on screens less than 34em width (twice the panel width). So we are not planning on supporting it in a future version.

You can call the navbar plugin to enhance the navbar after you appended the list items. Without list items there is nothing to enhance yet, so you can leave out `data-role=""navbar""`. That `data-` attribute is only used to auto initialize the navbar plugin. Example: http://jsbin.com/ikisux/35/edit

However, it should also be possible to enhance the navbar by using `trigger(""create"")`. In that case you do need to set `data-role=""navbar""` and the issue you reported occurs. Test page: http://jsbin.com/ikisux/36/edit
Related issue: #4990

The error only occurs with jQuery core 1.8.x, because of changes in Sizzle. It's not a regression because with one list item there is no issue and that's what #1107 was about. The reason the issue wasn't noticeable before was in fact a bug in Sizzle.

Thanks for reporting the issue.

The cause of it is exactly the same as #4663. On Chrome for Android `overflow: hidden;` in a fixed toolbar makes buttons unresponsive when you scroll the page.

In this case we use `overflow: hidden;` for `.ui-select .ui-btn`. We have to see if we can do without that without causing other issues.

We also have to test if this Chrome bug is causing issues when using `ui-grid` or `ui-bar` in fixed toolbars because those classes have `overflow` set to `hidden` as well.

It looks like the collapse event is triggered intentional on create to mark up the collapsible.

That ""Coment & Close"" button is annoying, I know ;-)

The easiest way is to open the JS Bin on 4 tabs in your browser. Each url will update to a new version as soon as you start editing, but won't change as long as you keep the JS Bin open. Use the full url's for your links.

Now I know that you use a single page model, I think I also know the cause of your problem. The first page that you load always remains in the DOM. Other pages are removed from the DOM after you leave them. That's why you see the initial value of the select if you visit those pages again.
Because there can be more than one page in the DOM at the same time you should also make sure you use unique ID's for the select and listview on all your pages.

Simple solution is to set `data-dom-cache=""true""` to prevent the pages from being removed. Downside is that it will increase the DOM size. Other solution is to store the value of the select as data attached to the body element.

Related pages in the docs:
data-dom-cache=""true"" - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-cache.html
jqmData() - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/methods.html

I am closing this issue, because I don't think this is a bug. To get more help with this you can post on the [forum](https://forum.jquery.com/jquery-mobile).

BTW - I recommend you to update to jQuery Mobile version 1.1.1 or 1.2.

I am glad this solved it for you. Best way to test on Chrome is to open a new incognito window, because in that mode it doesn't cache pages.

After updating your test page to jQuery Mobile 1.2.0 I didn't see the issue with the select menu: http://jsbin.com/owodon/2
You use a custom select menu in which case we hide the native dropdown menu. Is the problem that the custom menu is already visible or that the native dropdown menu isn't hidden?
What version of jQuery core did you use and on what OS / browsers did you see the issue?

In Android ICS some z-index bugs show up when there is an element with `position: fixed;` on the page. We made changes to the popup widget to avoid those issues.

When testing your JS Bin test page I saw the bug. However, when I tested your code, including custom CSS and JS, on my local server the problem was gone. Difference: no ""Edit in JS Bin"" element at the right top with `position: fixed;`.

My device is on Android 4.1.1 so I could only test on the SDK. Do you see the issue on your S3 when testing on your server instead of using JS Bin?
",jaspermdegroot,gstevenson
5116,2012-10-03 13:01:48,"@gstevenson 

A workaround is to set z-index 2 (or anything between 2 and 1098) for your element with fixed positioning and set position fixed for the popup overlay (selector: `#IdOfYourPopup-screen`).
I think there was a particular reason we used position absolute for the overlay and not fixed, but I can't recall at the moment. So you really would have to test this thoroughly.

Other solution is to just set z-index 1100 for your element with fixed positioning. Downside is that the element will be on top of the overlay.

The button that you use in a list item is not part of the listview widget. The refresh method of the listview widget only takes care of enhancement of the listview itself (button styling for the `li`, corner styling of `ul`, etc.).

The enhancement of the added button is done by the button widget. Two things you can do:

Call the button plugin directly to enhance the button: http://jsfiddle.net/mHLnY/2/
Trigger the `create` event on the listview, because the button plugin is bound that event: http://jsfiddle.net/mHLnY/1/

I updated your fiddle to use latest code instead of version 1.0 RC2

Thanks a lot for working on this!

I suggest to move the popup example to its own page like the other ""advanced popup examples"". Right now your example won't work if you navigate from another page to the popup page because of our Ajax nav. We set ```data-ajax=""false"" on the links to the example pages to make sure the script is loaded.

We probably have to do something similar for the dialog example.

You append the popup to `div[data-role=""page""]` but I think this should be the active page.

We do pass along the options object from each call to, `data.options` since we accept an args param as settings in the call. The events that pass the options in as data are:
- pagebeforeload
- pageload
- pageloadfailed
- pagebeforechange
- pagechange
- pagechangefailed

So a call to `changePage` like:



would get `data.options.bar == ""baz""` in each of those events. We just need to include the call options on the transition events it looks like (`pagebeforeshow`, `pagebeforehide`, `pageshow`, and `pagehide`).

You don't need to set a fixed width to solve this. The only problem is this part:



Change `bind` into `on` and it will work.

However, you don't need to set a  max-width at all, because the widget contains CSS for this and a tolerance functionality. Only thing you have to look into is max-height. See http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/popup-images.html

In 1.2 there is a new page loading widget. See http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/loader.html. On that page you can read how to make it work in 1.2.

In a nutshell:
Instead of `$.mobile.showPageLoadingMsg();` use `$.mobile.loading( 'show' );` and change `$.mobile.hidePageLoadingMsg();` into `$.mobile.loading( 'hide' );`.

I pretty much followed the code on Filament example and just replaced elements with JQM widgets. So I'm following the same logic as in your provided link. 

For the datatables version, I partially replaced datatables optional JqueryUI with JqueryMobileUI and then ported the functions from tableview into a post datatable- handle. So first datatables adds all the functionality, then JQM enhances the table. Works nice.

Give me a few hours, I will try to bring the code up to JQM 1.2, add some notes and commit.

5093,2012-09-29 12:40:56,"@toddparker, @Wilto:  

I have updated my demo to the latest JQM (new page: [here](http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/tableview/demo.html) and pushed the commented code to my [tableview repo](https://github.com/frequent/tableview)).

This version is close to the version I'm currently using (with datatables). I have changed the custom select to native selects on my site, but for the new demo I changed native selects to popup, so you the widget now uses popup for the column toggles by default. I also JQM gridded the top and bottom wrappers.

There is a bunch of stuff in tableview which you probably don't need/want (filling the wrapper slots, auto adding a selectable-checkbox-column ...). I have labelled the js/css in the code, so you can just pick what you like. 

The tricky stuff also should more or less work - tricky being responsive columns with `multi-row table headers` (more than two will be too difficult to toggle) and table header cells usually having `non-JQM classes` in which case the original responsive example doesn't work.

What I haven't added yet is a wrapper-div around the table and slot elements. Without this, the plugin will run into trouble if  more than one tableview is in the DOM. I also still need to add the code for the select (vs popup) toggle menu and get the zebra function to work (odd/even theming table rows).

ok. My 2cents: 
- I wouldn't close the popup after every check. I had used custom selects before switching to native selects and I sorely miss configuring the table in one step and not having to select over and over to get the layout I want. 
- prio 1-6 does seem like a lot. Unless you are aming for webTV.
- nice idea with the `abbr`
- curious to see what users say regarding theming options. The way I'm reading it now, you are stressing to keep the table ""bare"", but also provide a ton of classes to manually style the table. I kind of like the JQM way = data-theme=""done"". Adding classes for borders, backgrounds, et all manually does seem a little complicated compared to other widgets, don't you think? 
- and on my Firefox, this table isn't responsive at all :-)

5093,2012-10-22 22:33:28,"I agree with @frequent about auto-closing the popup. I think it'd be nice to keep it open while in use. I'm also curious if we think we need a popup plugin dependency here, as it'll add a bit of weight. 

Agreed on the number of priorities too, though I admittedly don't know what would be appropriate. It seems like a more simple system of having just high and low priority items would be enough for most cases.

As for theming, I'm still unsure about the role of the plugin and whether it makes sense to offer themed table styles at all, or just general show/hide behavior. The row styles feel more like a general table style that one might use in their website without jQM's helps, so I'm unsure if it's related to the ""responsive table"" widget. The less CSS boilerplate we add, the easier it'll be to configure the table to look different per website, and then our widget handles the hard part without doing all that much, visually. Our docs styles should style the table attractively but I'm not sure whether those styles should be part of the framework CSS at all.

Per the final bullet, The table isn't functional yet, so that makes sense :)

Just some very quick 1st feedback... 
On FF16.0.2, when the screen is wide enough for the full table to be displayed, the ""Rating"" heading appears with a strange underline (let me know if you need a screenshot). This does not happen in Safari (Mac OSX)
Then, I would probably replace ID with id and TH with th (all still in a &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt; block ), for consistency with the rest of the docs.
Finally, in the sentence: ""In reflow mode, you want to pick at minimum width at which the entire table will fit comfortably..."", should the first <strong>at</strong> be replaced with <strong>a</strong> (so the sentence would read ""In reflow mode, you want to pick <strong>a</strong> minimum width at which the entire table will fit comfortably"")?

Can you explain your reasoning for using strong here? These elements are purely for visual aid and are not exposed to any assistive technologies. In this case, I believe we've used `b` in accordance with HTML5's recommendation:  stylistic offset.
",scottjehl,jerone
5093,2012-11-01 15:29:04,"Hey @jerone!

Using the `b` tag actually makes sense here, semantically. `b` conveys that the text is stylistically offset from the surrounding text, without implying any additional importance—I admit it’s a pretty dubious sort of “semantic meaning,” but so says the spec.

By using `b`, we’re allowing the semantics of the parent `th` and `td` to define the contents of the `b` tag, unmodified. By using `strong` we’d effectively be saying “EVERY HEADING IS VERY IMPORTANT,” which is unnecessary. That may be the case in individual use cases, but we don’t want to assume it across the board.

You raise an important issue, and it's something I've considered while working on this. 

I'm primarily addressing/normalizing/improving the browser's concept of navigation because at some level in the library and for other developers at large it all has to boil down to that anyhow. That is, when we get to the point that we have many page containers, they will have to derive their ""navigation state"" from a single url change event even if it's associated with complex state in the background. 

I think that dealing with what a page container does when it get's a ""navigate"" event is a bit further down the stack and later in the refactor, but I have a branch that started out allowing arbitrary objects as the trigger point for the nav event and I ran into a complexity wall when considering the issue with page containers. 

Hopefully we'll be able to derive the correct information with these tools at the page container level, and provide a second derivative event that applies only to a given container. Or at least that's my current thinking.

Some late night thinking on using `$(window)` as global object with pageContainers:

(1)
I'm using two layers of JQM pages (wrappers and nested), so a page with containers would look like this. 



While I figured out a way to use JQMs current navigation to work with this setup, I like the idea of using `$( window )` as top-level object ""managing"" different types of pages (single page, multipage, pageContainers) vs having wrappers and nested pages. Much less confusion. 

(2)
Also, I ran into a lot of trouble when going from a page with pageContainers to another page with pageContainers.

Say you have:



If you navigate:



This can be fixed by exposing `documentUrl` and `documentBase` and resetting both when pulling in a new wrapper page with different `data-url` than the current  `documentUrl`. 

Again, I think running the navigation from the `$(window)` object would spare a lot of complexity here as you would always works from a global object.

(3)
Your approach feels like delegating from `$(window)` to a target container, which also sounds right. 

Say you'd use the `<body>` and pageContainers as ""viewports"", you should get a trackable path through the application as pages will either be loaded into the `<body>` or a `pageContainer`. There are a few caveats in reverting this in the history, but I tried with up to 4 panels and the same set of rules always apply.

(4) 
The only drawback I see is you would loose the option of having a global header/footer if widgets can't be initialized outside of a page.

Say you are using a wrapper page vs. running things from `$(window)`:



I guess once popups will be available globally, global toolbars won't be far behind, so I don't think this is really a problem down the road. 

Therefore:   `$(window)` would get my vote!

5091,2012-10-23 15:49:38,"@johnbender: thx. 

One important point I want to add:

(5) 
Best reason for using `$(window)` is if you can manage to handle the last backwards transition on a container, which currently is a nightmare of excepctions for me. 

Using above example:



Loading this page will create an entry for `base.html` in the `urlHistory`. If you do this:



you will get a 2nd entry in the `urlHistory`, which will be `three.html`. 

Now go back. You don't have `two.html` in the urlHistory.

What happens is inside `$.mobile._handleHashChange` you will end up with no `to` defined, so JQM will try to reload the first page `base.html` vs. reverting the last panel transition, which blanks the pageContainer in question.

I spend forever on this and I spare you the details, but you need a fwd/backwards transition counter, have a terrible check for the last panel backwards transition, hijack the trailing hashchange (it trails nothing, cause there is no `to` ), convert the trailing hashchange object to a string, have it pass so you get a transition, block everything it triggers and clean up the mess it makes in the urlHistory afterwards. 

This handler is about half of my panel navigation, so if using `$(window)` can catch the last backwards transition on a container and if the navigation has a handle for ""no to defined"", you should save yourself a ton of headaches.

We'll have to revisit that issue once I get this merged so I can fully understand it. It sounds like what we need in that case is a history stack per page container, which is something I had planned to push down to the container widget (1.4)

5091,2012-11-30 18:27:23,"@toddparker 

Per your request an executive summary of the nav work:

There are two new additions to the navigation functionality in jQuery Mobile. A `navigate` event that normalizes the URL alteration events `hashchange`/`popstate`, and a `$.mobile.navigate` method that allows users to receive extended traversal information in `navigate` bindings (eg, directionality).  

The `navigate` event is a light weight attempt to unify bindings to a browser's URL alteration events `hashchange` and `popstate`. It also handles differences in the way setting the hash on the location object interacts with the two browser events (ie, stop the world `popstate` triggering) , and provides event hooks to control the event lifecycle.

The `$.mobile.navigate` method forms the bulk of the new functionality. By using the `$.mobile.navigate` method to do url manipulation instead of doing it directly with the `location` object, `replaceState`, or `pushState` you get history management and support for both modes of URL state tracking. The history management provides a state object to `navigate` event bindings whether the browser supports the new history API or not. In addition it contains the same logic used in jQuery Mobile to determine what direction the browser history is moving. 

Both the event and the method are available as modules apart from other navigation functionality in jQuery Mobile, with minor dependencies on other parts of the library.

I can confirm this issue, but have no idea yet what adds the width of the panel to the page width.
There will be a new widget ""sliding panels"" in 1.3 (see #5163) and that's a much better way to get a panel like we shown in that popup example. You won't see this issue with this new widget (I already tested it).
For 1.3 we will also renew the docs and the popup panel example won't return.
I think it has more use to invest time in good demos for the new panel widget, than fixing this issue so I am closing this ticket if you don't mind. When I find out what was causing it, I will post here.

@toddparker I don't think the pointy back button is an iOS only feature, sencha touch for example has it too and many others so I don't believe this would be copying iOS at all, it's just good UI which I believe jQuery is trying to provide (and is doing so very well). I guess we'll just have to wait for better css mask browser support to see a good cross platform solution or use images :(.

You said you followed the instructions on this [page](http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html), but I don't see the issue you mentioned when I test our [working example](http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dynamic-samples/sample-reuse-page.html).

We need a test page to see if this is a bug or a problem with your code. See [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#test-page) for a link to our JS Bin template.
",jaspermdegroot,milantopalov
5085,2012-09-26 09:49:44,"@azicchetti 

If I click that link I get to see the category overview page (""Select a Category Below""), as expected.
The category ""animals"" is only generated and injected in the category overview page when the link is clicked. So even when the url says `?category=animals` you won't land at a page that shows this category.

I am not sure what you mean by #home page in this case.

Also, I don't get a ""Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression:"" error as you mentioned and the `pagebeforechange` event is fired.
",jaspermdegroot,azicchetti
5085,2012-09-26 10:11:32,"Uhm, no, that's not the expected behavior.
The purpose of the whole javascript pagebeforechange handler was to let the user land on the destination page even if it's generated on the fly.

If we have a multipage template, with two pages (#onw and #two), it's possible to deep link the second page and make it work as a straight url.
For instance:
        http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1/docs/pages/multipage-template.html#two
Even if #one is the first page, the second one is shown thanks to the #two hash in the url.

Similarly, we need a way to do the same thing with parameters that are appended to the hash, such as #two?foo=bar or #category-items?category=animals.

Until 1.1.1 we could bind to the pagebeforechange event, parse the data.toPage property and do some ""magic"" (e.preventDefault, trigger a programmatic changePage to a certain page div, etc).

The bug described by @milantopalov is strictly related to #5080.

To further prove the point, take the previous example with jQM 1.1.1:

http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1/docs/pages/dynamic-samples/sample-reuse-page.html#category-items?category=animals

vs

http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dynamic-samples/sample-reuse-page.html#category-items?category=animals

The same page leads to different results, the first (w/ 1.1.1) being the right one.

Hope everything is clear now, it's a kinda diffucult topic ;)

5085,2012-09-26 11:09:52,"Hi @gabrielschulhof ,
I'm the author of one of those plugins, so I have a good understanding of this topic.

I'm aware that jQM won't support query parameters natively, since the previous behavior was more of a bug than an intended feature.

But the sample-reuse-page contains a certain pagebeforechange handler technique, which is the basis on which we can develop routing plugins.

Unfortunately, with 1.2.0-rc\* versions, we don't have the _first_ pagebeforechange with the string url anymore and thus we can't add support for query parameters to deep links (see #5080).

5085,2012-09-26 16:57:51,"@azicchetti 

We'll have to address this in the first point release but we've got some other things to deal with there as well, so it's likely to be released fairly quickly.
",johnbender,azicchetti
5085,2012-09-28 00:20:16,"@azicchetti I'm working on this in a branch. I may just end up addressing the original issue but I have to have a chat with @jblas first.
",johnbender,azicchetti
5085,2012-10-01 16:48:29,"@azicchetti 

Let me address each in turn:
1. The framework will now retain the original url and query params from the hash. So there's no need to do that manually. 
2. The goal is to pass the full resolved url. If this is failing then I'll have to take another look at why. I'd like the property to be consistent across `pagebeforechange` calls and I'm still thinking about where it should be and what it should be called. This may involve deprecating other older params.
3. I'll address this directly (re-opening)
4. Yes this is the ""official way"", I would bind to `pagebeforechange` and set that option where necessary, and you can obviously set it when calling `changePage` directly: 


",johnbender,azicchetti
5085,2012-10-01 16:49:04,"@azicchetti 

Most importantly, thank you for all your help. It makes it much easier to get this right early when application developers participate as you have!
",johnbender,azicchetti
5085,2012-10-01 17:03:56,"@azicchetti 

On number 1 I'd like to change my response :)

We've got a lot of code that makes url's absolute for different circumstances (links, forms, etc) and then a fallback in `loadPage` that deals with relative urls that come from programmatic `changePage` or `loadPage` calls. I'll have to think about push this up the stack a bit for consistency's sake.
",johnbender,azicchetti
5085,2012-10-01 17:39:56,"@azicchetti 

I'm going to move the attribute up to the the data object, it doesn't makes sense (and I knew this when I started) as an option value. Thinking about `data.url`. Simple enough.
",johnbender,azicchetti
5085,2012-10-01 17:52:00,"@azicchetti 

I pushed a change that will push our resolution of the absolute url on the data object as the `.url` property. Let me know if this works for you.
",johnbender,azicchetti
5085,2012-10-01 18:57:06,"@azicchetti 

I simplified things so that the absolute url will always be provided in both the page loading and page changing events on the data object at `data.absUrl`. This way you don't have to do anything crazy to get the value.

To be clear, if `changePage` is called with a string you'll have access to the absolute URL both times when `pagebeforechange` is fired. If `changePage` is called with a jquery object there's nothing to be done as we can't manufacture a url for it so the value will be undefined. I may consider defaulting it to the data url.



As to your last question the `options` will be preserved across them, but we reserve the right to steal your object property for our own use in the options object. To be safe I would namespace it with something we're not likely to override `data.options.mydatayoucanttouch.foo`.

5069,2013-08-07 14:01:25,"@dahool - brilliant!

I came across this post while researching an apparent issue between JQM Dialogs and PRG (Post/Redirect/Get) patterns in general.  In my application in particular, I have a dialog that displays an add/edit form.  The add/edit form is POSTed to itself to be validated.  It is then redirected to a GET route where it displays a success message (or validation errors) and allows for further edits.  I updated the code snippet above to be compatible with the 1.3-stable branch and also modified it to be a one-liner.     



That code change, combined with a data-history=""false"" on the form element, fixes the issue I was seeing (basically the same as #3227 and #3226) and it doesn't seem to cause any issues in the rest of my application.  Awesome, thanks @dahool!  

In the current 1.3-stable branch (1.3.3-pre) it looks like 53 of the sequence-path1-path2-dialog-hash-key-tests are failing (with or without the above change in place).  But, I was able to run all the other tests successfully and none failed.

Seems like the design would look nicer if you set the widths of things do the width doesn't need to shift.

Inclined to close this as won't fix, but want to gather some opinions.

5064,2012-09-22 20:03:06,"@toddparker - You might be right unless we can get it to reposition gracefully (maybe a nice smooth fade out and in or slide over to where it needs to be).  I submitted a pull request prematurely, so I closed it.  The fix I came up with was repositioning it to ""window"" which probably isn't desired if the popup was originally opened with a particular origin selector.  

I guess you might be right about setting the width of things so the width doesn't need to shift (and constrain it to the same width so it doesn't try to expand if the text is wider than the original width).

5040,2012-09-26 23:30:36,"Hi @toddparker ,

After tinkering some I did manage to get it all to position pretty correctly. The 'only' case where there's an issue on the demo page is the one which is `data-position-to=""window""` 
I'm doing a rudimentary check to see if an image is close to the bottom of the document and in that case nudging it's positioning up a little.  The other pop-ups seem to grow the document height so that's not an issue.

Not sure if this is worth pursuing at all?  In the bin I'm only doing modification if the UA tests true for Opera Mini and then adding an event on the clicking of the `data-rel=""popup""` links but we could perhaps refactor that to do that in the codebase to look just before render which would give us the benefit of working with the programmatical instantiated popups too.

The whole scenario's far from ideal really but I think it's going to be bewildering in the least when pop-ups don't appear to show.

5018,2012-09-18 12:43:26,"hi @jasondscott !

@MauriceG and I already had a nice discussion about making it possible to set a default icon for listviews. See #4582.

I think we should keep things simple for users and not add new options if not really necessary. So I suggest to stick to one option ""icon"" with the following possibilities:

default = ""arrow-r""
1. [global] override the default for all listviews by using the `$.mobile` object
2. [UL/OL] override the default or global with `data-icon` on a listview _OR_ with the option `icon` if that listview is created programmatically
3. [LI] override any of the above for a list item with `data-icon` on that specific list item

This could be done with the following additions / changes:

",jerone,gabrielschulhof
5009,2012-11-26 11:56:55,"After a discussion with @uGoMobi we've come up with two possible solutions for adding active states to those buttons (be they links or form elements) that will cause the browser to tear down all of jQM as it shows a page via an HTTP request.
1. The CSS-based approach: We create a new class (ui-btn-active-remove - naming is up for discussion, of course) that is a CSS transition which basically negates the modifications introduced by ui-btn-active, but does so after a while. We apply this class during nav's click handler, when we determine that following the link would result in HTTP navigation. A central sumbit handler similar to the click handler might have to be added so we can also deal with form buttons that have had ui-btn-active added to them. We identified several consequences with this approach:
   1. The source page might become littered with applications of the class ui-btn-active-remove if the user repeatedly navigates over HTTP, then returns to the jQM page containing the HTTP links. The presence of these classes would have no visual effect, but it would be ""unsightly"". We could clean up during the click handler with a $( "".ui-btn-active-remove"" ).removeClass( ""ui-btn-active-remove"" ) if that turns out not to be expensive. For browsers that do not support CSS transitions, the application of ui-btn-active-remove would have the effect of immediately removing the modifications applied by ui-btn-active, so for those browsers [this issue](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5009) would not be fixed.
   2. There might be bugs similar to the problems that prompted introduction of popup interruptible transitions. For example, there is a (Chrome) browser bug that was not filed whereby, when clicking an AJAX link from a popup that leads to another page and later returning to the page containing the popup, one would see the final stages of the popup's closing transition on the source page, even though the time interval during which the closing transition was supposed to complete is much shorter than the time spent on the page opened from the popup.
   3. The class ui-btn-active-remove might have to be themed, and we'll have to apply one of ui-btn-active-remove-[a-z] at the time of vclick.
   
   _This approach hinges on the fact that we can essentially achieve the effect of removing .ui-btn-active by adding the class .ui-btn-active-remove and, furthermore, defining ui-btn-active-remove in such a way that, where browsers support CSS transitions, the transition is used to achieve the effect of removing ui-btn-active, and where browsers do not support CSS-transitions, the basic properties of the ui-btn-active-remove class will have the effect of removing ui-btn-active._ @Wilto should be able to weigh in here.
2. The [unload](http://api.jquery.com/unload)-based approach (as @jerone suggested): During the central click routing in jquery.mobile.navigation.js we make the determination as to whether we should handle a link via AJAX or whether we should let the browser handle it the normal way. At this point, if the decision is to let the browser handle it, we could add a one-shot unload handler that would remove the active state added during the central vclick handler the same way as the hashchange handler would remove such an active state. We might also have to introduce a central submit handler so as to add this one-shot unload handler for submit buttons as well.
   
   The challenge with this approach is that we must test that the unload event works reliably on all our supported platforms.

This only occurs on the initial state, that is a refresh. For all other back and forward combinations it does re-use the dialog hash key. I guess I'm not convinced that there's an enormous amount of value to making this kind of change this late in the release cycle.

Also, as I pointed out in the commit message, we can actually make use of the id reference that's currently included to ensure a hashchange when we want to re-use the current dialog state. That is if the default when a popup is clicked looks something like:

`http://foo.com/` --- click popup link ---> `http://foo.com/#foo&ui-state=dialog`

We can check if we're on the initial page and the location.hash is a match for the hash we're creating and just strip the id from it:

`http://foo.com/#foo&ui-state=dialog` --- click popup link ---> `http://foo.com/#&ui-state=dialog`

That would, at most, be a 2 to 3 line change, and accommodates the ""reuse"" of the existing hash. Also, it's not clear to me that we shouldn't use the identifier for popup hash state when we can since the semantics add value to the url.

Thanks for reporting the issue. I can confirm this, also on Safari for Windows.

There seems to be a problem with the stack order on Safari with certain transforms. I have seen similar issues being reported on the web. The only way I could work around the issue was adding translateZ to the animation, like so:



With a value of 1px the popup will be in front of the video but the animation doesn't really good when used with a background overlay. When setting a value of 1000px this is solved, but then dialog/page transitions go crazy on Safari.
Whatever value is used, it didn't seem to have negative effects on Chrome.

This is just because Opera Mini doesn't support the placeholder attribute.

The solution you linked to is setting the value attribute if placeholder isn't supported and reset the value when you start typing in the input field and on submit. This might be suitable in your case but I can also think of situations where it causes problems. E.g. if you check at client side if a user has filled out all required fields of a form.

So I don't think this is something we should add to the framework but more a solution that you can include yourself if you are planning on using placeholders and want to support browsers browser like Opera Mini or older versions of IE.

It might work a bit different than expected on Opera Mini. See this issue: #4311.

4965,2013-08-27 07:47:04,"@koracz Firstly, this is not the correct place to come for help regarding using the library, this is the place for constructive suggestions regarding the codebase.  For help in future I recommend you go to the [forum](https://forum.jquery.com/jquery-mobile) or stackoverflow.  

As with anything, hoping for a solution by not reading the manual is a stupid idea and a waste of everyone's time when you criticise the framework for your lack of knowledge.  There is no inconsistency as you mention, the same applies to the framework knowing what new html you want to put in the dialog.  It doesn't auto-magically know you want to replace html.  **You** tell it to by a method just the same as **you** have to with firing the `create` event.  The reason that these events don't auto-fire on every single DOM manipulation is that the computational overhead is relatively expensive, particularly on a mobile device and hence the developer can decide when he/she is done augmenting the DOM and when it's best to trigger the `create` event.  So if you are concious enough to have added in HTML dynamically, you should be concious enough to trigger the `create` event at a time which is most suitable.

The very reason that the codebase does this is to make applications built on the framework better for the end-user.  Hence I can't see this being a valid feature request as it would slow down the responsiveness of the framework for everyone else, all the time, when all it needs is for developers to read the manual!

4965,2013-08-27 08:46:58,"@koracz
I disagree with you. 
1. If library behave inconsistently (different output between two calls) its a BUG.
2. Searching for JQM on stackoverflow suggest that either yours documentation is not good enough either yours code base is not good enough.
3. ""hoping for a solution by not reading the manual is a stupid idea""  - maybe for you, my experience shows that its cheaper to first to try a solution then to read about solution, especially if you must remember thousands of tricks from manual. 
And ... don't be like a child. If somebody complain about your lib, its good because its useful enough to make effort for complaining. 
",koracz,koracz
4965,2013-08-27 09:09:13,"@koracz 
In reference to your points:-
1.  How is it behaving differently between 2 different calls?
2.  That isn't the case, many people who need a little more help understanding something go to stack overflow and ask how to make something work.  In anycase I would try to answer your question(s) there too as I did here, it's just there it is more appropriate for your ""question"".  If you are suggesting it is a bug then please file an [issue here](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues) according to the appropriate guidelines.
3.  I never thought you were complaining!  I thought you wanted help and I was getting frustrated that even though I am taking the time to help you out ""cheaply"" with providing fiddles and my time/expertise, you are not being clear or specific about what you exactly want.  I have given you the correct way to do what you wanted originally and explained why it's done that way.  As for ""thousands of tricks from the manual"", I appreciate what you are saying there but in any framework there are certain nuances that need to be learned before you can craft quality.  Perhaps to rephrase what I mentioned earlier and I speak for myself as I am only an infrequent visitor to these pages but use the library regularly: I think the whole point of why jQM does this is to allow a light-weight and responsive framework to be implemented for the benefit of the many(user) by the expertise invested in by a few (developer).  Otherwise we might as well stick with HTML as then a developer needn't even have to learn javascript or any other language for that matter ""cheaply"".

If I understand you correctly you mean automatically apply layout grids (http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-grids.html).

The framework has a grid function that adds the grid and block classes. This is used for the navbar, but you can use this function for other markup as well.

You can specify the number of columns with the option `grid` (a=2, b=3, c=4, d=5 columns). The framework does not contain CSS for more than 5 columns.



Here is a code example: http://jsbin.com/ikisux/7/edit

If you just call `grid()` without options or set option `grid` to `null` the function will count the number of child elements. If this is more than 5, grid ""a"" (2 column) will be applied.

Keep in mind that it's just a function and not a real widget. So a method like `grid( ""refresh"" )` won't work. See ticket #2126.

We will add this information to the docs.

Important note: There was a bug in this function. In 1.1.1 and earlier versions specifying the number of columns does not work. This is fixed in latest code and 1.2.

4956,2012-09-10 19:45:31,"Hello, thanks for your answers and the time spent.
I know the grid feature, but I would really need this as a list to benefit from the filter option.
As @frequent also said it, I would love it to automatically adapt to the screen width.
The idea is to have items that are automatically put in a ""grid layout"" but without knowing the items widths (that should be a parameter) and the screen width, even if you don't know in advance how many items you have and without the limitation of 5 items per rows.

Thanks again.

Correction. We haven't ever supported the navigation to embedded pages with query parameters. This is actually one of our most requested features:

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2082

The reason this worked for you was that Sizzle (the selector engine inside jQuery core) was more permissive in previous releases and allowed selectors with `?` embedded in certain cases. That is, on load we passed the hash directly to the selection engine to retrieve elements in the page that matched it (embedded pages), if one was found that was loaded but the change to jQuery Core (specifically Sizzle the selection engine) prevented unescaped hashes with things like `?` so we switched to `getElementById`. Trying to find `<div id=""test1""/>` with `document.getElementById( ""#test1?foo=bar"" )` obviously won't work.

If you go to the dev2 subdomain link (NO BUG) that you provided and try the following two selectors 



You'll see that the first on borks while the second one doesn't! 

Obviously none of this really helps you, but as a work around, before jQuery or jQuery Mobile is loaded in the page, you could alter the hash by striping the query params so that the initial page will be selected properly from the document:



I'm going to close this issue but I'll keep checking back to help you with a workaround.
",johnbender,jjunkin
4943,2012-09-18 00:21:42,"@jjunkin 

Actually you'll need to do a page refresh after you alter the hash to avoid issues with the initial history entry:


",johnbender,jjunkin

",johnbender,jjunkin
4943,2012-09-18 16:30:43,"@gabrielschulhof 

It shouldn't work if there's a `?foo=bar` attached (eg, `#baz?foo=bar` ) to the hash of an embedded page, since `document.getElementById` wont find anything. Do you mean that it works for just `#baz` ?

Thanks for all of the insight. I guess I should probably switch to the router plugin anyway as my router is a mess. I appreciate the clear explanation.

It may be a good idea to make a clear note on the dynamic page example that the parameters demonstrated will not work directly. I realize it is documented elsewhere but the example demonstrates the use of parameters without the caveat.

",johnbender,jjunkin
4943,2012-09-25 20:46:16,"I've run into this exact same issue. What I'm creating is a mini web app that uses json data to compose the content. Pretty much like what's described in this example: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0-rc.1/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html

Project is relatively simple, there's no server generated pages, only the json data, but since it's running in a mobile web browser, page reloads are something to be expected. For now I'm using JQ1.7.2 and JQM1.2.0.alpha1 where page reloads work as expected, but this discussion makes me a bit worried about any similar future projects. This really sounds like there's been an architecture change where this behavior won't be possible anymore :\

@johnbender
I've tried what you've suggested here, but it just reloads the page over and over (as I thought it would...)

<pre><code>location.hash = location.hash.replace(/\?.*$/, """");</code>
<code>location.href = location.href;</code></pre>

When I only use this, 

<pre><code>location.hash = location.hash.replace(/\?.*$/, """");</code></pre>

Then as expected it removes query from the URL, and only the hash remains, which does cause at least the correct page to show up, but doesn't allow for proper deeper page reloads, linking or bookmarking. If that's the best workaround we can get, it's almost as bad as no workaround at all, I'm afraid :(<br>

I've done a bit more investigation on what happens on page reloads, and I've noticed that with JQ172 and JQM120a, there's two pagebeforechange events firing: First one has data.toPage as a String, the other one has it as an Object. In case of JQ181 and JQM120 post-alpha only one event is fired instead, the one where data.toPage is an object (which contains no data useful for rebuilding the URL).<br>

This is the reason why Router plugin now fails as well. Much like the JQM dynamic page example, Router code relies on this check: (typeof data.toPage === ""string"") to know when to do its work. But this will never evaluate to true on a page refresh in new JQM anymore :\

_// Pages are lazily enhanced. We call page() on the page

I read the same as well. But that still didn't explain difference between trigger('create') vs. page(). This example only address listview. How about other kinds of elements? I would like to understand the whole background.

Etlo
",etlolap,MauriceG
4921,2012-09-03 00:07:42,"@etlolap 

Page, listview, each of the form elements, etc. are all plugins. To enhance a component the applicable plugin has to be called like `page()`, `listview()`, etc..

However, the framework includes auto-initialization of plugins. When a page is enhanced (`pagecreate` event fires) all components on that page are enhanced as well (functions bound to the `pagecreate` event call the plugins).

Besides `pagecreate` those functions are also bound to the `create` event. When you dynamically add components to a page after it was already enhanced you can trigger this event on an element (e.g. the page element) to enhance the new components that are children of that element. 

So the `pagecreate` and `create` events are used to enhance components on a page, but not a page itself.

The reason you got that error with listview and not with the form element plugins is that listview requires an enhanced parent page. You trigger `create` on the page element which results in a call to the listview plugin, but that page element is not an enhanced page yet.

I think in your case binding to the `pagebeforecreate` event is more appropriate than the `pagebeforechange` event. The latter is fired after a call to `$.mobile.changePage()` which is actually part of your callback. I wonder how that works.
You can read more about events here http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html.

Although we do want to make it possible to enhance a listview outside a page, I don't consider this issue as a bug but a problem with your code. I hope my explanation is clear and that it helps you to make it work for you.

It's hard for us to tack the base tag value and know when it's been changed. Though we could for instance say ""It's different than what we have recorded from the page load, don't touch"".

I've modified the popup's ""popupbeforeposition"" event. It now passes along a structure that contains the positioning data it will use upon repositioning. So, basically the same stuff you would pass to open (x, y, positionTo). You can modify this structure to get the effect you want:



Note that a value of ""origin"" will not work as the value for data.positionTo, because the information about the origin (that is, the link associated with the popup) has been lost by the time popupbeforeposition rolls around. But, if you tag your link with an ID, you can pass it into positionTo, and it will be used to centre the popup over the element selected by it.

I have just encountered the exact scenario described by @Zlatkovsky. 

From a UI perspective I think what he's saying makes a lot of sense. It's a shame that tap and taphold are tightly coupled. 

It should be up to the developer/designer to decide how to handle each event separately or together; it should be an option.

Perhaps there is an opportunity here for an option setting in the jquery mobile code. By default the behaviour remains as it is today but by setting an option one could decouple the events. Something like 



That would preserve backwards compatibility and also allow other such as myself and Zlatkovsky to design the app in the way that makes sense for our use cases.

Adding a prevent default to the click allows the popup to close:



Calling the close method simply fires a `window.history.back()`. Creating a history even/operation based on another history event or operation (your click binding) seems to be the issue. Obviously using a `preventDefault` breaks the link for the purpose of opening the external applications. Alternately if you let the navigation event take place and then close the popup it works just fine:

After some discussion with @scottgonzalez we may want to avoid detection here and change the semantics of the object property to reflect its purpose as a detection of ""old"" IE versions. We don't have a use for detection of version 10 as yet, and this isn't a public API.

4865,2012-08-23 16:12:55,"@frequent - this is a very cool idea. I really like the idea of just using data-type=""horizontal"" on the collapsible sets to make a tab. Two bits of feedback:
- I think these should default to not showing an icon, just like we do for the horizontal checks/radios. Maybe if you set the icons explicitly for the expanded/collapsed, we can show them but by default, not having icons leaves more room for text and makes these look more like tabs. 
- Since there isn't a physical connection between the header and content as there is in an accordion, I'd like to apply the active class to the expanded collapsible to show an on state.

Is this coded to handle any number of tabs (within reason)?
I also wonder if we should apply a content theme by default or just document that you should add this.

Sounds good. I agree with the icons (need a lot of space, will try to remove) and content-theme (make an option). I have set it up for 4 tabs right now, but maybe it can be done like the navbar to wrap to multiple lines (checking). Active state should already by there. I might have overwritten the CSS to not show it (also checking).

",frequent,toddparker
4865,2012-09-10 19:29:37,"@uGoMobi, @toddparker: need your feedback on some points.

1) (done) - keep active class on active collaspibles
2) (done) - if not specified, tabs are without icons by default
3) (need input!) - **max number of tabs**: This is tricky... 5 is no problem, also breaking to multiple lines if more than 5 tabs (same as navbar). I have been fiddling with another approach  ([dummy](http://www.franckreich.de/p/test.html)), where I'm trying to get by without setting any width/min-width on the tabs and just expand depending on text size while breaking to multiple lines on smaller screens. I have pretty much tried all CSS trickery I know but I can't fill the top row gaps when the screen shrinks. Do you have any idea if this is possible at all? If so, I would try making element four and five into first and last, so they would shrink/grow independently (so I can set corners). 

Todos:
4) (will do next) data-inset not working yet
5) (will do next) set up with/without data-content-theme
6) (what do you think?) **data-icons-only=""true""** on small screens if icons are specified on all collapsibles 
7) (what do you think?) **data-bottom-bar=""true""** to add a footer to the content section (sample coming up)
8) (what do you think?) **data-tabs=""left|right|bottom|top""** just an idea, but I saw a nice native app using sidebars along header/footer. I would give it a try and see if this is settable with a class and CSS, so the tabs would be the sidebar.

1 & 2 - Great. Is there an updated demo?
3 - I can see this getting complex. I'd vote to just to just max be 5 to avoid needing to stack to multiple rows because that's not good UI. 
4 - this will be a good one to get working
5 - this should work without, but I can see us recommending that they use a theme for better visual connection
6 - i see the appeal, but let's just truncate text for now and look at this later
7 - seems like we could just allow people to add a footer to the content and we can make sure the styles look ok. I wouldn't add anything more than that.

Thanks for all the work so far!

I had a look at your sample page and was wondering if we can think of a different approach to make the collapsible content full width and stick to the left. The problem with the fixed width is that you have to set the padding of the collapsible content to 0. Using box-sizing border-box would solve this for most browsers, but unfortunately IE7/8 and WP don't support this.

Forcing the textarea to auto grow can be done with `$( ""textarea"" ).keyup();`.
The problem might be finding the right event to bind to, because I suppose you want the textarea to grow as soon as paste is clicked in the contextmenu. I don't think the ""paste"" event is supported on iOS and the ""change"" event most probably only fires after the textarea loses focus. Maybe ""input"" works. Here is some code you can test with:

I'm concerned that android users are extremely likely to use the back button in the case of a popup. This was the original reasoning behind maintaining the state in the url.

Another solution to achieve same icons for expanded and collapsed state is to use a CSS-rule like this:

for the info icon.

We didn't deliberately disable this functionality, but I won't call it regression either because we never intended to support a link or button inside the collapsible header.
Although the markup is valid, the result is one interactive element wrapped inside another and that is not recommended in general.

4790,2012-08-02 14:58:35,"@slayergirl - I agree this would be ideal. We worked on it for a while but this is really complex. When you change orientations, the thing the popup is centered over (if origin or selector is used) will most likely scroll completely out of view. We then had to manually scroll that element back into view, then re-position the popup which was slow, buggy and looked very jumpy. Since popups were designed to be opened for brief amounts of time, we decided to keep it simple and switch to positioning to the window for an open popup once an orientation change occurred.

In my knowledge, location.toString cannot be overwritten, even if it can do, it will not necessarily work in the future.

I just forgot location.search, location.href without user:pass is
`location.protocol + ""//"" + location.host + location.pathname + location.search + location.hash`

Hi,

user:pass in location.href is dependent on browser's implementation.
Non-webkit browsers remove user:pass in location.href by default.

It is not necessary to consider percent encoding.
I think that just remove user:pass from location.href is no problem at all.

Seems your idea for using encode/decodeURIComponent works in chrome and IE but not FF. 
Firefox likes to automatically decode the url in the address bar thus making a refresh of the page impossible. It seems to only apply the decoding when an encoded character is found, this includes removing the hash which identifies which page jqm should navigate to.
Try putting this url in both Firefox and Chrome/IE and you can see what I mean

This still isn't working....in Firefox the URL displayed in the address bar is still displaying decoded and missing the hash (#)...so when you refresh on the URL, the page doesn't reload. 

There were still a handful of places that were using the location.hash.

I see there is a a second ""new"" way to work around this issue that was implemented, but I don't think its fully solving this problem and I don't quite understand why.

Going back to an earlier post....I got this working myself in the 1.1.1 release by simply just changing **everywhere** that `location.hash` was being **read** with `$.mobile.path.parseUrl( location.href ).hash`

I also went through the stable 1.1.1 release and changed every  `location.hash`, `$.mobile.path.parseLocation().hash` and `path.parseLocation().hash` with `$.mobile.path.parseUrl( location.href ).hash` and its working for me.

Regarding the location.hash only having one more reference, I just found the following areas in the 1.1 stable release where I think the location.hash should be changed to use the `$.mobile.path.parseUrl( location.href ).hash` function.

I suppose you are referring to your comment on #4175.

Can you give a clear description of the problem, including a sample page that illustrates the problem (not the fix) and information like on which platforms/browsers the issue can be reproduced.

Replacing `type=""range""` by `data-type=""range""` in your markup is not a solution. They are completely different things. Because the `type` attribute would be missing, the state of the input would default to `text` and together with the `min` and `max` attributes this will result in invalid markup. The data attribute `data-type` is only supposed to be used internally by the framework.

Actually controlgroup() is just a function that takes options as parameter. It is not a real widget. This means there are no methods like `controlgroup( ""refresh"" )` or `triggger( ""create"" )`. There is just a call to the function: `controlgroup()`.

This is the code in jquery.mobile.init that should make sure controlgroups are enhanced:

Hi John, thanks for looking at  this.  @ninichki already got it working.

I've suggested that Gabriel take a look, because in this case, the popup is called and the click is not ignored, like the docs say.
As often you click the select button in the dialog in the demo above, the URL grows and grows, and after the second click, the dialog is not more closeable.

JQM doesn't handle opening and closing of the native menu. I suppose that if you add `data-role=""none""` to the select element (this means the select won't be enhanced at all) the problem would still occur.

So there is not really a way to programmatically close it. What might do the trick is trigger ""blur"" on the select or focus another element before you navigate back to the login screen.

The second exception appears to be a bug, though we've discussed what to do in the case where something has already been initialized. 

@uGoMobi 

We should look at the widget factory to see if there's a way to tell if the widget has been initialized and then just bail if it has. With `_super` we could just put it in the mobile widget factor (ugh inheritance).

I have a popup that is opened pragmatically. i don't mind the popup being closed by the user and am not worried about back button. i just want the user to have to click either close or next vs potentially closing by accident by clicking outside. 

Also in regards to the backbutton issue here and on issue #4649 This option would solve #4649 in some situations (though not all) on devices without a physical back button (ios) in phonegap or standalone mode this would solve. (not sure how the physical back button works in phonegap in android??) 

finally the situation @gabrielschulhof noted with a popup on a page with hash listening disabled and (if such an option existed) history not being tracked for popup just have it go back to last page in history this seems like what the expected result of such a sequence would be to me. and if this isnt the desired sequence then that would be up to the person creating the pages to handle properly.

Hi, the fix does not work for me because I need to skip the filtering after I injected new data items in the list (I used to change the 'lastval' variable from outside the class but I realize that was an ugly hack so I changed your code a little bit and now it work find and it's clean (I hope) :



Let me explain the modifications: 
first I do need to know what is the value of the input text so I added two parameters to the event you created
(if I don't have this value I can't fill the list with my custom item values)
then when I fill the list with new items (all items are removed then new ones are added) : it means that they don't need to be filtered after.

in my event catch function I call event.preventDefault(); which means skip filtering;



note about filtering : 
why do I added code to chane  val and lastval variables?:
if I don't set val and lastval to """" then a search with accends won't work (exemple : enter ""côte"" the 'ô' would be filtered but I want it to be considered as a regular 'o')

I hope you understand my issues because it's not very easy for me to explain. ;)

Actually we noticed the bug ourselves while we were updating the JQM ThemeRoller to 1.1.1., when it is was already too late to fix this.
This regression is caused by a change we made to have the buttons of the controlgroup always being wrapped in a div with class `ui-controlgroup-controls` (for styling purposes) and not only if there is a legend. What happens now is that each time controlgroup() is called, the div is wrapped again.
Besides a fix I am looking into a temporary workaround for people. If I have one, I will post it in a comment here.

Thanks for posting!

I don't think `ui-btn-right` was intended to be used for something else than single buttons, but that doesn't mean we can't make it work :)
I suggest to focus on the `ui-btn-right` class instead of `ui-controlgroup`, because that is the class which sets the absolute positioning.
If you use a controlgroup in the header without adding `ui-btn-right` you probably do want some top and bottom margin. Actually I think we have to add some left/right margin as well, but that is something else.

What do you think about `.ui-btn-left, .ui-btn-right { margin: 0 !important; }` ?

I noticed your PR #4706 too late, sorry. If I would have known you wanted to create one I would have wait to give you the opportunity.

The reason I don't set 100% width is the 1px border. Although I added box-sizing border-box, we also support IE7/WP7 that doesn't support that property. Since there is padding on the ui-content div this is not a big problem, but if not necessary I prefer `width: auto;`.

No problem. Thanks for looking up that issue.

About #3301. We made changes to standardize the width, margins, etc. of all form elements.

Forms that use ui-field-contain are also full width now on screens 450+px: 22% label and 78% the form element. This last change didn't land in 1.1.1. though. Or actually I changed the 78% back to 60% for that release (commit caa89f9).

This is because it is a maintenance release where we don't want to make big chances in appearance. On master (latest code) and in 1.2 this you will see this change.

The JQM data-role=""button"" means that an element gets button styling. It still can be different things: a link that is used to navigate or a button to control something. Only the latter should have role=""button"".

For 1.4 we are making changes to generated markup for buttons. We are doing this refactor in branch ""next"". Before we add the code that sets the ARIA attribute, I wanted to check some things with you.

Anchor elements with `data-role=""button""` (including dynamically injected back buttons) should always get `role=""button""`, correct?
Button elements will no longer be wrapped in a div, we will just style the native element. Do we need to add `role=""button""` to the `button` element?
Input elements of type button, submit or reset get a `div` wrapper and we make the native element transparent. In this case we should add `role=""button""` to the wrapper I suppose. Is it also important that we remove the ARIA role from the native input element in case the developer has added it in the markup?

There are a few other cases in which I am not sure if we need to add a ARIA role. Those are:
- Anchors that are an immediate child of list items in a list with `data-role=""listview""` are styled as buttons.
- For collapsibles we inject an anchor element in the heading element and style it as button.
- Selects are wrapped in a div that is styled as button. The native select element is made transparent (in case of a native menu) or moved offscreen (custom select menu). 
- For checkboxes and radio buttons we style the label element as button. The native input element is behind that button.

I would really appreciate your input here. Thanks a lot!

To be honest, I didn't know it was possible to trigger ""expand"" / ""collapse"" events either until I looked at the code because of this ticket. So, yes, we do need to add this to the docs (see #4389).

I updated the code a little bit (http://jsbin.com/umajup/7/edit#html), because setting `data-collapsed` to `true` or `false` is not necessary when you trigger ""expand"" or ""collapse"". That was part of my first attempt to make this work.

This sets the class for the body element instead of adding a class. That causes the classes which JQM adds to the body (ui-mobile-viewport and ui-overlay-x) to be removed.

4678,2012-07-12 07:06:42,"@MauriceG Hi Maurice, yes this was a comment related to your 12 PRs for changing scheme to theme, not just specific to this one in particular. Setting the theme will apply a color scheme (i.e. colors that work together, including background color, widget color(s) and text color), so that's why I was saying I think color scheme can be ok. In the case of overlay theme for popup or dialog, then we are talking about just the one color, so maybe scheme is not appropriate. This is a very specific point, and this is why I would like @toddparker 's opinion. Also, throughout the docs we have used swatch, swatch or theme, but never ""color theme"". So that's why I am not in favor of ""color theme"". It will be applied to these docs and also the api docs and I want to make sure we make the right decision here, so that it doesn't get changed more than once. So hopefully we can resolve this today. 

Thank you :)

4678,2012-07-12 12:19:22,"I agree with @agcolom that ""color theme"" is a bit awkward in English and color scheme is probably fine as is. 

If we are going to make a change, I think the best turn of phrase is ""theme color swatch"" (or ""theme's color swatch"" but I think that feels odd for some reason even if more correct) because the theme is the overarching collection and it contains a number of color swatches. I think we use this elsewhere in the docs. 

So:
""Sets the color scheme (swatch) for the popup background""

Would become:
""Sets the theme color swatch for the popup background""

I had to revert the commit because multiple checkboxradio tests failed after landing this PR.

This could be because we have to rewrite the tests so they match the new situation, but it could also be that allowing links inside the checkbox label/button is causing problems in real.

This fix seems to have broken the layout of a navbar and a list combined on android 2.3.x when list text is too long to display.  issue [#4958](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4958)  
For some reason it is interferring with the overflow property of the list on the same page.
I can confirm that the following settings for `.navbar ul'` alleviate the issue of issue #4958 so perhaps substituting one of these will also fix this issue without breaking backward compatibility or we may need to revert back to @johnbender's original javascript solution.  Unfortunately I haven't been able to test on a 4.0.1 device or similar.

It is correct that the persistent fixed headers/footers of the ""toPage"" are not available on that page at the pagebeforeshow event.
This event fires just before the start of the transition animation. Because persistent toolbars are not supposed to be animated into view they are moved from the ""toPage"" already.

This has to do with virtual mouse events. See http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html

The tapToggle function binds to ""vclick"" while your animation is triggered by ""click"". If you change it to `$(function() {$('h1').bind(""vclick"",function() { $('#img').fadeToggle(); });});` both animations kick off at the same time.

BTW - If you don't want tapToggle to be triggered when that text is clicked: there is an option tapToggleBlacklist that you can configure (http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed-options.html).

I had a look at your test page. You set `width: 100%;` on the header image on the first page, but not on page 2, 3 and 4. You don't set a height for the image at all.
Although a fixed header with same data-id appears to stay in view it is actually replaced by the header of the page you navigate to. I don't understand what you mean by ""which leaves duplicate code on multiple pages"". Duplicate data-id is not the same as duplicate id. Only the latter has to be avoided.

I added a class to the header image on all four pages and set `width: 100%; height: auto;` for it and then the header image is rendered the same on every page and doesn't obscure the content: http://jsbin.com/awoluv/166/edit#html
There is no need to call updateLayout and the build in updatePagePadding function makes sure the padding-top on the page is the same as the height of the header.

I also noticed you use `div[data-role=""content""]` twice on the first page. Not sure if it could cause problems, but it is not really intended to be used that way. It also mean you have two divs with role=""main"" on the same page, where there is supposed to be only one.

Ok, so the problem can be described as ""content is placed underneath fixed header"".

If you leave all the other (fluid grid) CSS and JS out, does the problem occur as well?

The updatePagePadding that I described in my previous comment should prevent content being obscured by the fixed header. If you inspect the code, is there padding-top on the div with class `ui-page`?

[Update:] Just to clarify; here at the issue tracker we look at bare test cases, to see if something is a bug in the framework. When it is about getting things to work when you combine JQM with all kinds of other things (boilerplate, fluid grid, etc.) the forum is the right place to ask for help.

If you're a Windows guy the new ""Clone in Windows"" tool from Github might be handy. Never tried it myself though.
Just click the fork button when you are here on the jQuery Mobile repo. That should take you to your own forked repo where you can click the ""Clone in Windows"" button.

The framework doesn't support mini styling for listview. There is no specific CSS for it and the mini data-attribute or option will be ignored. So if you configure buttonMarkup to give listview buttons mini styling anyway you might run into some issues.

Nevertheless, I will give that change another look. If it turns out not to be really necessary I will revert it to `.ui-mini { margin-top: .25em; margin-bottom: .25em; }`.

4644,2012-07-04 14:11:49,"@bernharduw 

I think I already understand what is the issue with the slider handle in your case. The slider widget uses a different class for mini styling (ui-slider-mini). Since you configured button markup the ui-mini class is added anyway. This is causing the issue.

In general I don't think it's a good idea to configure buttonMarkup and would advice to set the mini option for each widget that you use.

The issue I wanted to prevent by adding .ui-btn to the selector is already taken care of by other changes so I am going to revert it.

4644,2012-07-04 15:17:33,"@bernharduw 

Yes, it should be safe to cofigure shadow and icon shadow that way.
The difference with options like mini and inline is that the ui-shadow and ui-icon-shadow classes are defined global in the theme CSS instead of specific rules for each component. The same goes for the corner styling.

You can accomplish this with a bit of custom CSS. The code below will give you this result: http://jsbin.com/otepum/176/



Please note that the CSS for form elements has been updated in 1.1.1. to create consistency in margin/padding between all form elements. This means the text input won't have top/bottom margin anymore when inside a fieldcontain. Be aware of that if you now use 1.1.0. and are going to update.
In my example I used the `p` element which gets the default browser margin before and after.

We can't use tap events for navigation (`vclick`) because navigating moves content. If you move the content on which the tap event was fired _before_ the following click, many browsers will trigger the click on whatever element is under the tap region 300ms later.

Thank you for answer, but as I said, preventing default action is the workaround, at least for iOS Safari (I haven't tested it on Android yet). Anyway, I bet it would be better if you leave the choice for developers, because that additional 300ms make any app sluggish and slow and I think it whittles down all the benefits of using html5 and your great framework for real mobile developement..

Plus I cant see how collapsible toggling can change the content at the tap point, because it's always collapsible header over there, isn't?

I like the idea of leaving it for developers except that unexpected behavior that's extremely hard to explain makes for a poor user experience. We could make it an option on the collapsible prototype and then bind as necessary but I'd put this way at the bottom of our priorities list.

4617,2012-07-04 19:32:46,"@zathrus-writer 

I looked at your test page.

As soon as the transition to the dialog page is finished the pagehide event fires because the initial page with the selectmenu is hidden.
At that moment there is already a problem because if you inspect the code you will see a dialog nested in a dialog. So it seems that the if statement of your function is true at that moment, because it has altered the code already before the dialog is closed.
Note that an empty dialog is created and the content is moved from page with the selectmenu to the dialog page.

The framework removes a page as soon as you leave it except for the first page. For a dialog page that has been created to show a custom selectmenu this is done when you leave the parent page.
I am curious how much memory you save by removing that empty dialog div. Is it worth the trouble? It's really tricky to interfere with the frameworks navigation model this way.

Anyway, this really has to do with your script and not with a bug in the framework. So I am closing this issue and suggest you discuss it on the forum.

I don't see this issue. Here is a test page http://jsbin.com/unusog/12.
If you inspect the code you will see the dialog div is removed after navigating away from the parent page.

The first time I tested on Chrome. I now tested this on FF12 and inspected the code with Firebug 1.9.2.

All dialogs and pages are removed from the DOM after finishing transition to next page, except for page A and the dialog created for the selectmenu of page A.
My version of Firebug updates automatically, but even when I inspect it again I don't see the issue.

Your screenshot clearly shows that something is wrong, so this is really weird. What version of Firefox are you running on what OS? Can you test on Chrome or Safari as well?

No, you can't alter this. There is a configurable option ""buttonMarkup.hoverDelay"" for touch devices, but that only applies to the handle.
Maybe we can change that so it would also apply to the switch area. There are platforms/browsers where you can't control the flip toggle swith by sliding the handle (Opera Mini for example). We have to watch out for not making those unresponsive.

Thanks for reporting the issue.

The cause of this is that the bottom border is only added to the last item of the list by using the :last-child pseudo class selector. That doesn't distinguish hidden and visible elements. So you only see the bottom border in that example when ""Volvo"" is in view, because that is the last item in the original list.

Older browsers like IE7 and IE8 don't support the :last-child selector, so on those you will never see a border at the bottom of the list.

@toddparker - What do you think about changing this to a ""listview last item"" class added by the framework?

I have been thinking about the footer as well. That certainly qualifies as ""subtle"". Downside is that you might find out you have been reading the wrong information only after you reached the bottom of the page.

Something I have been thinking about is adding (small) breadcrumbs at the top of the content div and add the version to the first crumb. For example:

Docs 1.1.1. > Pages > Dialogs

That might also improve the search results on Google. That's another issue mentioned at #3330. Probably best would be if the title contains the version, but I think that would mean we have to hardcode it :(

So whenever a popup opens I add **selDiaPopBlock** to the html element and on pagebeforechange, I'm checking:

4583,2012-07-06 22:41:38,"@agcolom Thanks a lot, that's the expected behaviour, as both the HTML5 and the XHTML5 on jsbin execute the AJAX post request (resulting in an error, which is correct, as the specified URI does not exist). 

**However**, the problem still wasn't solved for the site I was working on. It took some time to figure out why and under which conditions, and it comes down to **the xhr post request not working in XHTML5 IF the page is run locally** (either from the file system or from localhost), at least on Windows 7. Is this a XHTML(5) feature, or a bug?

To replicate, 
- save your jsbin samples as files locally, make sure you make the  HTML5 version's extension ""html"", and the XHTML5 version's ""xhtml"". **Note**: I have provided a valid XHTML5 version, see http://jsbin.com/enewuc/4 
- Now open each local file (or locally served page) in a browser, and you'll see that while the HTML5 version issues an xhr request (leading to an error, which is correct), **the XHTML5 version does not execute the xhr request**, it does nothing (which is bad). I tested this with FF 12, Chrome 19 and IE 9 under Windows 7 and found the behaviour to be consistent across browsers.

Please let me know if you have questions or trouble replicating the issue.

Removing JQM resolves the issue (running on localhost).

Maybe I'm missing something, or I'm doing something terribly wrong...

Hence I've created **three test instances** for you:

- **XHTML5 with JQM** [clicking 'Sign up' **DOESN'T WORK** (nothing happens)] http://form-submit-xhtml-jqm.herokuapp.com/
- **XHTML5 without JQM** [clicking 'Sign up' **works** (leads to an expected error page, ""The page you were looking for doesn't exist."")] http://form-submit-xhtml.herokuapp.com/

The test result noted in brackets was consistent across FF 12, Chrome 19 and IE 9 on Windows 7 (64 Bit).

4583,2012-07-15 16:59:17,"@agcolom Hi Anne,

Thanks for the hint, there were indeed a few minor markup issue that have now been fixed:
- http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fform-submit-html-jqm.herokuapp.com
- http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fform-submit-xhtml-jqm.herokuapp.com
- http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fform-submit-xhtml.herokuapp.com

Despite the (now perfectly valid) polyglot markup, the initial issue remains:
- **HTML5 with JQM** [clicking 'Sign up' **works** (leads to an expected error, ""Error Loading Page"")] http://form-submit-html-jqm.herokuapp.com/
- **XHTML5 with JQM** [clicking 'Sign up' **DOESN'T WORK** (nothing happens)] http://form-submit-xhtml-jqm.herokuapp.com/
- **XHTML5 without JQM** [clicking 'Sign up' **works** (leads to an expected error page, ""The page you were looking for doesn't exist."")] http://form-submit-xhtml.herokuapp.com/

Note that for the XHTML versions, the HTTP response header intentionally sets the _correct_ Content-Type ""application/xhtml+xml"" if the user agent accepts it, and ""text/html"" otherwise.

**Now things get interesting:** For testing, you can force the response header to set the Content-Type to ""text/html"" for the XHTML versions by adding the request parameter ""format=html"" like this: http://form-submit-xhtml-jqm.herokuapp.com/?format=html ... and now the submit works - because the (valid!?) content-type ""application/xhtml+xml"" was changed to ""text/html"", which yields a fourth scenario:
- **XHTML5 with JQM served as ""text/html""** [clicking 'Sign up' **works** (leads to an expected error, ""Error Loading Page"")] http://form-submit-xhtml-jqm.herokuapp.com/?format=html

Is it wrong to expect JQM to work with Content-Type ""application/xhtml+xml""?
Anything else you suspect I'm doing wrong?

4582,2012-07-04 14:56:15,"hi @MauriceG 

I think the default for listview option icon should be `icon: ""arrow-r""` instead of `icon: """"`.

If we make it an option for listview we have to offer the possibility to set it with a data-attribute on the listview, not only programmatically. That's not in your code, right?

The value for the option icon for the call to buttonMarkup is now a very long line with OR statements. I suggest to create a variable.

That variable should be a function that checks if data-icon is set on the listview item. If not it should fall back to the data-icon attribute of the parent listview. If that has not been set as well it falls back to the option which is ""arrow-r"" by default but can be configured programmatically.

BTW - When we make this change we should not forget to update the listview options page in the docs and the data-attribute reference.
",jaspermdegroot,MauriceG
4582,2012-07-07 22:33:59,"hi @MauriceG 

You are right, it does work! Most probably I am the one who missed something here.

Below you'll see the code that I had in mind. This is basically the same thing written in another way, but with one difference.

That is `listIcon = $list.jqmData( ""icon"" ) || o.icon` which is required in this construction to see if `data-icon` is set on the `ul` with `data-role=""listview""`. This is why I thought that part was missing in your PR.

To be honest, I still don't understand how this works in your code. I only see `icon = item.jqmData(""icon"");` which checks if `data-icon` is set on the `li`.
Maybe you can explain it to me.

If I look at http://test.jqmobile.de/js/widgets/listviewSetIcon.js which is loaded by your test page, I see your code how it was after the first commit. It doesn't include the changes of the second commit. Am I right?

I had a look at `_getCreateOptions` and now (finally) understand how this works. Thanks!

When I test your code (after the second commit) I see it works, except for one thing. The `data-icon` set on the `ul` with `data-role=""listview` doesn't override the configured default. I think we do need to check with `listview.jqmData ( ""icon"" )` to make this possible.

We shouldn't use new option names if not necessary, because that is not user friendly. So `listIcon` should be `icon` and if we don't use ""arrow-r"" here as default is should be `null` instead of `""""`.

We have to alter the browser history in some fashion to enable the back button for dialogs. That is, we _could_ use pushState (though I'm not 100% on whether that works with the same url) but it was previously broken in older versions of iOS which is why we use replaceState which requires an already altered url.

You said yourself that if they have to tap back through a bunch of dialogs they're probably using the wrong widget :D

""Dialogs should not be part of url or page history""

I think my confusion arises from the title because they have to be a part of the browser history in some fashion or another to support the back button. Because we have to alter the url _somehow_ to create a new history entry, is the win here not tacking on extra dialog states to the hash? ie confining it to `#&ui-state=dialog` instead of `#&ui-state=dialog`?

Either way we'd likely wait until 2.0 because of the way this breaks backward compat so drastically in terms of behavior.

I can reproduce this on Safari, not on Chrome.

The framework sets padding-top - equal to the height of the header - on the div with data-role=""page"". This updatePagePadding function is bound to the ""pageshow"", resize and transition start events.

It seems like things don't happen in time. I see the padding has been added when I inspect the element, but it isn't applied when the page is rendered. The min-height for the page is incorrect too. We have to look into this.

In the structure CSS there is already a default padding based on the height of default padding [edit: padding --> header]. If you use the same header size for all your pages it can be useful (even when this bug is fixed) to adjust that with custom CSS.



No need to use !important if your custom CSS comes after the framework CSS.

4560,2012-06-23 18:15:13,"@toddparker - I put together two identical jsfiddle examples, one with the .in and .out class definitions from the official 1.1 release and one with the same .in and .out class definitions, but with the animation-fill-mode properties set to both.  I'm not sure if this is something you can save to your iOS homescreen, but I'm definitely seeing the before and after effect of setting the animation-fill-mode properties in Chrome v19.0.1084.56 on OSX 10.6.8.  In the examples, I'm explicitly setting the .in and .out styles in an overriding &lt;style&gt; block that's defined in the jsfiddle below the &lt;script&gt; and &lt;link&gt; tags in the &lt;head&gt;.  That's to show that it is the only difference.  All external script and css files being used are the same.

Here's the jsfiddle with the default .in and .out styles from the official 1.1. release.  

http://jsfiddle.net/P37p6/

You will see the blink forward/back ""glitch"" if you simply click either ""Artists"" or ""Queue"" link from the index page, then click ""Back"" to go back.  Do that a few times and you should see a flash of the index page after transitioning to the Queue or Artists page, and then you should see a flash of the Queue or Artists page when going back to the index page.

First, we aren't _replacing_ the page. The original page is being reaped by the library to prevent DOM bloat. You can disable this globally or on a per page basis.

Otherwise the best recommendation I can make is to differentiate each form validation attempt url and then prevent the reaping. If you happen to be using rails you can take a look here (shameless plug):

http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/jquery-mobile-and-rails.html

under form validation. 

Even if your not using rails that approach is still a valid one. That is, set `data-dom-cache=true` on your form page div element:



And then differentiate the url on each request by appending a url parameter that is incremented on each subsequent request (`attempt=1`, `attempt=2`, etc). This has the obvious downside of leaving the older form attempts in the DOM, but you can reap them manually later, eg when you arrive at a page without the an attempt param.

This creates a new page is the dom for each form submission attempt and as a result supports the back button.

Closing for now because we are aware of this as a feature request, but feel free to post back here to get more help.

Just to be clear. `urlHistory` in your description means the browsers history correct? You're saying that the back button recalls the scroll location for that history entry from the browsers internal representation and sets that before the transition logic runs and sets the value as assigned to `active.lastScroll`?

I'm confused because it also sounds like you're saying that we're doing two scrolls down from the top of the page.

If the former is the case I'm wondering if we can do a comparison and avoid the second scroll when the position ""close enough"".

",johnbender,dcarrith
4543,2012-06-22 02:07:08,"@johnbender - I've become obsessed with tracking down this issue.  But, I think I have exhausted all of my troubleshooting energy.  I simply can't figure out the source of the jump down to the last scroll position of the page we're going back to.  

Here are some of the scenarios I tested and the results.  Maybe you or one of the other devs can make some sense out of it.     

Just so we're on the same page, the call to window.history.back() is in the block of code on lines 1312 - 1316 of jquery.mobile.navigation.js (however, I also removed this piece from the overall equation and the issue still occurs - see the last section starting with ""It's also worth mentioning..."" for more info on that scenario).   

In my test scenario, I have the main index page, an artists page, and an albums page showing the albums for a particular artist.  If I scroll down the list of artists and select one, I get to the albums page.  Then, if I click the back button (my own back button or the browser back button) I see a scroll down to the last scroll position of the artists page before the transition even starts.  

As a quick test, I also set my default transition to 'none' and confirmed that the issue still occurs.  

I also fiddled around with different combinations of the changeHash, hashListeningEnabled and pushStateEnabled settings (set in mobileinit).  For example, I tried this combination:  

$.mobile.changePage.defaults.changeHash = true;
$.mobile.hashListeningEnabled = false;
$.mobile.pushStateEnabled = false;

The erroneous scroll down to last position of the page we're going back to (artists page) still occurs, and so does the update to the location.hash, but the page doesn't transition to the previous page (because the hash listening is disabled of course). 

This is also interesting...Even with $.mobile.minScrollBack set to 1000 in my mobileinit, the erroneous scroll down to last position of the page we're going back to STILL occurs.  However, in that case, when it actually transitions back to the artists page, the scrollTo last position does not trigger since the minScrollBack is set so high.  This kind of makes me think that the issue lies with jQuery itself, or in the browser (I've tested the latest version of Chrome on OSX as well as Firefox).  I have tried console.log'ing the history object right before the call to window.history.back() to see if scroll position is even being tracked by the browser and it is NOT.  So, that leads me to believe it might be an issue in the core jQuery library.  My step through debug sessions always led me to the core jQuery library but then I always ended up getting lost or my script debug session would freeze up (not sure what's going on there).  However, the problematic area seemed to be around line 2940 of jquery-1.7.2.js.  I've also tried using jquery-1.7.1 and 1.7.0 but the same issue occurs.  

It's also worth mentioning that I am also able to recreate the issue by removing the data-rel=""back"" attribute from my back button and adding the following event listener for the back button:

$('body').on('click', '#header-back-link', function(evt) {



});

If I add this line above the call to window.history.back():

$.mobile.urlHistory.ignoreNextHashChange = true;

The erroneous scroll down to last position of the page we're going back to (artists page) still occurs, and so does the update to the location.hash, but of course, the page doesn't transition to the previous page because the hash change is being ignored.

I'll try to get a video screen capture posted on vimeo so you can see what I'm talking about.  I'm curious if anyone has ever noticed this before, or has it just been lumped in with the ""jumpy transitions"" kind of issues.

4535,2012-06-18 23:16:56,"@johnbender: thanks for the feedback.  I guess I was looking at it the other way...you're already tracking history in urlHistory.  So, why not use it in place of window.history.back() since it can solve part of the larger issue (jumpiness) that is probably one of the top reported issues for Android.         

""...the addition of logic to the click handler solves less than 50% of the cases and adds additional complexity in [an] already over complex module""     

Can you elaborate on that statement?  What do you mean by ""less than 50% of the cases""?    

Similarly, I'm not sure what you're referring to when you say ""a solution that resolves this issue in both cases"".  What test cases (both) are you talking about?

",dcarrith,johnbender
4535,2012-06-18 23:26:18,"@dcarrith 

Android devs (as an example group) don't make use of explicit back buttons and google actually counsels developers to omit them from their applications in preference to the hardware back button. In the browser, that means supporting a hash change back through history without any reference to where the event came from. So my totally arbitrary estimation of 50% is meant to capture an enormous set of use cases where this issue will still exist because going back through history happens frequently without an explicit addition of the back button.

Therein lies my interest in a more general solution that prevents us from special casing our back buttons which adds not only code but a requirement for ""code base"" knowledge when dealing with back buttons. That is, with your proposed/pullrequest  you need to know how the framework behaves when someone creates a `data-rel=back` link and also how it behaves when someone hits the back button. 

All that said, I agree with your closing statement. If we can't come up with a way to handle this is both cases then might just need to eat the extra complexity in the interest of improving explicitly included back buttons.

4521,2012-08-27 16:29:23,"@miketaylr - we use 3D support internally as a less-than-ideal diagnostic of a browser's ability to run complex animations smoothly. We introduced this as a way to kick poorly performing platforms like Android 2.x or WebOS from blinking and generally freaking out when attempting (and failing) to run transitions, even relatively simple 2D ones like slide or pop. 

When 3D isn't supported, we kick in a fallback mechanism and default to showing a simple fade transitions which most platforms seem to do a decent job with. All of this is configurable, but these are the defaults.

If Opera mobile doesn't support 3D animations, it's probably not worth adding all this code. If you're moving soon to non-prefixed keyframe animations, I'd rather add those and gain both Opera and IE10 support with one set of properties. What do you think?

- Under form, in the slider input, 1 digit gets cut off from lack of space
  
  Fixed
- Button Outside UI Grid is wider than the other buttons (On all tests this occurred, including computers)
  
  In the current situation buttons have left/right margin by default. This way you can not align them with other components. Therefor I removed that margin and only added it where really needed (i.e. inline buttons and buttons in grids). Only downside of this is that when you combine two or more buttons with a single full width button. The first go in a grid and have margin and the last not. As a ""solution"" I added a note in the docs (part of the first commit above) that when you can wrap a button in a div with ui-grid class and then it will get the same margin.
  I should have mentioned on the test page that I added that button outside the grid on purpose to show the difference.

[UPDATE:] I just found out we have a class ui-grid-solo for this. Will update the note in the docs.
- The 2 Select buttons cut off the text within it on the right (only mobile)
  
  I used this example because the issue I fixed was about the select button being misaligned next to a regular button. Using a custom multiple select menu like this is not really good practise.
  What happens is that the multiple select has class has-count from the beginning, even when the count bubble isn't visible yet. So there is also extra padding. This makes the available space for text so small that some browsers don't even show an ellipsis anymore. Same goes for the three buttons at the top of the grid where I didn't see text at all when testing Opera Mini, but I see similar issues when I resize Chrome browser to smallest possible width.
  I was able to optimize it a little bit, but I don't think we can really fix this.
- Under Control Group, Horizontal, Some of the ""X"" buttons are misaligned or completely out of the box underneath them. Menu Button overlaps Search Button. (Opera Mobile and Mini)
  
  Fixed
- Under Form, Cannot select any ""Choices"" (Full size or mini). The popup menu comes up for a second, than disappears. In the old one it works fine. (Opera Mobile)
  
  I could not reproduce this on the Opera Mobile emulator, but that was after I already made a few changes. So maybe I fixed it without knowing. Other possibility is issues with fiexed toolbars. I changed the header and footer of the test page to inline.
  Can you please test again?

The thing that's keeping me from merging this is that `#foo?bar` is a valid identifier according the spec and HTML5 is actually much more permissive (http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/global-attributes.html#the-id-attribute) in that it requires only a single character and no spaces. So we can't rightfully just strip everything off the hash.

Thanks for the pull request, but I think we have to address query params to embedded pages as a whole to solve this issue. Closing for now, but feel free to post back to discuss.
",johnbender,hansjorg
4493,2012-06-11 18:54:26,"@hansjorg 

I think we should probably add `$.mobile.path` helper that converts hashes to id's by truncating after an invalid character, since `cleanHash` just strips the query separator and everything after it even though `?` is a valid id character (http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-name).

This unfortunately also highlights the bigger issue which is that we don't currently support query params to embedded pages. Your example actually appears to work by accident:



throws an exception, but



returns the page you were expecting for some reason that I haven't take the time to investigate in Core. The reason that `$( ""body"").children( ""#second-page?foo=bar.bak"" );` doesn't work is because `children` interprets the dot value as a class selector.

Thanks for your PR. I agree we should look into how to avoid/minimize that gap. At the same time there are browsers (i.e. BB5 and IE7) where the navbar buttons wrap. It all depends on the available width and how the browser rounds off subpixels.

We have to be very careful with making changes to these percentages and probably need to test first on all supported platforms. I am not saying this is not a good fix, but it's better to address all issues at once before changing anything.

I now understand, after the update from @agcolom, that you don't see the ""down state"" either. This has to do with buttonMarkup.hoverDelay. You can read more about this on this page in the docs http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html

Regarding the active state. You could still use href=""#"" but then you need to make your function add and remove the active class.

See the page in the docs @MauriceG pointed you at. It shows you on which events you can call preventDefault.
In general there is no need to create a pause when you bind to the pagebeforecreate event to manipulate the content. If for some reason this doesn't work for your specific use case, binding to the pagebeforeload event like Maurce suggested could be the solution.

Since this doesn't concern a bug I am closing the issue and would like to refer you to the jQuery forum where you can ask for help.

One quick note here. If you can it's helpful to pull them apart into discrete bits. For example this could be two pull requests, one for caching the `cTypeIsInPut`, and one the calculation changes/other.

At the very least it's good to split those into different commits so they can be dealt with individually. This will probably sit in the queue a while longer until someone gets the time to look over everything and how it interacts, unless you want to split it up.

4456,2012-06-08 01:42:26,"@lthurston - Thanks for sharing that gist, I'm sure this will be helpful for some folks. We normally need to manipulate the baseHref to deal with pages from different directories being pulled into a starting page. In your case, are all pages in a flat list and that's why you don't need this feature? Curious why the current behavior would be an issue if all pages are siblings - seems like the base href would just remain the same on each page.

@johnbender - do you have an opinion on this?
",toddparker,lthurston
4456,2012-06-08 03:31:16,"@toddparker - In my case I have a series of URLs like:

domain.com/mobile
domain.com/mobile/page1
domain.com/mobile/page2
domain.com/mobile/page3

For all pages the base href is ""http://domain.com/"", but JQM expects the base href for mobile/page1 to be ""http://domain.com/mobile/"", which breaks all images and links. If JQM respected the base href value on the page it fetched via AJAX, everything would work fine. My solution of setting the static base href for all mobile seemed like an easier and quicker one to implement.

Note that this would be a problem even if I had the mobile site at domain.com/. It might not be immediately obvious because the problem would start only occurring when I get to the two-segment URL paths:

domain.com - would work
domain.com/page1 - would work
domain.com/page2 - would work
domain.com/page2/page3 - wouldn't work, because JQM would set the base href to domain.com/page2

If there's a better way to solve this problem, I'd be happy to help implement it another way. I'd love to get a solution to this problem into a future release.

Although I kind of think the base href should change based on the value in the header of the page fetched by AJAX, having the option of setting a static value from the first page requested serves as a reasonable override of the default behavior.

I've added the option `$.mobile.dynamicBaseEnabled` to a branch that's available for preview. If you set that to `false` inside a `mobileinit` callback jqm will leave everything alone so your initial base href value will be respected for all links in all pages.

",lthurston,johnbender
4456,2012-08-16 20:55:56,"@johnbender It looks like this solution doesn't work in our case. In the site I'm implementing this on, the homepage of the JQM site is in ""mobile/"". The base href value, however, is simply ""http://domain.com/"". Links to internal pages all begin with ""mobile/"" (for example ""mobile/page1"", ""mobile/page2""). When I click one of these pages, I see the request for the page is to ""http://domain.com/mobile/mobile/page1"". So the URL on the link is still being concatenated with the href value of the link.
",lthurston,johnbender
4456,2012-08-16 21:02:22,"@johnbender That last sentence is wrong. It should say: The href value of the a tag is being concatenated on the relative path of the current page (or so it seems).

",lthurston,johnbender
4456,2012-08-16 21:22:32,"@johnbender Sorry to spam you, I should have got this all into one message.

It looks like the call to getClosestBaseUrl() on line 4115 still returns ""http://domain.com/mobile"", to which ""mobile/page1"" is appended. So, the link ends up being incorrect.

This is the part of the code where, in reviewing my solution, I check to see if $.mobile.staticBaseHref is defined and if so I use it as the base url. Alternatively, with your approach, you could get the base href value from the DOM and stick it into the baseUrl variable at that point, if $.mobile.dynamicBaseEnabled is set to false:



That code change makes it all work for me.

Please have a look at ""Hiding labels accessibly"" on this page http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/docs-forms.html
In general class ""ui-hide-label"" can be added to the field container and ""ui-hidden-accessible"" on the label itself.

In case of checkboxes (and radio) the label element becomes the enhanced button. In that case hidding the label means hiding everything except the native checkbox.
You can use ""ui-hidden-accessible"" on the legend element, not the label. Right now you can't use ""ui-hide-label"" in case of checkboxes and radio buttons, but that will be fixed so it hides the legend instead of the label.

I am not sure if I understood you correctly but in case you want to hide certain elements of the enhanced button you would have to add custom CSS for the corresponding classes (ui-icon for the checkbox and ui-btn-text for ""My label""). If you just want the native checkbox use data-role=""none"" on the input element.

I started a discussion about excluding listview buttons from the rule, but changed my mind.
Ok to merge?

Thanks for reporting.

I created a test page. With version 1.1.0. all events were fired twice when you navigate back. With latest code this has been solved. Still I see ""pagebeforechange"" fired twice though. We have to look into that.
With or without ""allowSamePageTransition"" didn't make any difference.

Thanks for the [PR](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4621)!

There are a few more leaky places you could look at, if you'd like:
- [fixedToolbar](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L117): It does a lot of `$el.closest( "".ui-page"" ).bind( ... )` meaning that, if you remove it from the page, the binding stays attached to the page.
- [navbar](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/navbar.js#L48) also attaches handlers to the closest page, and so it would leak similarly to fixedToolbar
- [loader](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/loader.js#L86) does a bunch of $window.bind(...) and $window.unbind(...), but I can't tell from a cursory glance whether or not it leaves some bindings in place if you were to destroy the widget.

Fixing these should allow us to close this issue.

For me, the flash happens every time, not only on first page load. If you look closely, the flash is due to the header bar being repositioned. You'll notice it better if you scroll just a little bit on page 2 (something like 1/5 of the page) before tapping the back button.

I've tested with iPad 3 v5.1.1, iOS simulator v5.1, iPod Touch v5.1. All the issues are related to the ""to"" and ""from"" pages transitioning from ""scrolled"" positions ( or with pages being longer than the screen height ).
With the toggleViewportClass() css line is commented out, there are a number of scenarios where the transition flashes ( even when  the web app is not launched from the home screen.

Test scenario (reproductible every time):
1. Open webapp (from home screen)
2. Do not scroll, tap the ""slide"" button
3. Scroll just a little bit, so the scroll indicator is about half-way the header (another way of saying the same thing: scroll until the six first lines of text are hidden)
4. Tap the ""back"" button

@ToddThomson Have you already implemented this? I just had a look at http://m.integra-international.net/mobile/test and noticed the new slide transition. Which is very slow, but I assume you're still working on it? Do you plan to send a pull request or is it considered to be just a workaround?

Yes, I've slowed the transitions down for debugging purposes. It has already led to another issue: 4424 (fixed).
User expectations for UI transitions are high due to the responsiveness of native apps = we need to get there with jQM transitions ( fade is good for Lowest Common Denominator hardware, but there is no way I can release a web app that also targets iOS without a working slide (translation) transition ).

I've imposed a change to the jQM page to work around the issues that jQM has with fixed layouts. I've used absolute positioning throughout and specify the [ (top.left), (bottom,right) ] coordinates for each pane. When a page/pane is transitioned out, it is moved ""offscreen"".
Each page/pane has a layout that also uses absolute positioning with the idea that if each of the top, left, bottom, right coordinates are specified, the page/pane div will automatically fill the available viewport. Headers and footers work the same way by automatically stretching out to the viewport width and either being locked to the top or bottom.
This is a large departure from how ""pages"" and ""fixed"" headers work with jQM!
I will post the whole ASP.NET MVC project on my company GitHub page soon.

I haven't tested it myself thought. I will look carefully tomorrow and implement your fix in my own project.

",mesca,ToddThomson
4418,2012-05-31 21:02:27,"@mesca I tried to fix the jQM transition handler, but it was always 1 step forward then 1 step back. I ended up writing a cleaned-up version that is contained in scripts/acme/acme.transitions-1.1.js.
As I said above, I also imposed some changes to the css styles that a page uses - I've added a pane class to the ""page"". This is due to the limitations that jQM has with layouts ( I need to have multi-pane layouts for tablet versions of apps ).
Panes are absolutely positioned divs which take advantage of the browsers ( all browsers except ie6 ) ability to dynamically fill their containing box if all 4 of the top,left, bottom, right properties are set. This also makes fixed headers and fixed footers extremely easy to setup.
Anyway, if you are unfamiliar with the MVC 3 project structure that I used, please do not hesitate to contact me via my email address ( see my github profile for the email address ).

What I did:
1. include the acme.transitions-1.1.js
2. include the CSS for the pane rules
3. bind slide transitions (`$.mobile.transitionHandlers[""slide""] = acme.transitions.slide;`)

Do I need extra HTML?

Although everything works well with your demo project, I still have two bugs I have to figure out on my side (I use the M project framework with mobiscroll):
1. When transitioning from a scrolled page, the target page first appears with a scroll offset and is then repositioned
2. Other transitions stopped working

From my point of view, it seems to be a conflict with mobiscroll, I will investigate on this.

In order for this to work with the jQM transition handler, I would need to add a function call to a new show() function. The function would need to set a flag isPaneOffscreen accordingly.
I was hoping to get some input from the jQM team on the page/pane changes before going ahead and fixing up the jQM transition code - I guess they're busy with other tasks.

4418,2012-06-01 22:13:44,"@mesca I think that I've come to a conclusion on what to do with this issue. I'm going to:
- patch jQM to fix issue 4387
- patch jQM fo fix issue 4424
- stop using jQM fixed toolbars ( as they are the cause of the padding issue that is most relevant to my app + another 2 issues )
- utilize my pane.css to have fixed layout toolbars (headers & footers) and content ( I like having the scrollbars only on the content div )
- utilize Acme slide transition - it works!
- patch jQM transition handler to coexist with Acme transition handler ( deal with isPaneOffScreen )

Notes:
- This solution is NOT compatible with jQM fixed toolbars.

Thanks for the info! I know it looks strange but it is used to hide a button but still keep its functionality. Background transparent and opacity 0 didn't work for some reason so I suppose that's why we want to use the lowest possible opacity.

Maybe it is all just a mistake and has the value for IE's filter alpha opacity been copied from that opacity property. Not sure why that is set to .1 at one place and .0001 at another. Digging into it!
",jaspermdegroot,Alexn
4413,2012-06-19 15:00:47,"@Alexn 

I have been looking into this.

About class ui-btn-hidden: We add this class to the native button element which should be a fully transparent layar above the JQM styled button, so we keep its functionally but it is invisible.
Since it lost its functionally on some browsers when we used `background: transparent;` we switched to `opacity: 10;` and set the background-color to rgba(255,255,255,0).
Older IE browsers don't support rgba so we had to set the background-color to #FFF for those. With `filter: Alpha(Opacity=10);` you would see a semi white layar above all buttons on IE browsers. That's why we set it to `filter: Alpha(Opacity=.0001);`

On MSDN it says valid values are 0 to 100 so 0.0001 appears to be invalid. At the other hand, I didn't see IE throwing any errors/warnings and there are no issues with validation. The debug tool showed a value of 0 for the opacity so it looks like IE just rounds off.

I tested if it works with `filter: Alpha(Opacity=0);` as well and that seems to be the case. I haven't test this on Windows Phone though. I know there have been strange issues with WP Mango and opacity (see 01c77fa) so we have to be careful with changing things. We will test on WP and if it is not causing any problems we can change the value to 0.

I also checked if we need to add `-ms-filter:""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(opacity=.0001)"";` but this seems not necessary.

I think you misunderstood what this issue was about.
The code below is a simple representation of a page with fixed toolbars. Because ui-header and ui-footer have position fixed they are removed from the flow and ui-content goes underneath those elements. To prevent the top and bottom part of ui-content not being visible/accessible we set padding top and bottom on ui-page.
At first this is a default amount of padding and the updatePagePadding function sets the padding to the actual height of ui-header and ui-footer on certain events.

Sorry I should have been clearer about the question. I guess it's just hard to be sure of the reasons one might add an active state to a navbar in a page, but I think one use case could be if they scripted client-side tabs into a page. In that case, the initial state is only there to represent the active tab, and if the tab is changed, the active state should swap- and persist - to match the new active tab.

FWIW, I'm very much in agreement that the docs should be clearer about the availability in this class for navbars - not just those in persistent toolbars. But beyond that, I'm unsure how aggressive we should get with making the theme class itself sticky.

I tried your example with ie, safari, and chrome... still the same issue for me. In fact I lose the spinner after I click ok. I see you're trying to display the loading message in pageinit... for me this is too early in the page loading process. I believe that jqm hides the loader just before the pagebeforeshow event. 

Basically, what I'm trying to do is make an ajax call in place of the alert. The ajax call checks to see if the user is logged in and executes some controller-like functionality. While this is happening, I want to display the loading message to the user.
",bmurmistro,MauriceG
4390,2012-05-22 20:38:49,"@bmurmistro 

An alert message is not a good method for testing this, because an alert stops (some) browsers from loading/rendering until it is closed. I don't think that is jQuery Mobile related.

This example http://jsbin.com/ejilen/2/ reflects your actual use case and is working as expected. Please note that the loader will be moved to a widget in 1.2 like Anne already mentioned.

Also the problem with the fixed header toolbar positioning is still there.
The cause for the flash of content being displayed for both the to and from page is obvious in the code. The 'to' page is set to active (display: block) and then a scrollPage() takes place. So, for the duration of the scroll, the content of both pages occupy the viewport.

The ui-page-pre-in class sets the opacity of the to page to 0. This solution hides the to page while the scrollPage() processing is happening ( the root cause of the problem ).

The main purpose of mobile web design is to present content without the need to (zoom and) scroll horizontal. That's also why the use of tables is not recommended. I don't know what kind of data you want to display in the table, but I would strongly suggest to look into another approach.

That being said, when you set the overflow property to auto for that div you should be able to scroll horizontal. Since many mobile browsers don't support overflow (or not in a correct way) you might be interested in this: http://filamentgroup.com/lab/overthrow/

If I understand you right you use version 1.1.0 - the latest stable release.

For platforms that lack 3D support like Android 2.3.x all page transition fall back to 'fade', because all other transitions (including 'slide') result in a poor performance. So there is no method to make it fallback to 'slide' because that wouldn't make sense. The only option is setting the fallback to 'none'.

In other words, this prevents that 64% of the Android users are confronted with a website with bad performing animations.

[Update:]
I have to correct myself. I have been told that the option to define the default fallback can be 'abused' to override the default behaviour, although this is not recommended. Like so:



You have to bind this to the mobileinit event. See http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html

Transitions use CSS Keyframes and only work with browsers that support this.

JQM 1.0 + 1.0.1 - Only webkit browsers
JQM 1.1 + Latest - Webkit and Firefox browsers (Moz prefix added since FF started to support keyframes)

This is why it doesn't work on Opera and IE7 at all, and Firefox with version 1.0.1.

The idea is that not only static list items get that class, but all buttons. So for clickable buttons it would be an extra class which would also be very useful for making the active/focus state themable. 

At first I thought we had to duplicate background, but that isn't necessary. Same goes for border, color, etc..
We could move all properties except background-image from ui-btn-up-a to ui-btn-a. Hover and down state rules can stay the same.

That is a good solution and even easier to accomplish (change 1 word in JS and at that rule). The reason I came up with that extra class is that I already had it in mind for making the active state themable.
We can look into that later so I say +1 for your solution.

4340,2012-05-31 13:46:15,"Hey everyone. 

So, I did a little digging through commits to provide a little context into this line. It was added during the early releases to clean up a trail of focus/hover states that we were seeing while navigating jQM apps. Basically, focusing/tapping on another button on the page wasn't effectively blurring a button previously in focus, so button states were getting out of line.

While working on the problem, I'm fairly sure we tried manually triggering focus() on the clicked link (as @dcarrith kindly suggested above), but it still wasn't effectively blurring (or perhaps more specifically, triggering `mouseout` on) the other buttons on the page. This would be worth re-testing. I think the problem was most commonly seen in iOS, but it may have been on Android browsers as well.

Here's the commit
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/823485ce11ebb28dadf2b3b51f23f305ba0b314b

In hindsight, the change was overly-agressive, and the performance findings above verify that. Really, we just needed to find only the buttons in the active page that have stale states and remove their classes.

With our theme framework, this is a little trickier than it sounds. States are tied to letter-based themes, so the hover and focus state classes are variable. The blur and vmouseup handlers bound to these buttons keep track of that button's theme classes, so triggering blur on them was at least a clean way to clean things up. In the end, using the event triggers still might be the best approach; that said, I think we can remove the performance problem by minimizing the number of buttons that we're blurring by using a smarter selector (looking for class attributes that contain values with those prefixes).

Looking at the [buttonMarkup plugin](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/823485ce11ebb28dadf2b3b51f23f305ba0b314b), the blur event removes the following classes from a button: `ui-btn-hover-[theme]`, `ui-btn-down-[theme]`, and `ui-focus`. 

So those are the classes we'll need for our lookup. Something like the following might work...



In a brief console test, that seems to winnow it down to just what we need.

Anyone have time to give that some analysis?
",scottjehl,dcarrith
4340,2012-06-01 16:07:54,"I guess the question for @scottjehl is if there are .ui-btn elements that are not links that can be focused/active. Also, firing the event handlers directly won't work if any of the btns use delegated handlers.

I did a quick profile without scott's proposed change on an iPad 3 running iOS 5.1:

http://goo.gl/kPIQ7

and with scott's change:

http://goo.gl/hSpJa

The old selector took 5ms to execute, the new one takes 10ms, but the overall blur call went from 5070ms down to 167ms which is a big improvement ... but, 177ms is still pretty slow in my opinion, especially on an iPad3, considering that this time doesn't include the actual loading/change of page.

4340,2012-06-21 23:32:35,"Alight @scottjehl figured out the root of the issue here. In 1.0, we first scrolled to the top of the page before starting a transition. In 1.1, we wanted to avoid this jump so we now fade the page out first by default. As it turns out, devices like an iPhone seem to keep the page above your scroll position in memory when doing a transition, but not the part of the page below.

So if you're on a long, complex page like the listview performance page with 500 items, clicking the first list item will work pretty well, but one halfway down will be very slow and a bottom one will crash the browser. Why? Because the browser is trying to animate a really massively tall page when scrolled down due to how it handle things. Test here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-performance.html

As a test, we added another condition to say that if you're either coming or going to a page where the scroll position is 3x the height of the device's screen, skip the transition. This makes the navigation back to it's snappy self. You'll notice we're using scroll position, not screen height here because I can navigate to a 10,000 pixel tall page fine but if I need to navigate away from that same page when scrolled down (or nav back to this with a scroll position restored), it will need way more memory to run the transition and could be slow or fail.

This 3x value is just a starting point, we can use whatever criteria we want. Here is the change to line 28 in jquery.mobile.transition.js to give this a spin:

`none = !$.support.cssTransitions || maxTransitionOverride || !name || name === ""none"" || Math.max( $( window ).scrollTop(), toScroll ) > screenHeight * 3,`

The question is how to layer this in. Do we just pick a value for this for 1.1.1 as a safely valve for performance now, then expose a config option for 1.2 to set the criteria? This is parallel to `maxTransitionOverride` - this sets the screen width that shuts off transitions automatically, this new one is like ```maxTransitionScrollOverride''' where we nix transitions based on vertical scroll position. Naming could be cleaned up to make this clearer.

@gseguin or @johnbender - do you want to give this a look and think about how we should get this in?

Why? Because the browser is trying to animate a really massively tall page when scrolled down due to how it handle things. Test here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-performance.html

As a test, we added another condition to say that if you're either coming or going to a page where the scroll position is 3x the height of the device's screen, skip the transition. This makes the navigation back to it's snappy self. You'll notice we're using scroll position, not screen height here because I can navigate to a 10,000 pixel tall page fine but if I need to navigate away from that same page when scrolled down (or nav back to this with a scroll position restored), it will need way more memory to run the transition and could be slow or fail.

This 3x value is just a starting point, we can use whatever criteria we want. Here is the change to line 28 in jquery.mobile.transition.js to give this a spin:

`none = !$.support.cssTransitions || maxTransitionOverride || !name || name === ""none"" || Math.max( $( window ).scrollTop(), toScroll ) > screenHeight * 3,`

The question is how to layer this in. Do we just pick a value for this for 1.1.1 as a safely valve for performance now, then expose a config option for 1.2 to set the criteria? This is parallel to `maxTransitionOverride` - this sets the screen width that shuts off transitions automatically, this new one is like ```maxTransitionScrollOverride''' where we nix transitions based on vertical scroll position. Naming could be cleaned up to make this clearer.

@gseguin or @johnbender - do you want to give this a look and think about how we should get this in?

Before i create the PR can you give feedback on this:

(on page ""Anatomy of a Page"" new paragraph right below the one starting with ""PLEASE NOTE"" at the bottom of the page)

The id attributes of elements need to be not only unique on a given page, but also unique across the pages in a site. This is because jQuery Mobile's single-page navigation model allows many different ""pages"" to be present in the DOM at the same time. This also applies when using a multi-page template, since all ""pages"" on the template are loaded at once.

Thanks!

Jasper

Note: The docs are a bit inconsistent when it comes to using lowercase or uppercase for ""id"". What do you prefer?

Opera mini, as well as some other browsers, won't dispatch a mouse event for a given element unless it actually has an event listener for that event on it. Without that dummy listener mouse events weren't happening at all.

I'm not sure why it breaks iOS ... I guess the question is if you click and hold on an event with legitimate handler on it, does it behave the same?

I have objections :-)
First off, I think the chances of using jqmobile inside node.js are very slim and the advantage of strict mode (potentially higher performance and a vastly improved error detection rate) doesn't make it worthwhile to support node.js without an actual use case.
Here's my killer argument: jQuery itself (see https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/outro.js) uses `window` - so there is a dependency anyway. And there really is no way to use it in node.js - `window` is mainly used for event handling on the dom and size- and orientation handling of the viewport. IMHO it's not overly realistic to use jqm in another context, as that would have to be preceded by massive rewrites. You really wouldn't use node's `this` for jqm. And you shouldn't. The required monkeypatching would be a mess.
And you don't really know beforehand if any other context you would use it in even supports the API you require for `this`.

After changing the theme and hover the button, the initial theme is applied again and no theme change is possible anymore. I stuck on this when building the fiddle above and lose it out of sight somehow. http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/RgCF8/5/ for a quick click demo ...
A look into a web inspector tool shows, after the theme is changed, the input surrounding div keeps the initial theme. The ui-btn-hover and ui-btn-up classes are not applied correct anymore.

",MauriceG,agcolom
4317,2012-05-13 18:54:50,"Hi @rskokan !
Because you do not set any theme on any container (page or content), the default theme is **c**.
The Buttons inherit that c-theme so they are white on startup.
When changing the theme to **a**, the buttons have to be **black**. 
The workaround raises an error: _cannot call methods on button prior to initialization_ and the hover ""animation"" is lost.
This may because you call refresh on the surrounding div, not the button input itself.
May we find a solution before @Wilto will open our eyes again ;-)

I can confirm the issue: On Opera Mini when a text input has an initial value this disappears on focus. The cause is an Opera Mini bug, which is triggered by jQuery Mobile binding handlers to the focus event.

Thanks for reviewing this PR!

I just checked the JS again and it seems to me that the framework only add the ui-link-inherit class in the listview widget. Also, it always concerns a link wrapped in .ui-btn (which gets the ui-focus box-shadow styling on focus).
Can you give me an example when a child link in a bar has ui-link-inherit?

If we move it to the specific CSS files, we should move the rule for .ui-btn:focus to the button.css as well. Removing it from the theme to structure CSS makes it harder for people to adjust the focus style to their own preferences.

Ajax call (and I'm still experimenting with the CSS3 effects and overall settings):



 I want to set data-native-menu depending on _support.touch_, so I can't just write it into the markup.

Should also work and would save a chunk of code.

So to your question. I'm rendering after the data has arrived. Not sure what's better - sending a big chunk of enhanced data or processing it on the device. For now, I'm sending pre-enhanced markup.

While I agree that there's an issue to fix here, I'm not sure we should disable auto-initialization of button and input elements to fix it. Am I right in thinking that's what this change does? Auto-init'ing `button` elements into button widgets (without requiring `data-role=button` is similar to auto-init`ing`select`, text inputs, and others - it's an expected behavior of the framework. @toddparker do you agree?

To ensure buttons within toolbars default to mini (while still allowing them to be overridden with `data-mini=false`, it seems like we could adjust the logic in the mini default value. 

Changing line 27 of buttonMarkup.js to the following does the job, but it's ugly and not very readable. Perhaps you'd have time to tinker? I used a closure within the ternary to avoid calling jqmData() twice, but still, there's surely a better way.

Instead of having an option to add a close button (and define the close button text for accessibility), we'd just ask people to add in some markup inside their popups for the close button so they can have complete control over the content and styling without adding too much complexity to the API. We can add some classes to make it easy to position it say left or right in the top as a sensible default but these classes can be tweaked as needed by people.

My initial comment is incomplete/incorrect because is does not always look bad but it can look bad. It mostly depends on which colors and size are used, but indeed also the platform.
I just found out on the H5BP site that when you set text-shadow to none, you must also declare color and background. Obviously I should have spend a little more time on this PR (sorry) and I am going to close it now. When we look at making the active/focus state themable we could consider including styling for ::selection.

Since you asked I'm happy to help you get started! Here's what I can think of off the top of my head:
1. You'll need apache + php setup to run the docs and the tests
2. `test/unit/fixedToolbar` is where you'll find the testing files relevant to this pull request. Specifically `fixedToolbar.js` and `index.html`
3. `fixedToolbar.js` has all the fixed toolbar tests (not too many as yet).
4. I don't think this will require an async test since you can just run `updatePadding` manually by getting the fixed toolbar element.

If you get totally lost, want feedback along the way, or just don't feel like putting in the effort that's fine just post back here. Thanks for your interest!

I understand the issue is described by https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4259 because the emails you receive and send about this are in fact comments added to the thread there :-)

We hoped your issue would be fixed by PR 4260, but - as you noticed - that is not the case. That PR fixed issues with the ""updatePagePadding"" function and after I looked into your issue again I concluded it is not related to that function.

Position fixed means fixed to the viewport. The address bar is part of the window, but not the viewport. See also section 4 here http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#technotes/tn2010/tn2262/_index.html
That is why ""the fixed toolbar will rise by the amount of the addressbar"" sounds like the position of the fixed header is not updated when the viewport changes.

Looking forward to your test page so we are sure that we are looking at the exact same use case!

4253,2012-05-03 19:59:44,"@jblas - got it. To navigate with page parameters, doing this on pagebeforechange is all I need:



This keeps a single page in the DOM, updates the URL correctly (and Coldfusion does not moan about two url.types in page.cfm?type=old#page.cfm?type=new... pheew...). I'm not sure if I need the _allowSamePageTransition_, but I want to sit back now and watch it work a couple of times, before re-fiddling.

Quick side note: 
In your first link [JQM docs](http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html) (first link above), I'm supposed to block the original event on pagebeforechange first, then config options, then fire a new changePage. 

Besides this being really easy to loop my browser into oblivion, it can be done without preventDefaulting and firing a new changepage, too. Just let the original event run through with modified options. This works so much better. Less event-baggage, you always have the options from the original event available (_fromPage_ being my favorite MIA in multiview) and I'm not starting with urlHistory and changehash. 

I've been sitting on this for a while doing panel-navigation on pagebeforechange and found it working much better if you just ""kick"" the original changepage in the right direction vs. firing a new changepage. If you use the 300ms vclick ""headstart"" to grab/temp-store the click event-target & data, you can also manage click-transitions and programmatic changepage calls through a single function. 

I'm helped, so closing this. Thanks!

Follow up question: 
The refetched page will have _data-external-page_ set to true. Do you know of an easy way to make the refetched page behave like the actual first (anchor) page in the DOM? 

Say I'm starting at page1.html and then change the language to page1.html?lang=DE. page1.html should still be the anchor page, which it was before.

In the same file on line 38 the closing tag is &lt;/submit&gt; instead of &lt;/button&gt;. I could create another PR for this but since I know you also suggested a complete makeover for this page (#4256) I thought a 3rd request would be too much :-) Maybe you can push a second commit to this PR?

Note: The wrong closing tag would remain after your suggestion (hopefully) has been merged into master. See line 72.

4243,2012-05-16 22:18:27,"@toddparker  I don't think the pagination as I understand the implementation doesn't really work for my use case.  I have a starting page that links to a list page that then contains many links to additional detail pages.  I have a left-to-right swipe event handler configured on the detail pages to navigate back to the list page and another left-to-right swipe handler configured on the list page to return back to the starting page.  My main issue with the pagination plugin is I don't want all the linked pages on my list page pre-fetched because there could be a lot of pages on the list page and the user is likely only going to view one or two of the detail pages.  Unless I've misunderstood the implementation of the pagination plugin that is...
",begmandev,toddparker
4243,2012-05-18 18:21:52,"@begmandev - the pagination plugin is really simple: on each page you hard-code forward and back links in the markup and the plugin styles these as arrows, adds the swipe gestures and pre-caches these pages so they are ready. Seems to me that you can just set the URLs of these links as needed to achieve your goals, but it's up to you to decide if it's right for your needs.
",toddparker,begmandev
4243,2012-05-18 19:29:28,"@toddparker - Thanks for the response, I appreciate it.  I do understand the purpose and usage of the pagination plugin but I really don't want pages to be pre-fetched and cached for my use case.  In addition, if I have to add a bunch of logic to fiddle with the element links to prevent pre-fetching/caching that seems to kind of defeat the purpose of using the pagination plugin in the first case.  I guess I'll look at it again but to the original issue are you saying that the only way to enable page-level swipe events on a page that has a slider would be to use the pagination plugin?  Perhaps I'm just misunderstanding your suggestion.

Is there no other easier way to prevent slide events on a slider element from propagating any higher up the DOM as a swipe event?  It seems on the surface that it would be more appropriate for slider move events to not be propagated at all beyond the slider element itself.  But I obviously don't have the in-depth knowledge of the framework as the JQM team to say whether that would be a good or bad thing.

The documentation dosent say it will remove it that is part of changepage.

This would mean that when a page is shown using a transition there is no padding, but when the user refreshes the page or enters the site on that page, there will be padding.

4206,2012-05-01 17:29:13,"Ok, I see what's going on. Your page contains nothing but script tags in the body. When jQuery Mobile initializes, it notices that the body contains no data-role=""page"" divs in it so it wraps the entire contents of the body within a page div. Now jQuery Mobile is using jQuery's wrapAll() method to do this, apparently part of that implementation looks for any script tags inside the content being wrapped, and it then loads each script source via XHR ... so the browser ends up loading the scripts twice, confusing the debugger.

That is correct. The buttons in the navbar are styled like buttons and the header and footer are styled like bars. So if you want your navbar buttons in the footer to have the same style as that footer you just create a swatch/theme where you give both buttons and bars the same colors. See also 'Theming navbars' here http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/docs-navbar.html

1) @MauriceG in your jsFiddle it says that, absent a theme, swatch c is the default for the page.  Can you point me to where that behavior is documented?  That seems really important, but it was news to me.  I had assumed that the default would be ""a"" everywhere.  There's probably a great doc page that I'm missing.

2) @uGoMobi yes, what you're saying does correct my understanding of how things work. I guess I had assumed that if the footer is black (per theme a) and the only thing in the footer was a navbar (which I'd assume is super common, since it looks the most like the default iphone navbar) then the navbar would be black as well.  But, I'll create another swatch with black buttons to handle this scenario.

as far as I can see the animations in jqm 1.3.1 for the flip switch directly modifies the `left` and `width` property of elements. This causes a lot of layouts, which is slow. The solution would be to use css animations / transitions when available or don't execute the animations when the browser does not support css animations / transitions, just like the page transitions degrade if needed.

Great ideas all around. I think adding a full set of icons to the section on theming will add soem nice emphasis (http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-themes.html) and adding a link to this from the basics page as @agcolom suggests is also a good idea. Tweaking the language on the 3 buttons on the basics page to say ""custom icons"" or ""16x16 icons"" vs. ""standard icons"" will help distinguish these. I think that's the only place where there would be confusion between these types of icons but if you all see another place where this is confusing, let's use consistent language.

One of the things I was thinking about with regards to this (I like the icons) is that the file size for the font face is crazy huge when considering how many icons a given application is going to make use of.



Is there some way around this otherwise I don't see how we could include something like this in the library. Honestly I don't see how anyone serving a application to bandwidth starved mobile devices could use something like this for a couple icons :(

This will be low priority since we don't officially support this method of loading jqm. I believe what we've done in the past is to create a meta module where jquery is the initial load dependency, your init methods are in a callback with require of the rest of jqm. Something like:

My app doesn't use scrolling directly on pages, I just have ""-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch"" on content boxes within the pages. To stop any scrolling problems JQM might cause, I have this code added ""window.scrollTo = function(){};""

I will give the scrolling a look in a bit with some simple test cases, not my app, to see if I can help you.

4129,2012-04-22 04:25:30,"@dcarrith I took a look and though it is very nice, I feel that the long scrolls are not user-friendly at all. The optimal solution would be to have the page scrolled before the user even sees it, would you not agree? With this in mind, I set up a page on my server to figure this issue out and came up with a temporary fix. Maybe with your help, we can come up with a real patch.

Test case is here: http://scrollto.com/test.html

There are 2 pages which look like documentation pages, try any transition and then use the back/forward button of your browser to see the scrolling in action. You shouldn't actually see any scrolling because it happens before the page transition.

This is the code for the fix:



In my past experiences with building web apps, changing height of elements will not allow the browser to immediately scroll to that height. To circumvent this, I have overridden the scrollTo calls to first adjust the body height THEN scroll on the next frame of JS execution, after CSS changes have taken effect. Without the timeout, the scrollTo will be effectiveless.

I see this comment in the jQuery Mobile Code:   



Seems like the devs have it a bit wrong, it's not the 3D transformation blocking the scrollTo. It's that most browsers, webkit namely, are not allowing a scrollTo immediately after height change, setTimeout(func, 0) needs to be used to get around this limitation.

4129,2012-04-22 06:27:43,"@dcarrith I've had the domain for a while, yeah :)

I totally agree, transparent > smooth > jumpy

Just made some changes to test.html to make it easier to see the difference between page1 and page2. 

For me, the scrolling is working fine, however there is a problem with some of the transitions flickering (youll see blue/red)

Maybe you are confusing the animation flickering with the scroll jumping, I believe it's fixed at the test.html page I've linked.

If not, what environment are you using to test? I'm using Chrome.

The issue with this solution which is similar to ones that we've discussed internally is that there are likely people who expect the `pagebeforechange` to be fired with the actual page DOM element loaded after the ajax request. We probably need to continue to fire it twice, deprecate the second firing (with the DOM element), and add a new event.

I'm going to close this one, but you've got the right idea. If you want to join the dev meetings and discuss on Thursdays we start at 11am PST.

4106,2012-04-18 16:14:56,"@deAtog 

I think switching back to the timeout doesn't solve the problem that the patch you reverted addressed. That is the original implementation assumes the `hashchange` generated by the same history event that generates the `popstate` will happen before the popstate. In the case of the original setup it waited up to 100ms to swallow that hashchange event by disabling hashchange handling. Your change.

What browsers did you test this on?
",johnbender,deAtog
4106,2012-04-18 17:46:45,"@deAtog 

We're fully aware that the hashchange even gets fired along with popstate. In fact, the reason for the original 100ms is that the amount of time between the url change and the hashchange event firing along with a popstate is variable based on the browser. The previous assumption was the hashchange would always run before that 100ms timer had fired thereby allowing `self.nextHashChangePrevented( true );` to swallow the hashchange. 

Unfortunately it didn't always behave that way and that meant the hashchange handling would, sometimes, be enabled and run _after_ the timeout took care of the popstate resulting in two navigation events being handled by jqm. Reducing that number to 0 means it's even more likely to happen.

The patch you reverted was meant to handle these situations by determining if a hashchange event would be firing because the popped url had a different hash and taking the necessary steps to handle it from there. I'd like to try and address the issue with the current implementation so that we can avoid the black magic of finding just the right timeout so that the transition is both fast and stable.

4106,2012-04-18 23:45:13,"@deAtog 

I went back to play around and I think I see what you were getting at in IRC. I'm going to noodle on this a bit but we may have no choice but to use a timeout since there isn't a way to differentiate the browsers that do an don't throw the hashchange on popstate. 

I'll post back when I've had a chance to think about it.

Alright, I've reverted to using the timeout but this time I don't delay the navigation event I only delay the re-enabling of the navigation hashchange handling. At least here the timeout won't affect user interaction when popstate is enabled where as before it was delaying the transition by the timeout value.

I looked into the first problem, too. Here is a [sample page](http://franckreich.de/jqm/sample.html).

This is what's happening, if you have a link like this:


- Inside _resetUIkeys_ function JQM is adding the _#-hashtag_ to dialogs and subkeys. Ok.
- But if a href like above is passed, the function receives _pagetwo_, doesn't add the hashtag and returns _pagetwo_
- In _hashValueAfterReset_,  _$.mobile.path.parseUrl( pagetwo )_ populates object falsely because of missing _#_
- _$.mobile.path.parseUrl( pagetwo )_.**hash** will be an empty string passed back as _toHash_ and _fromHash_
- Inside _onPopState_, _toHash_ and _fromHash_ always equal (both empty strings)
- Thus **hashChanged** is comparing two empty strings and always returns true(?) - I'm confused as to why...

I have consoled this into the sample page. Goto page 2 > Goto page 3 > go back and check the console.

I guess to solve _resetUIkeys_ would have to add a #-hashtag to links like ""pagetwo"" as well.

No label means no button. That is not a bug. Using a label is not only required by JQM like the documentation says, but not using it is bad practise in general.

If you include the same checkbox form on multiple pages you could use php's random function to create unique ID's. Something like $myid = 'chkbox-' . rand(0,10000); and then echo $myid as value of both 'for' and 'id'.

The trouble with jQM's approach, in terms of my current project, is that the web app I'm working on needs to provide the latest up-to-date info on nearly every page. Because of this, the Cache-Control header of almost every page prevents caching. The way jQM retains the initial page circumvents this. I could disable the framework's Ajax features, but I'd hate to lose the smooth and speedy page changes and start getting form post resubmission warnings on page refresh again.

What puzzles me is that I had a functioning work-around for this before upgrading the project from 1.0.1 to 1.1 final. I was using the following code to ensure removal of every page from the DOM, including any subpages added with the subpage plugin. Now, this code gives me a blank page when I use the back button to return to the initial page. If anyone can tell me why it stopped working and suggest how to fix it, jQM's retention of the initial page in the DOM would stop being a problem for me.

@toddparker Could it be you missed that I was talking about multiple selects, not custom select menus in general?

The multiple select menu can be opened with enter, but arrow keys only scroll the window. The issue is that the menu (modal or dialog) does not get focus when opened. Focus is still on the button.

The issue with tab goes for all type of custom select menus (modal or dialog).
If you hit tab (by accident or because you think it can be used to walk true option list) you can't get the focus back on the option list and the up/down arrow key get their scrolling functionality. If there is a close/back button in the header you can 'tab' to it and close the menu.
Biggest problem is when the menu doesn't have a close button. In that case there is no way to close the menu anymore with keyboard after the tab key has been pressed.
The behaviour of the tab key is expected because it skips to next link and the options in the list are not links. Maybe it is possible to realize that the up/down arrow key bring back focus to the option list. In general I think it would be a good idea when the escape key gets a 'close menu' functionality.

Scott's fixes from this morning seem to have made a big difference. For a quick and dirty simulation of an embedded web view, similar to  PhoneGap (same rendering deal, minus phone gap.js), go to the config test page below, save it to your home screen in iOS, then open it and browse the docs.

4024,2012-05-02 09:30:41,"I tried the files @tegansnyder mentioned above... its still the same... the flicker looks toned down but there's still this broken page jump experience when moving between pages that have lots of content.

Usecase: Page 1 has 30 items in list view... scroll down so you're in the middle of the page, now click on any link to another page and see how badly the page flickers + jumps + looks soo broken :(

Persistant header/footers also didn't solve this...

",3drockz,toddparker
4024,2012-05-03 22:14:27,"@dcarrith I agree... the fixed header/footers are one of the biggest issues.

I also figured that the major jump is caused when you've scrolled to the middle of a page and trigger a transition and figured that the jump is caused when JQM tries to scroll top and trigger the transition. So I explicitly set it in jQuery to auto scroll to top on every link click. 

This fixes 99% of the issue and you no more see the page jumping (the 1% is just a minor flicker in the sticky header which I'm still trying to figure out).

$('a').click(function () {
    $('html, body, .ui-page').animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, 0);
});

This works best either when data-transition is set to either none or fade. Hope this helps someone with this issue.

I'm still curious on the 1% on why the headers kinda still flicker when the page loads... this happens on every page load (but this wont happen when you have a multi-page template in the same HTML)

When you look at the app in the phone, its so easy for someone to look at your app's flicker/transition behavior and say it is Cordova/HTML5!

I wanted to update given that I've tried this on multiple devices implementing multiple fixes from above. I've turned off all animations, which improves performance and eliminates the stutter.

I did however find the issue for Android 4 re: flickering, which was not in fact jquery mobile at all. We were using hardware acceleration in our AndroidManifest.xml. 

If anyone else has this problem, simply remove: **android:hardwareAccelerated=""true""** from the activity in question. Also some may have problems with the various css tweaks across different versions of Android when using -webkit-backface-visibility and -webkit-translate3d/X/Y/Z properties. Hope this helps.

Before considering adding a new container, did we confirm that `body { width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; }` doesn't fix this in a similar way?

If so...

Are we proposing here that the framework should add another container, dynamically, as a child of the `body` all the time? Or should it only do so in phonegap/offline scenarios? Or should we recommend that people building for android in phonegap follow the steps outlined in the article above?

I'm concerned that wrapping our pages in a generated container goes in the opposite direction we are currently headed, in that it imposes another JS manipulation step to the entire dom before the page can be shown, properly styled. But we also don't want to add static boilerplate markup to our requirements, as the example showed.

Did we consider the possibility of offering an optional plugin for phonegap scenarios that will generate this wrapper div and set the `$.mobile.pageContainer` to reference it, but not do this by default all the time?

Ok, I got it! Make sure your meta viewport tag matches the following regex:

Fixed it. 

In short: 
- I'm setting fallback _position:absolute_ to fixed-headers inside panels in ""fixed-hidden-state"" vs. JQM using pos:rel  
- Headers with pos:abs cause content section to jump up to css-top:0 on blacklisted browsers  
- Setting padding-top=header.outerHeight postions content correctly, but overthrow scrolls above padded region  
- Instead setting margin-top=header.outerHeight positions content correctly and overthrow works as expected  

Actually makes sense...

<p>I'm not sure I like your fix. The 1.0 code attempted to squash the hashchange event that might occur at the time of the popstate event. The 1.1 code attempted to prevent the hashchange event in cases where no hashchange was expected, but allowed it to occur otherwise. Your code simply assumes a hashchange event is going to occur, and cancels the second event should it occur within a particular time frame. After a lot of thought, I've come up with the following ideas on how to solve this once and for all:</p>


<ol>
<li>Implement two different page tracking systems:
<ol>
    <li>stateTracking
        <ul>
             <li>uses history.pushState and the window.popstate event for tracking pages</li>
             <li>produces pretty urls, and includes an option not to make any url changes</li>
             <li>does not make use of the hashchange event</li>
             <li>if pageState isn't supported, simply fall back to the hashTracking method</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>hashTracking
         <ul>
             <li>heavily reliant upon the hashchange event</li>
             <li>same basic implementation that occurs when pageStateEnabled is currently set to false</li>
         </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

</li>
<li>Try to fix existing method via a new virtual hashchange event, vhashchange. A single handler for the current hashchange event would be implemented which would ignore any browser issued hashchange events that shouldn't have occurred. I've played around with this a bit, but have yet to make it work properly. Existing code could simply bind to the vhashchange event rather than the hashchange event.
</li>
</ol>

<p>Of these options, I think the first is well worth pursing. Not only would it solve the issue, but it will also make page changes happen quicker and more seamlessly. IE, when using 1.1 with pageState enabled in Firefox, the jump in the address bar due to changing the hash and then replacing the state is very noticeable. This option would eliminate that initial hash change and result in a much smoother page transition. As far as backwards compatibility is concerned, none of the current api would change. $.mobile.pageStateEnabled could still be used to force the use of hashTracking over stateTracking. Internally however, there are a lot of areas that will need to be changed to make this happen.</p>

1. The 1.0 solution also assumed a hashchange, which was the reason for the delay. In either case if it doesn't occur it doesn't matter. 
2. Until we drop support iOS 4.x we have to use `replaceState`. `pushState` simply did not work in mobile safari for that version of iOS, making it a non-starter. This means that we have to create a new history state for each navigation event and then replace it. 
3. We cannot support a system that doesn't track page state in the url in some fashion. Using the hash is bad enough because of the way it breaks the linking architecture of the web, which is why we continue to support `replaceState` in spite of it being broken nearly everywhere.
4. It seems like any `vhashchange` solution would look strikingly similar to the code to swallow the hashchange events that we have now.

Either way we'll take this into consideration when we address the nav model for a bit of a refactor (on the books for the future).

Sorry for the confusion. My comment was more a note to other team members.

When looking at other issues with fixed toolbars we noticed this re-order of header and content. I am not saying that this is what causes the ""not resizing"" issue, but it could mean there is a relation with other issues. Just something we have to look into.

With ""latest"" I refer to the code as it is right now, not latest/current stable release (1.1.0 at the moment). This is what should be used for test pages because maybe an issue has been fixed already or changes have been made that affect the issue.

It would be very helpful if you could provide a simple test page that reproduces the issue, using our JSBin template that loads latest code. You can find it here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile#issues

Another point is the data-rel=""dialog"" on the link back to page 2 (which is actually page 1, the first page loaded). That page is first loaded as regular page and remains in the DOM. If you then link back to it with data-rel=""dialog"" it will cause issues. I removed this from the link.

Then still an issue remains with the fill of the slider. This seems to be a bug. The fill is created by adding the ui-btn-active class. The framework removes that class on pagehide. That is only supposed to be done with buttons, so we have to create an exception for the slider.

3880,2012-03-27 15:55:40,"@scottjehl, sorry I got side tracked. In the code that discovered this bug I was actually testing if the dom node had fixed toolbar by testing its data and the test was returning true. I switched to test if the ui-fixed-header class.

I was also under the impression that the destroy method would remove the widget from the dom node's data. 
",gseguin,scottjehl
3880,2012-04-03 11:29:41,"hey @gseguin 

Interesting, I just tested and found that this problem does not occur in jQuery UI widgets. This means either our widget factory version is missing the required fix, or our extension of the widget factory is messing things up.

In fact, destroyed widgets in jQuery UI return undefined when you try and get the element's `$(selector).data(""widgetnamehere"")`, whereas for us, we get the full widget instance.

I'm thinking we're in need of an upgrade, but it's probably not wise to do so for 1.1. Do you agree?

Since this isn't just an issue with fixedtoolbars, but all our widgets, I'm not sure where it's affecting people, or where we'd even attempt to prevent it. If it's already affecting people, they'll probably need to adjust their code because the widget factory update will only bring them into an exception.

For example, currently the method applies in places it shouldn't, but after the upgrade, it'll probably throw the ""cannot call methods on xyz prior to initialization"" error.

The way around it would be to select the element by its widget class before doing anything with it:



So, should we close this out and add a generic ticket for upgrading our widget version?

3875,2012-04-03 17:45:39,"Hi @rsammons 

I took a look at your demo and fixed things up to be more inline with how we'd recommend doing this. 

Basically, when each page is created, the page plugin is going to auto-init any toolbars that page contains, so you don't need to call `fixedtoolbar()` on anything yourself. Instead, you can bind to `mobileinit` and set the global `tapToggle` option to `false`. 

Here's the head of your page with that in place:



Here's a demo showing that working: http://jsbin.com/ucuvip/10/

That said, I think what was going on before was that the toolbars in the second page were being initialized before their parent page, and as a result, you were seeing some unexpected results. I'll look into that further, but the above solution should get you what you need.

The issue with your jsbin is that it uses the `$.mobile.showPageLoadingMsg` as a value for `beforeSend`. As a result the second argument to `showPageLoadingMsg` is the ajax settings object from jQuery, per the docs http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/.

Altering the `beforeSend` value to be a callback in which `showPageLoadingMsg` is called explicitly is one possible solution.

Removing the heading from the toolbar appears to resolve the issues. I suppose then it's a question of whether we support both a navbar and a heading in the header.

Hmm, the difference between explicit support (""it's in the docs"") and implicit support (""it works"") makes a big difference wrt how fast we'll get to something like this or if we get to it at all. 

Until we decide if we want to support this you can add additional padding via the `.ui-page-header-fixed` class or add css to the viewport based on the header size with js with:



though you'll probably have to tweak that second selector to prevent it from capturing other headers.

Is the form `data-ajax=false`? I'm assuming that it's not given that the url is being manipulated.

If it's not the current implementation of the xhr object in browsers doesn't support redirects so neither can we. There has been some discussion of supporting the workaround of supporting a higher level 200 response (280?) but that's not likely to happen soon.

3803,2013-04-26 17:48:40,"This is really unfortunate behavior--the problem for me is not that it's occurring, per se, but that it propagates to other elements and there's no way to stop it because it's a completely different event trigger.  For instance, I'm using a swipeleft event to swipe a view, but when done over another UI element (a contact selection field in this case), the tap registers on the field as well as the swipe on the element below.  The only thing I can think to do is provide a virtual interface above it to allow/stop propagation to below elements, which is complicated and unnecessary.

@arschmitz waiting to determine if it's a taphold is no different than the way that touch determines tap vs. click.  If the touchstart and touchend events occur in less than the tap threshold, then you're not delaying the tap, nor disabling te taphold functionality.  In fact, the tap event isn't even fired until you let go and it triggers both the taphold and tap events, so I don't think the delay wouldn't be a problem.

I propose that swipe, swipeleft, swiperight, and taphold all do not trigger a tap when executed.  
",arcreative,arschmitz
3803,2013-05-08 12:28:42,"@arschmitz Actually there is a very simple fix, add a flag in the taphold handler and test if the flag is set to true before firing the tap event, reset the flag on each mousedown. This does not involve delaying anything as the flag is set to true only in the timeout handler for taphold (on a standard tap the flag will not have been set and the tap event will be triggered normally).

I think this is just an issue of documentation clarity:

If you define page explicitly in the second file (file2.html) you need to include the script tag inside the `data-role=page` div. If you don't define a page the body will be used as the page contents and will be wrapped with a `data-role=page` div so any scripts that are included in the body in that case will get executed.

I'll make some changes to the docs and close the issue with those commits. Please post back here if you have any questions.

3799,2012-03-13 16:04:35,"Sorry but I still have problem.
If I use external javascript file in file2.html (file2.js) the external
file is not loaded (in case it found in the head section).
If I move it to the body section it will work, but I can't move all the
external js to the body, because I'm using sitemesh as template for all
files in project, and the common external script should be in the head
section.

I upload sample where the script is in the head section, and the call for
the external js is within the data-role=""page"" div.
See: http://www.lotomania.co.il/file1.html you can see that it can't find
the external js when using ajax navigation system.

2. replace the index.html to the attached one (see attached source code);
3. run the application directly in Galaxy Nexus (it will be automatically deployed);
4. After see the page (portrait), change the orientation to landscape ( do not touch the screen).

First, thanks for the fiddle. It's rare and always appreciated.

In general we support this type of activity through refresh methods triggered through the plugin system:



The update layout is meant, I think, mostly for you to bind to to know when you should update custom widgets or components in the page. Not as a mechanism for telling our components to update. Though I can sympathize with the confusion.

To support this we'd have to add a refresh or collapse method to the widget and that's not likely to happen before 1.1 final. 

@gseguin @toddparker 

Feel free to weigh in here.
",johnbender,phillpafford
3771,2012-03-10 13:57:53,"@johnbender Thanks for the update but to my knowledge there is no refresh method on collapsible:

Scott's fixes from this morning seem to have made a big difference. For a quick and dirty simulation of an embedded web view, similar to PhoneGap (same rendering deal, minus phone gap.js), go to the config test page below, save it to your home screen in iOS, then open it and browse the docs.

If you test 1.1, in fullscreen mode, you'll see a flash even when just browsing normal pages with the fade transition. If you try the fixed header page, there is a nasty double blink:

On master, I just tried master after the fixes from this morning and it's waaay better. Both of thee flashes are gone. Awesome work by @scottjehl

This is sort of an accidental feature I guess in that we support icons for buttons but for non split list items the expectation is that the icon is defined on the list item. The branch that I pushed expects that the icon to be defined on the list item and not the link. Your feedback is welcome on that implementation.

Also, I'd like to double check that you built your markup as a consequence of the button docs and not the list docs. Which  makes sense, but we should clarify or support both options in the future.

That might work for you but the first example is the recommended way to construct the link. Pushstate support means on a refresh the new page will be loaded as `http://foo.com/subfolder/test2.html` and and the id reference would fail miserably.

Similar issue here. If you move the page content out from under the click that comes after the short delay you're going to see these issues every time. If you change the code in your jsbin to look like:



It'll have the same effect.

Again, the `click` that's fired by the browser after the touch event happens based on screen location not the element in a lot of browsers. Generally you just don't want to move the content based on a touch event. Worst case you'll need to bind to click instead.

This is unfortunately a limitation of the platform that we can't really work around.

http://jsbin.com/ibukaf/2/edit

You can see there that I'm just using a binding to touchstart to do the scrolling using `addEventListener`, some browsers will always fire a click after the fact where the other element used to be if you move the content on a touch event because of the 200ms+ delay for the click. 

If you need to scroll based on user input I would bind to the click and not a touch event, though there is indeed a delay.

This is a browser bug. IE treats that second click on the mouse wheel as a left mouse click (which would stop the mouse movement scrolling as well).
If you go to a non JQM website and you click a second time on the mouse wheel while the pointer is on a link, that link will be activated.
So there is nothing that we can do about it.

I've created a jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/6cL38/show/

A click on a submit button creates a hidden input for it which has to be removed on submit. Because you stop the submit by returning `false` from your submit function, the added input is not removed.

3712,2012-03-15 17:52:04,"Alright, after no small amount of investigation, I’ve figured out the issue here. This is a particularly strange Android bug, independent of jQuery Mobile—I’ve put together a test case here: http://wil.to/android-positioning

A fixed element that contains an absolute positioned element, which itself contains an absolute positioned element, will cause select menus on the page to stop responding altogether. So, in relation to jQM: a fixed header that contains a button that contains an icon, as in @felipegs’ jsbin ( http://jsbin.com/umaseb/2/ ).

By removing that nested absolute element (the red square in the demo link above) the select menu will work normally. Alternately, by removing the fixed positioning of the parent element—either by not disabling user-scalable in one’s viewport tag or by removing the fixed positioning.

Note that this behavior—intermittently working on the second tap but more frequently not working at all—seems to be limited to 2.3 in terms of select menus. With 2.2 nothing on the demo page responds to user interaction. 3.0 is unaffected (though, interestingly, interacting with the select menu on our Xoom running 3.0 causes the absolute positioned element to jump around by a few pixels, triggering nightmarish flashbacks to the days of IE6).

I’m working on this now, and may open a new issue related to this problem shortly. Just wanted to post an update for all involved.

I'll try to get a simplified test case that mimics the page structure up on jsbin when I get a chance. FWIW my fixed header actually has three icon-bearing buttons -- two are children of a `div.ui-btn-left` and have `data-iconpos=""notext""`, and the third is a `a.ui-btn-right` with the header `div` as its parent.

Is there any other way we can try to prevent the location bar from dropping?

Before implementing this, I did several isolated tests and found that changing the href to a hash-based value was the only way to prevent it, short of handling touch events that is.

I agree though, what we're doing here is not ideal, and potentially problematic for developers. Not sure what to recommend, since the virtual/touch events can't be trusted entirely for navigation...

The reason for switching is that closing a dialog changes the content of the page which can result in ""false"" clicks being fired after the fact if the `vmouse` plugin isn't able to swallow them.

If you need to automatically close a dialog, triggering the event on the close button is likely the wrong way to go about it. `$(""dialog"").dialog('close');` is a much better solution.

We're not likely to switch this back. Closing.

This is indeed a problem with your markup (pages nested inside pages). When you use a code inspector you will see all kind of problems, like content of head is placed inside the body.

I am closing since this is not a bug. The jQuery forum is the right place to get help with this. Additionaly, here is a link to info in the docs about the anatomy of a JQM page: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/pages/page-anatomy.html

Yes, the error is happening when operating on the markup for the page that is being loaded, so that markup is what we're really interested in.
",jblas,dcarrith
3677,2012-02-29 17:06:40,"I've tracked down the problematic button.  I'm not sure why it's causing a
problem though.  Other than the href being the last attribute in the a
element, I don't see anything out of the ordinary.  FYI, I'm using a
CodeIgniter function to create the anchor.

Here's the CodeIgniter code:

<?php $content_span = '<span class=""ui-btn-inner ui-btn-corner-all""><span
class=""ui-btn-text"">'.$cancel_i18n.'</span></span>'; ?>

<?php echo anchor('', $content_span, array('data-role'=>'button',
'data-rel'=>'back', 'data-direction'=>'reverse', 'class'=>'ui-btn
ui-btn-corner-all ui-shadow ui-btn-up-'.$theme_buttons,
'data-theme'=>$theme_buttons)); ?>

By passing in '' for the anchor, CodeIgniter uses whatever site_url is
defined in the config file (as seen below in the rendered markup).

Here's the markup that gets rendered if I go directly to the page:

<a data-theme=""a"" class=""ui-btn ui-btn-corner-all ui-shadow ui-btn-up-a""
data-direction=""reverse"" data-rel=""back"" data-role=""button"" href=""
http://www.mydomain.com/""><span class=""ui-btn-inner
ui-btn-corner-all""><span class=""ui-btn-text"">Cancel</span></span></a>

I'll keep trying to track down what's causing the issue.

Do you see anything wrong with the markup that gets rendered by CodeIgniter?

The scenario this addresses is the following: pagecreate will be triggered first, causing presumably all widgets to perform their enhancement synchronously in response to the event in whatever order the async script loading has caused their pagecreate handlers to become attached. Thereafter, pageinit is indeed emitted synchronously after pagecreate, but because it's a separate event, only the pageinit handlers will be called in whatever order the async script loading has caused their pageinit handlers to become attached. Thus there is no chance that those that wish to access the final DOM structure end up mixed in with the rest of the pagecreate handlers because of async script loading.

I suppose <widget>init has become an API since we have published it in at least one version, so restricting the event to page would be too late. However, triggering it from _init() is quite doable, and should remove the override.

3600,2012-02-23 10:22:29,"@kiliman, thank you for the investigation. I think what both `click` and `hashchange` are trying to do here is the following.

Suppose we are on page: http://site.com/mobile. Now we navigate to a new page.
- If hash is an #id, append it to the base Url. 
  
  Result: http://site.com/mobile#id
- If #hash/is/a/path, use it instead of the current pathname (i.e. instead of 'mobile' in my example). 
  
  Result: http://site.com/hash/is/a/path

If I am correct, it is probably best to create some general path helper function, like `$.mobile.path.hashToAbsoluteUrl()` and make both `click` and `hashchange` use it for consistency.

`data-direction=""reverse""` on the back button is meant to reverse the transition that what used when navigation to that page. It is not meant to reverse the transition that you set on that same back button link.

I updated your test page and set the transition on the link to page 1 on the homepage: http://jsbin.com/uhezan/4/
You will see that when clicking the back button on page 1 will result in a reversed transition to page 1, even if you have used the buttons in the navbar in the meantime.

A link inside an anchor element would be invalid markup:

We are talking about a link inside a label element. That's valid markup, but in case of JQM the label element of a checkbox gets button behaviour and styling.

I understand why you want to use it like that, but for the reasons I mentioned in my previous comments I wouldn't recommend it. That's just my opinion on good UI and touch-optimized. I think I would go for the separate link or a native checkbox.

For both scenarios here's how the framework behaves:

`#hash`: Given that `#hash` has neither a file extension or a slash, the framework assumes the hash is in fact an anchor or id reference and simply appends the hash transitioning to an existing embedded page. This is in large part due to the progressive enhancement approach the framework takes, in that, with JavaScript disable the link would still work in the same fashion by scrolling to the id reference of an embedded div in the page (assuming it's below the fold).

`#hash/foo`: The framework spots the slash and treats this as a relative path. If a DOM element tagged with that data-url isn't in the DOM it will retrieve it via ajax. Either way it then transitions to the page.

Addendum: 

`#hash/foo`: The framework spots the slash and treats this as a relative path, _concatenating it to the current hostname and pathname so that it can make the ajax request_.

- Due to the way each call to `filter` appropriates system memory, the performance cost of implementing gradients in older versions of IE stands to render pages unusable for users with older machines—a potential cost that far outweighs any potential benefits. I’ve done some research on the subject for a project of my own, and memory claimed by a call to `filter` cannot be reclaimed by declaring `filter: none` in IE6/7. In fact, it seemed to seize more memory each time `filter` was invoked in any way.
- We found filters to be generally unreliable, often requiring a number of additional styles in order to force them to display with any consistency—styles which may impact other browsers negatively, or at least stand to complicate custom styling.

If it’s functionality-critical that one’s site has gradients in Internet Explorer, one is absolutely free to add them to their project, as you have. I’m afraid it’s not something we would consider adding, at this point.

3565,2012-02-11 00:50:42,"@pkoretic - I agree with @wilto and there's actually a whole long story with these. We used to have filters for gradients - they were in during the alphas but we decided to go with -ms-gradient syntax for IE10 and go with flat colors for IE 6-9. There was a bug in IE9/WP7 that messed up rounded corners with filter-based gradients that Microsoft couldn't fix so we went with dropping the ugly filter and keeping rounded corners.

Why would you declare filter:none in IE6/7? It has to be set to gradient color, that specific rule is to  **avoid setting  filter:none in IE6-8**, 
IE9 users obviously have windows7 (newer PCs), and others just ignore the rule so IE6-8 seize memory once it's called for filter...

3558,2012-02-28 14:11:02,"Hi @toddparker, @Wilto,

I have some additional idea how to disable link button in IE. We can render link buttons in ‘buttons’ plugin instead of ‘buttonmarkup’ plugin. In this case we can use disable() and enable() functions for link buttons the same way as for general buttons. All we need is to add [data-role=’button’] to ‘buttons’ plugin initSelector and remove ‘:jqmData(role='button')’ from ‘buttonmarkup’ plugin initSelectior. It works for IE8/9. In this case we will have 'disabled' attribute and also 'ui-disabled' css class. 'disabled'  attribute will make the trick to make link unclickable for IE8/9. Unfortunately I found out that this approach doesn’t work for IE7 because it ignores ‘disabled’ attribute and link stays clickable. As a possible workaround we can temporary rename ‘href’ attribute in disabled() func to ‘hrefTemp’ and set it again in enable() func.
",sgrebnov,toddparker
3558,2012-02-28 23:01:41,"@sgrebnov Oh, I think we’re mostly squared-up on this now, including IE. The only thing we have left to do for the sake of browsers that don’t support the CSS <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/pointer-events"">pointer events</a> property is call `preventDefault()` (possibly `return false`) on link-based buttons that have the `ui-disabled` class attached.
",Wilto,sgrebnov
3558,2012-02-29 06:48:23,"@Wilto I see now, suppose we only need to add small change to buttonMarkup.js to handle click event specially for element with 'ui-disabled' class (preventing the call). I can add this change if you want (and if my understanding is correct)

So in reviewing your commit I noticed that we make two calls to `$.mobile.focusPage` for some reason. One in the `doneOut` callback in the transitions module and another in the navigation module in the promise resolution callback. Right near the second call I noticed a comment referencing issue [here](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1088). It appears I already fixed this issue before the transitions module was created ([fix](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/15f1c6de663e4babfd5a1c3d50161571b08cff56)) and all we really needed to do was remove the call in the `doneOut` callback.

I really like the idea fo this, but getting the behavior right is really important and will probably require a lot of finesse. Right now, this code will jump scroll the currently expanded collapsible to the top of the viewport when clicked so you can see the content within. Because this is a quick jump (no transition) and can jump you around quite a bit, this made the experience feel rougher and less predictable than just scrolling the page myself manually.

The biggest place where the current expand behavior feels odd if when the collapsible is at the very bottom of the viewport because when it expands, you may not see than anything happened. I might suggest that we only scroll the page if the collapsible is at or near the bottom of the viewport and that we only scroll the page a small amount, perhaps with some animation, to reveal enough of the expanded content to show what happening without jumping too much and disorienting the user.

I think this just transplanted the issue that jQuery had up into our code. The problem with swallowing the exception is that it's the same as not calling focus at all in IE. If we remove the focus call altogether then it doesn't much matter but if the focus call is important then we need to move the focus call to the point at which the element is visible.

@toddparker 

Can you comment on how important that focus is? (We focus the title on page load I believe)

Since this is a feature request, I'm going to close this but we'll re-open when we decide to look into this in a future release. Mind link this up to the feature request wiki page? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Feature-Requests

data-enhance=false data attribute

As of jQuery Mobile 1.0, all the markup within a page is scanned for elements to be enhanced. This is problematic for 3rd party widgets/libraries that don’t want anybody enhancing their markup or attaching behavior. We heard requests for a data-\* attribute that can be place on an element container to tells the framework not to enhance anything inside it for these situations. In 1.1, we’ve added a new data-enhance=false attribute that can be added to a container to prevent both auto-initialization and link/form hijacking. This is also available via $.fn.jqmEnhanceable. It’s important to note that because of the performance impact incurred by finding a parent element with the data-enhance=false attribute this feature must be turned on explicitly with $.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled=true.

data-ajax=false now works on containers

On a related topic, we’ve always offered the ability to disable the AJAX navigation system from hijacking a link or form submit via the data-ajax=""false"" attribute, but people have asked for a way to apply this exclusion more efficiently to a grouping of links. In 1.1, this is now possible by simply adding, and setting $.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled=true, the data-ajax attribute to a parent container and it will exclude all the parent link or forms from the AJAX navigation system behavior.

3496,2012-05-05 19:07:48,"hi @tigbro 

You are right about the cause of the problem and that means it might only require a minor change to make this work.

By adding the classes you mentioned (and ui-controlgroup-last) to the list of classes that have to be removed we can use the current controlgroup function to refresh a controlgroup as well.
Only difference with real widgets would be that you don't have to send the 'refresh' parameter: $(#mycontrolgroup).controlgroup(); This is something we would have to add to the info in the docs.

Here is a fiddle that loads a version of the JS in which I made the change: http://jsbin.com/agayas/11/
Of course it requires some more testing and thinking about edge cases but so far I don't see a problem.

I don't think controlgroup needs to become a 'real' widget because it is always used in combination with another widget (button, checkboxradio or selectmenu). So it is more like an extension of those.
Maybe we can make it work this way that when you refresh those widgets the framework checks if they are wrapped in a controlgroup and, if so, trigger controlgroup() on that element.

I am in favour of a grid widget! It would be great when the grid/block classes are added by the framework like it is done for navbars so you can dynamically inject a new block.

@offsky 
In your fiddle you use document ready. In the docs at the page about events you can read why you shouldn't use that. Also, you call .checkboxradio() after appending new button markup. That function is to refresh the button after you manipulated the state of it. When injecting one you should use .trigger( ""create"");

[Update: changed link to new version of fiddle after relocating JS file]

Setting the padding based on toolbar height is trivial, but I'm a little hesitant of constantly updating it on resize, since this may not affect the average jQM user (only those with taller toolbars). We already do a lot of that sort of thing on resize, and pageshow.

Questions:
- Should this behavior happen automatically, or would a public method that you could call when your app needs it be sufficient?
- If we set it up to update the padding automatically, should that behavior be optional? Do we default to on or off?

If I understand you right that pull request @toddparker is refering to is not related. That only concerns regular links in bars.

You are talking about anchor elements that are styled as buttons. In case you add a rule for a:visited this will apply to all buttons because a:visited has a higer level of specificity than .ui-btn-up-c.

To prevent this from happening a rule has to be added for the visited pseudo class for each theme/swatch, for each button state (up/hover/down). In case H5BP CSS has rules for a:hover and a:active two more rules has to be added to each theme for the hover and down state.

Why not just remove it from your H5BP CSS?

Thanks. I've looked at both the projects you listed below.

I really just wanted to know if the jQM group had an internal design for handling navigation within a window with multiple views.

I'll continue on with my navigation pane approach ( extensions to your navigation.js code in a pane widget supporting a stack of pages/views - the splitpane widget contains 2 navigation panes ). I'll send you a link to the set of widgets when I'm done.

3438,2012-01-16 19:53:47,"@ToddThomson - We do plan on tackling tablet tools later this year will will include things like panel navigation and overflow support on regions. Our goal will be to introduce small tools that will help people build responsive designs rather than build a monolithic panel plugin. 

The first baby step is the fetchlink plugin being worked on for 1.2. This makes it easy to leverage the nav model to load content into a region of the page. Fir example, you could have a layout like the docs with listview ont he left and detail on the right. Instead of a page refresh, you could make these fetchlinks that would load the contents of a page into the right pane (target) either via AJAX or local pages. The one thing we're not doing with fetchlinks is tracking them in the history stack so that may not work for all cases (tho this could be added).

Hope this helps.

Regarding your initial post:  
**page container**
I'm switching pageContainer as needed. If I'm loading a page into a panel, the panel becomes pageContainer, if it's a regular transition, the body is the pageContainer. 

**history**
this is tricky. I have a history set and am now trying to iron out things. I lock up JQM history and keep a browser history counter as soon as any panel history gets activated. Once all panel transitions are reversed, I let JQM history take back over. Works ok and saves keeping track of browser, jqm and your panel history.  Pushstate...

By default, pages loaded from _external_ documents are automatically removed from the DOM when you leave them. We'll need a bit more info from you so we can get a picture of what is going on.

These do sound potentially useful, but they sound to me like a jQuery core request rather than one for jQM, and probably more of a plugin, rather than a standard core feature at that. 

As an aside, I think formbeforesubmit sounds like the standard ""submit"" event, rather than a new one. You can bind to submit and prevent default to do what you're explaining, I think at least.

I'd suggest moving this event request to jQuery core's issues for discussion there. @jblas, do you agree?

3424,2012-01-14 13:09:12,"@scottjehl I don't have enough understanding of the inner workings of JQM or JQ to judge whether it should be in JQ, JQM or as a plugin. All I know is that I had to decide to use the build-in ajax handling of forms for my application and do some post processing or disable the ajax handling or JQM and write my own code. 

I choose to let JQM handle the ajax, and my php script (being called), does the  ""pre"" processing before it actually does the actual processing which my php was meant for. I would have preferred to do the preprocessing client side. As it was nothing critical I choose this solution. If it was critical I would have written my own ""form on submit"" handler. However I choose to keep my client side client and try to achieve as much as possible using the core JQM functions.

So what I am trying to say it that not having an build-in event for the form submit, just like the page events, I was ""forced"" to either use the JQM ajax form handling (which is pretty sweet), or make my own starting from scratch.

Just my 2 cents. Let me know what you think :)

Some time ago. 

I'm currently using the below, which more or less incorporates both suggestions from SO. I'm using both in order to mesh JQM with requireJS and my plugin.

(in order of being called)

overrides.js



app.js => app controller



multiview.js 



My problem was that JQM triggered on mobileinit and inits the first page before requireJS pulled in multiview (on docready) and set my `mainEventbindings`. Therefore multiview missed the inital page events triggering. 

I'm still using my hack from above - see [here](http://www.stokkers.de/test2012/members/login.cfm#/test2012/members/contact.cfm) for example (breaking controlgroups along the way ... [4773](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4773)). 

The above deeplink is handled by JQM ( 2nd option in initializepage - $window.trigger( ""hashchange"", [ true ] ); ) loading login and then contact (probably not the way it should be), while a panel deeplink (for example [here](http://www.stokkers.de/test2012/members/contact.cfm#languages)) ) will be handled by my hack, which has JQM load the first page (contact) and then trigger a pagechange to load the deeplinked page (languages).

I initailly posted on this issue, because I was looking for a way to re-direct panel deeplinks since without the hack, JQM will break trying to load the 2nd link. Looking at this now (after a while), I should be able to bind to `pagecontainercreate` from within my mainEventbindings and then re-direct accordingly if I still need to. 

So I'm more or less a happy camper. 

I would still be happy to see `pagecontainercreate` triggering on the `body` vs `window` though.

Calling changePage() can result in an asynchronous request to load an external page, in which case we can't give the caller a definitive answer. We currently fire off pagebeforechange and pagechange events which you can read about here:

I'll mostly defer to @gseguin on this, but your interest is greatly appreciated given your obvious familiarity with the subject matter!

Our primary goal, before even beginning with AMD, was to create a download builder so that people could slim down the library where possible. We obviously needed to determine dependencies and using AMD to do that resolution was a clear win over doing something custom (note: the deps themselves are still a work in process). The use of it in the docs and tests is just a happy coincidence that lets devs discard php while working on the library. 

The decision to use pragmas came after attempting to using sed in our build process which turned out to be clunky. We also wanted any reference to AMD to be discarded in our builds since we aren't really using it to define modules, just for dependencies. 

All that said, we are considering leveraging AMD in a more traditional manner (which I'm relatively ignorant of) by doing things  like you've mentioned and possible defining module exports.

Hopefully that gives you some insight into our motivation and why our AMD implementation looks rather stunted :D

There is the decision on whether to support different display modes for the spinner or just keep it simple:
- spinner only (default)
- spinner + text 
- text message only

I just pulled this into a branch—while it’s good to know that the positioning is somehow impacting performance, it looks like all the icons/thumbnails in listviews are broken by this change.

I think this bug could be the source of another problem I have on the same platform but I haven't had time to test it properly and build a small example that could reproduce it. I have a list of items in my app. Each of this items can be clicked. Also a long click (tap) on this item produces a popup menu which partially covers some items of that list. So when I click on the menu the click gets handled by the popup menu handler but the handler also closes the popup. What happens then is that the list item directly underneath the popup receives a click event (and handles it of course). I can not tell what is the source of the second event and I suspect it might be this issue. But that's a story for another bug report. Thank you again for your time.

I researched it a little bit and I found out that this happens while I attach an event while handling (in an event handler) an event of the same kind. In the case I described in the previous link I am handling a longtap event. This longtap event creates a popup menu which appears over some elements of the list. The handler of course attaches event handlers to the newly created menu elements. It seems to me that the newly created elements immediately receive the event that triggered their creation (which is not what I expected). The effect is that when I longtap the list element it creates the popup and it activates it in the same click. The solution was to delay the attaching of the events of the popup menu to when the browser has completed the current event loop.
Are you doing something similar in your code (attaching an event handler within an event handler)?

That's a separate/known issue. If you move content on touch events most browsers will fire a click on the _location_ of the tap event about 200ms later. They do this to support all the click bindings that are one traditional websites.

That means that if you move content on a touch event you're going to get a click in a random position.

Thanks for getting back to my post, I'm away from my computer right now so I'm trying to visualise this in my head. 

I'm not hugely familiar with JQ mobile as this is the first time I've used it but I think I can see what you're saying. The problem doesn't occur with regular <button> tags, so I'm assuming it's just the link based buttons, would you suggest I just write JavaScript links using onClick instead of links or would out suggest another method? 

I'm sure I've read somewhere that theres a line or so of JavaScript that prevents this problem but I can't remember where I saw it, is it something you're aware of?

I think we should leave the list management up to the user (hopefully a kvo library) and just rest on `refresh` as our update api. I think Knockout can do the management because it controls the js object representation of the DOM view on which it can do diffs, see [compareArrays.js](https://github.com/SteveSanderson/knockout/blob/master/src/binding/editDetection/compareArrays.js). I could be wrong on that score though.

In this case I think we'd trigger `listviewafterrefresh` at the end of the refresh method in `$.mobile.listview` and the your plugin could bind to it and ""sort things out"". Using the widget factory trigger for prefix/consistency:



Hopefully that will help with the `DOM*` events. We just aren't in the business of managing state after the initial enhance, it's up to the user.

Regarding your 20x speed-up ... you can get it even faster if you do 2 things:
- Don't use each() and instead manually loop through the collection with something like a for(){} loop. This avoids the function-call per-list-item penalty that each() imposes.
- Don't use the jQuery markup shortcuts to create elements, and instead use DOM methods, document.createElement() and element.setAttribute(), and element.insertBefore().

Thanks for these pointers. I've rewritten the code slightly to use
this approach (though on the 400 element list it makes negligible
difference, but I guess it could matter more on mobile devices).

> Would you like me to make the changes to listview to provide the event discussed above (listviewafterrefresh) so I can get rid of the DOM event watching?

Yah, go ahead and drop that trigger at the bottom of the refresh. 

> Are we agreed that the autosort functionality suggested by jblas should go into a separate extension and can be left out of autodividers?

Yes, or we can add it here later. Either way I want to get this merged in, we've dithered enough on all this hard work you've done.

> Are you happy with the implementation of the ""selector as function""?

I'm still of the opinion we should avoid supporting ""words-as-functionality"" in the same way we avoided it with the listview filter. I'd rather just provide a callback that's defined on the options where the default is the alpha check. Also, that way we can remove the ""type"" information because it will always just be a callback. The fact that it requires code change to alter the behavior is entirely acceptable. 

> Is it OK that it's not possible to reset options on this extension after it has been applied (because it's not a fully-fledged widget)? If that's not OK, what is the correct pattern to fix that?

I was going to do a quick refactor and move this off the global `$.fn` namespace and onto the listview prototype so the options can be altered at runtime there. The idea being that the invocation can be`$(""#my-list"").listview('autodivide')`, but the functionality can remain an external plugin that's removable from the build where it isn't necessary. If that idea bothers you as the original author please do let us know. Either way, we can handle making the options flexible.

[UPDATE] I didn't take a huge amount of time to understand the selector functionality so feel free to correct any assumptions I've made with the above.

Thanks for reviewing and merging, I'm really pleased.

I'm sorry, I can't make discussions this Thursday, as I'm already
pledged elsewhere.

On the HTMLElement being passed in: that provides the most flexibility
in choosing how the selector works, as you can access any of its
internal elements or their properties (obviously). The previous
approach was to just specify a selector instead, but a prior comment
on the pull request suggested the option should be set by supplying a
full function.

The advantage of a selector is it can be declarative (you could even
supply it via data-\* attribute), but obviously it's a bit more ugly
and maybe more cryptic.

I leave it to your judgement as to what the best way to go is.

Thanks again.

Q1

I agree it would be nice to have a `data-*` attribute for the option but putting it on the link itself seems odd in the same way that designating the page loaded should be a dialog is odd. In the case of `data-rel=dialog` the convenience is such a massive win that any weirdness and difficulty in implementation is forgotten. Otherwise we might end up with a bunch of dialog specific data attributes on the link. 

I think we should make it a page/dialog data attribute option. The only people we're pleasing by putting the data attribute on the link is the intersection of the set of people who don't know whether the linked page should be a dialog or a page at design time and the set of people who want to alter the default bottom corner behavior (small set of folks imo).

@toddparker can/should this be off by default?

Q2

The data attributes should be available in the `this.options` object in the dialog widget. If we go the above route that should be a non-issue.

3290,2011-12-21 20:38:44,"Regarding #1, some browsers don't clip the content inside of an element to it's border-radius, so if content inside a rounded element specifies a background, the corners of the content render over the rounded corners of the element. I believe this is why things like the custom-select pop-up (used when items fit completely within the viewport) use padding on the element to make sure the rounded corners show. In this particular case, the .ui-content container that is the parent of the listview specifies a 15px padding all around, but the non-inset listview by default specifies a -15px margin which basically negates the .ui-content's padding. We need to consult @toddparker, @wilto, and/or @scottjehl as to what the proper thing to do here is? Live with it? Add padding? I noticed that a listview inside custom-select dialog actually gets a unique class placed on it ui-selectmenu-list, but didn't see any rules defined for it.

Regarding #2, it would be nice if we could figure out what exactly is causing the slow down, and what contributes to it? Is it the number of items in the list? Is it  a specific style that's in use? What are you using as your test case for this? When you mention scroll lag, are you talking about when your finger is down and you are dragging things around? Or is it after you drag and lift your finger to scroll with momentum? I ask because I'm wondering if the lag is due to a redraw of the hover/down state on the list item you touched to initiate the drag?

Regarding #a, I think this should be done regardless. We don't want to introduce interdependencies between or knowledge of other components if we can help it.

Regarding #b, not sure what you meant by a ""different place"", but if there is another way to apply it that doesn't introduce this lag I'd be willing to hear about it.

Regarding #c, we don't want to do this. The rounded corners are a property of an ancestor of the listview so we don't want the listview dictating to it's ancestor containers/components how they should be styled.

Regarding #d we should do this if there is no solution/workaround. I also see this related to #1 ... if in the custom-select dialog case we see square buttons everywhere except WP7 and FF, then maybe we should disable it for all custom-select dialogs ... this is where the option in #a comes into play. It would be passed to the dialog() constructor in the custom-select code.

Regarding #e, yes it would be nice to know the ""why"" for listviews. Once again, is it because of the number of elements involved? Or is it because of some style that is used on _EVERY_ listitem?

I might be missing something here but omitting the `data-prefetch` has the same effect doesn't it? compounding pseudo selectors is generally bad for performance so I'm wondering what the use case is here.

The use case is a rails plugin, jquery_helper, which auto generates this markup. It has to make special cases here instead of just falsing.  But from this perspective, that's kind of what rails helpers are for :)

Being a rails dev myself I would agree :D. 

It's also something we need to consider in terms of semantics because native browser boolean attributes (disabled) are true with any value at all, though of course this is of course a data attr. Things to think about.

I am no longer maintaining jquey_helper as a gem, but would like others to know about if if they have a use, and am still around to fix bugs.  It handles a lot of markup generation (back and forward buttons, full with transitions), allows data attrs to be specified with their own hash, and even has a nav bar builder which keeps page transition directions straight.

Wow looking at your patch forced me to look at the baseTagTest() implementation. I really messed that one up cause this all used to work. Anyways, the current incarnation of baseTagTest() doesn't even test the dynamic changing of a base tag so I re-wrote it so it did. It looks like this:



So now my question, is why was it necessary to change the getClosestBaseUrl() to check $.support.dynamicBaseTag?
",jblas,jguyomard
3273,2011-12-21 19:24:21,"Ok, so I had some time today to look into this more. There are actually several problems.
1. baseTagTest() as implemented in 1.0 is not returning the correct support value in the case the document contains an existing <base> tag.
2. baseTagTest() as implemented in 1.0 does not test the actually dynamic change of the base tag in the case the document contains an existing <base> tag.
3. getClosestBaseUrl() assumes that the data-url path for a given page is the base when in-fact it may not be.
4. External documents that are loaded as pages can contain a base tag that uses a _DIFFERENT_ path from the application document that loaded it with AJAX.

The baseTagTest() re-write I posted a few comments back addresses both #1 and #2.

@jguyomard attempted to fix #3 by forcing the URL to be used to be the base if $.support.dynamicBaseTag was true, but the fix assumes that all external documents will have the same base, when in fact they won't, especially in the case where no base tag is ever used, but the platform/device actually supports dynamicBaseTag.

#4 is a known issue. We don't support the loading of external pages that specify their own <base> tag, which I hope to fix during the 1.x timeframe. I believe there is an actual issue already reported about it.

I think a better interim fix for #3, until we can add support for #4, is to modify getClosestBaseUrl() to do this check:



That way we can get the case where the application document contains a <base> and the external pages don't, working.

The alternative, would be to assume that all external documents pulled in are assumed to have the exact same <base> path which I think @jguyomard was thinking and instead check:



@toddparker and @johnbender, thoughts?
",jblas,jguyomard
3273,2011-12-21 20:58:20,"@toddparker 

Right, which is why I was favoring the first example where we limit the scope to the firstPage in the interim. We really do need to fix #4 which would also cover #3.

You need to set the data.options.dataUrl to what you want shown in the location bar.

FYI, we don't officially support query params for id hashes, but I wrote a plugin that will handle all of this for you:

https://github.com/jblas/jquery-mobile-plugins/tree/master/page-params

The plugin will read the params, parse it into an object on data.options.pageData, reset the data.toPage to use your #PDetails page, and set the data.options.dataUrl for you.

But facing your reply I decided not to park the querystring in the page hash but in the url as ""real"" query parameters, and then not to use a multipage approach but single webpages containing one page. This works fine now, after struggling with the DOM cache, as it takes not only the webpage-name but includes the query parameters as lookup-key, too. This leads to multiple DOM insertions when re-navigating the page (with just different querystring values) and breaks the DOM due to the then ambigious page-id.

I worked around this, but I think I'll make a feature request regarding this scenario.

The only way to branch behavior based on the server response is to bind to `pagebeforechange` and determine what to do in the binding. I would start with the docs 

http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html

In the callback you'll have to deal with either replacing the current page where there are errors or creating and transitioning to the new page when there aren't.

3252,2011-12-13 13:26:15,"HI John,

Here is the code snip I had been working on.



Where $u is a <ul> on the page that contains one or more <li> elements of questions. These 2 (or more) buttons needed to be added to the bottom of the page conditionally. No matter how many times I tried to get this this snippet to work, it just wouldn’t. The .controlgroup() method isn’t really documented (which I found from digging into the code), and when I did dig into the controlgroup plugin, I found there was an internal expectation that the controlgroup elements would have certain classes on them (.ui-btn). This change allows me to build up the expected HTML structure that supports the control group, render it as such and append it to the page. I had also moved that one flipClasses function out of the closure, but didn’t change it when I made the pull request on github. 

Though I have used github many times for source code, this was the first time I had actually interacted with an open source project before. I wasn’t 100% sure what the process was and decided since I am using JQM so much, I would really like to give back some of my time to the community. Is this the basic process to contributing to an open source project? I imagine it would have been more useful if I had put a use case example in my note when I made the commit, right? 

Thanks for the time John, let me know what you think about the commit. I am definitely interested in collaborating more with the JQM project.

It sounds like, just from eyeballing the pasted snippet, you might want to try triggering a create on the parent `$u`. This will alert the jqm plugins that they need to select on the child markup and enhance where necessary. That way you don't have to do it manually.

3252,2011-12-15 18:11:41,"Hey John,

Sorry I didn’t get back to you sooner. I had a busy last few days and hadn’t gotten back to testing the trigger() method. I did it today and it did work of course, so that’s cool. Thanks for the pointer on that.

I like the idea of also being able to call .controlgroup() on the object, just like I can call .buttonMarkup() on an element I want to be behave like a button. Do you see the value of being able to do that as well? Currently, controlGroup doesn’t really let you do that unless you know to class the controlgroup-controls with a ui-btn

Speaking of buttons, we found something really interesting this week in QA on our app. See, in some places, we use <A /> tags decorated like buttons, and in others (like on forms), we were using <input type='button' /> controls to act as buttons. Well, I had some functionality that was working fine for me and failing to do anything for our QA person. I asked him to screenshot his iPad and send me what he was looking at cause it sounded like maybe the screen wasn’t formatted properly. As soon as he did, he noticed a little line right in the middle of the two buttons he said weren’t working. You see, when I click a button, I click it right in the middle of the button, but when he clicks the button, we tends to use whichever thumb was closest to the button. In this scenario, the button was closer to his right hand thumb, so he was clicking the button towards the right of it (and you know how big these buttons are I presume). 

It turns out, the <input type='button' /> was actually in the left of the ""button"", though the decoration made it look like the whole thing was a button. If you zoom in the attached image, you can see the line we are talking about. 

Have you seen or heard of this issue yet? I planned on checking into it on github and going from there, just figured I would bounce it off of you real quick.

Thanks again and take care till then.

To answer your question:

If the page element is removed from the DOM we have to have a way to retrieve it when someone navigates back to it, thus the url.

I've taken the liberty of creating a [jsbin sample](http://jsbin.com/ibozun/2). The issue in the provided sample appears to be that the form submits to the same url (it's missing the action attribute) and then the `data-rel=back` link is a no-op because it's returning to the same dialog page. If you hit the cancel button twice after submitting it will go back to the original page which is the expected functionality. 

I'm going to close this unless there's more information that that sample is missing.

> I don't understand why a form that posts to the same URL (i.e., missing action attribute) would be ""expected"" to duplicate the dialog? I could see replacing it, but it doesn't make sense to me that it simply layers an exact duplicate on top of itself. 

In the sample, the dialog isn't duplicated. The previous one is removed. So it does in fact ""replace"" the dialog. 

> So, if this is the expected behavior, then is it safe to say that the official JQM position is that one should NEVER post to the same page?

As for the hash, there are a couple things at play here.

First, when traversing history, the library has to reconcile the url change with pages that might exist in the DOM or go out and grab them from the server. It does this by storing the url that generated the page/dialog on the div itself so it can find it later. Second, on form submission we can't assume that the server is rendering the same page each time so we create a new page even if the url would otherwise be a noop (eg no action form). Given those two things what you're seeing is that a new page is being created and animated onto the screen based on the form submission, then when going back through history entries (in this case with `data-rel=back` which is equivalent to `window.history.back()`) it finds an entry that references the url of the current dialog and simply removes the extra `&ui-state=dialog`. 

Given those two constraints, our hands are sort of tied.
",johnbender,jkane001
3227,2011-12-06 20:48:13,"@jkane001

So I've been noodling on this one a bit and I'm wondering if we can squash the history on form submission to identical urls to avoid the back button issue. This is problem for pretty much any form validation scenario (rails, mvc, etc) so it seems reasonable to support it. 

I'm going to run the idea by @jblas first and then I'll get back to you here.

[edit] s/truncate/squash/
",johnbender,jkane001
3227,2011-12-06 22:03:48,"@jkane001

So after discussing and thinking a bit more there are two solutions to this problem. Each has problems.
1. Squashing History: This is actually counter to how the browser works and breaks usability in that the browser creates a new history entry on each form submission which can then be navigated back through. Changing that here would be jarring, though as you pointed out we could provide it as an option.
2. Retain History: We could retain the rendered page of each submission allowing the back button to navigate the user through their previous submissions. Right now each page is being removed from the DOM because the page is, according to it's url a duplicate. The problem is that we'd have to devise some scheme for differentiating between the page urls so that when history is traversed forward or back, the navigation library can display the correct page.

Either one of these going to be tough to implement but I'll leave this issue open in the mean time. 
",johnbender,jkane001
3227,2011-12-15 18:04:39,"@jkane001 - One thing to note - I see you use `data-role=""dialog""` in the sample code but as of 1.0, `data-role=""dialog""` isn't supported but we have a new issue to add this feature:

",toddparker,jkane001
3227,2012-04-26 18:52:38,"@jkane001 

Just a quick update here. Rails does something very similar in submitting back the same url on form validation failure. Eg



The second submit is a no-op in jqm so it doesn't do anything. The quick solution is to differentiate the url that the form posts to with something like `?attempt=#ofattempts` and then add `data-dom-cache=true` so that the back button is supported. The above cycle becomes



Just beware that each failure is retained in the DOM with the addition of the caching attribute. If that's not clear just let me know. I'll post back here again with a code sample soon.

From my initial inspection it looks like the problem here might be `live`. `$.fn.live` works by waiting until the event bubbles up to the document element and then checking if the target matches the selected elements. As a result the event has already passed the form and the `preventDefault` is ineffectual. 

In the `live` [docs](http://api.jquery.com/live/) you can see they mention `preventPropagation` has the same issue.

3223,2011-12-05 22:14:11,"@johnbender I change the .live to .bind on jsfiddle and it seemed to work however in my mobile site changing it to bind has no effect and infact just bypasses that method. The reason for this is since I am using bind and also using php pages the form isn't created yet until the user goes to the navigation menu to the form. It is because of this I must use live so that it will get bound to it.

For example I am using $.mobile.changePage('customerForm.php', { blah blah});
",jostster,johnbender
3223,2011-12-05 22:27:21,"@jostster

One possible solution is to bind to `pagechange` which passes in the page information so you can check it and then use `bind` on the html that's been loaded into the page. Check out the `pagechange` event information at the bottom for the argument to the callbacks that will have the page information to check against.

Actually I would prefer to have an ajax on because the page looks better and when ajax is off I have another issue much more serious - in IE the button does not work properly. I have to click on the upper part of the button in order to work. Submit buttons does not work too when ajax is off. So this is much worse. In version 1,0 jQuery Mobile added (I believe in 1.0) for IE to see a links underscoring the button text which makes IE buttons to work because they are actually a link. Submit works too (I don't know why but it does). This is good enough to me.

So I will go with the ajax on definitely. Only this browser bar address URL's and hashes are causing me troubles. 
I will post the full layout.html I am using so if you please look at it and tell me what is wrong. I tested the same page 
with a template working without jQuery Mobile - onl jQuery and it works properly. But I like to use the same design for mobile to be used in desktop too. Actually it looks better on desktop no matter it is designed for mobile.

So your help would be greatly appreciated. I spend a lot of time to figure it out looking at jQuery Mobile forums and testing myself but obviously it is not enough.

The redirect issue isn't solvable until XmlHttpRequest2 see's better support and a redirect callback is added upstream in jQuery Core. If you are doing redirects on submission turning off ajax is really your only option. 

Also I don't see a form, which I assume is added as part of the template data binding, so I can't really help you address your issue. I need the html that's displayed in the browser from the server, but before jquery mobile has had a chance to enhance it.

Being that ie 7 doesn't have XmlHttpRequest2 it doesn't really matter in your case. I just need an example page that demonstrates the issue and _works_ on jsbin.com. Alternately stop by our irc channel at #jquerymobile on irc.freenode.net, and ask for help there.

I think your best bet is to check the reponse url on the raw xhr object against the stored request url from the submission to know if there's been a redirect. Otherwise I believe the url should be updated as normal for you.

It's actually pretty simple. The existing code that decides where to put the popup is repeated once for a location above the desired coordinates, and once for a location below. Then, the coordinates which are closest to those desired are chosen for the popup.

> In order for this to look polished, we'd need to set the arrow color to match the gradient color because it doesn't line up so that will add some complexity unless popups just use the flat bg color.

I'm not sure what we can do here, because the arrow is currently nothing but the bottom (resp. top) border of a 0-sized div whose left and right borders are transparent and whose border width is actually the height of the triangle. [Here's](http://www.infimum.dk/HTML/slantinfo.html) where I got the idea from. AFAIK borders cannot be gradients. OTOH, I recall one of the demos you added to the documentation was that of an image with a (X) in the top left corner sticking out of the body of the popup.

3218,2012-04-29 01:22:04,"This widget was exactly what I needed to provide a touch-friendly equivalent to tooltip help on forms for my current project. Thanks!

I noticed that popups with more than a very small amount of text end up extending beyond the vertical borders of the screen on small-screen devices. The following CSS corrects the problem:



I suspect that the behavior @huan086 describes above -- closing the popup with the back button -- is a feature not a bug. It makes  a lot of sense, given that Android users are accustomed to using the platform's built-in back button to dismiss dialogs and pop-up controls (like select menus).

That said, it might be nice to have a data-attribute option for a close button on these pop-ups. This would give less savvy users a more immediately obvious way to dismiss them. Two of my current project's four (non-me) testers immediately asked upon opening the popup help ""okay how do I get rid of this"" and ""where's the close button?""

Other minor issues:
- The background-dimming overlay doesn't apply to fixed toolbars, at least not to the true fixed toolbars of jQM 1.1.
- Some built-in padding would help improve the default visuals of the pop-ups by giving the content some breathing room. I realize this might not work for every kind of pop-up content, however, so perhaps it's best left to the developer's custom styles.
- The widget adds the `ui-corners-all` class to the outer `.ui-popup-container` div and `data-corners=""true""` to the inner `data-role=""popup""` div. However, the inner div never gets the corresponding class and the corners that go with it. Since the inner div has the higher z-index, the net result is square corners.
- If you have dialog transitions disabled globally and don't declare one for your pop-ups, there's an awkward lag to the appearance of the background overlay on mobile devices. It fades in and out smoothly on a desktop machines, but on my iPod Touch and Galaxy Nexus it appears all at once after a short wait. Should probably check the global dialog setting and show/hide the overlay instantly if dialog transitions are off.

3216,2011-12-16 20:05:53,"[ Here is an update from @scottjehl on his latest progress and new fixed branch ]

Okay so, first off, Mat and I wrote a pretty good feature test for position:fixed support, but unfortunately, it was pretty obtrusive (scrolling the window), and also gave inaccurate results in Android 2.1 – maybe some others too.

For these reasons, I’m now trying to build the feature to be enabled for all, and then opt-out a few troublesome browsers with brute force (read: browser detection. I know, I know…).

So, on the topic of that feature that’s enabled for all:

I just pushed a big update to the new css-fixed branch that begins work on porting the fixed toolbars feature over to CSS positioning. The branch contains a draft of a full rewrite of the fixed toolbars feature, which I think is good because there’s a lot of hard-to-understand cruft in the current one.

### Here’s a list of changes in place so far:
- I removed both jquery.mobile.fixHeaderFooter.js and jquery.mobile.fixHeaderFooter.native.js and added a new file “jquery.mobile.fixedToolbars”, which contains the new behavior.
- I moved all of the CSS related to this feature to jquery.mobile.headerfooter.css file, so it no longer has remnants in Core CSS.
- In iOS5, the feature works great for me. However, I’ve removed the iOS5-specific CSS touch-overflow handling from this plugin entirely, as it’s not needed for fixed positioning to work. It’s currently just using the default browser scrolling, which is nice because the momentum feels more natural than the overflow version. However, this change would mean that the transitions jump to top again in iOS5, rather than pinning in place, but I’m planning to tackle a change to transitions next that should make that problem go away (we’ll be prototyping a different transition style next that won’t need overflow support). Anyway, transitions aside, if we want to keep overflow-scrolling support in there, we can add the feature back again to a core file, since it’s unrelated to this plugin. It’s as simple as a class addition and a few lines of CSS.
- The plugin still supports both regular fixed toolbars and “fullscreen” toolbars (which overlay content, even when scrolled to the top or bottom), though it now allows the data-fullscreen attribute to be on the header itself, in addition to the page div, which we supported before.
- When the toolbars are fixed, but not “fullscreen”, the page div has top and bottom padding to accommodate the toolbar heights that are not there. This padding amount will likely need to be dynamically updated on load, resize, and though a manual method devs can use (ugh).
- Since page zooming can cause usability issues with fixed positioned elements, I’ve wired up the plugin to disable user zoom whenever a fixed toolbar page is active, but then reset the user zoom settings to whatever configuration it was in before, after the page is hidden again. (This currently has a bug in the reset part, but you can at least see that most of the docs are zoomable, but then you can’t zoom into the fixed toolbars page).
- The new plugin is written using the widget factory, which will make for easier testing and extension points, as well as options and methods support.
- This also means that the plugin is called per-toolbar, rather than per-page. I’m seeing some great benefits to this already, both organizationally for us, and for configuration.

### The following options are preliminarily supported:
- visibleOnPageShow: boolean for whether a toolbar should be visible when its page is shown
- togglePageZoom: if true, the plugin will disabled page zooming when the toolbar is visible
- transition: the transition for showing and hiding the toolbars. Currently it’s set to “fade”. “slide” also works, and slides the bars up and down from the vertical edges of the screen. This option can also be false, for no transition.
- fullscreen: boolean, formerly only a data attribute, which allows for “fullscreen” overlay toolbars
- tapToggle: tap to show and hide the toolbars. Preliminary support is in place, and enabled for testing purposes. Note that this feature probably should not work if the user is scrolled to the top of the page and the toolbars are not “fullscreen”. Otherwise it just hides and leaves whitespace, which is odd.
- scrollToggle: show and hide the toolbars during scroll. This isn’t quite working yet, and in hindsight, I should probably pull it out and replace it with an option for “hideonScrollstop, which hides the toolbars when you STOP scrolling, allowing you to bring them back again with a tap. The NYTimes iOS app does this and it’s pretty nice. The code weight would only be a few lines for that feature.
- supportBlacklist: the dreaded browser detect blacklist! So far, I’ve opted out iOS versions older than 5 (please verify), and Opera Mini. I still need to add detection for Android webkit older than 2.2. Since this is an option, people can improve it or remove it too, or try to polyfill it, which is nice. We should do some spoof-testing on this too, especially on BB!
- initSelector: defaults to‘)”, for auto-initializing. The plugin auto-inits on pagecreate and create, like most others.

### The following methods are also supported:
- show: show the toolbar
- hide: hide the toolbar
- toggle: toggle the toolbar
- destroy: just for class removal so far
- disablePageZoom: the function used internally for disabling user zoom. This may be best left private, we’ll see.
- restorePageZoom: opposite of above. Again, should probably be private.

I’ve posted a demo of the branch so we can begin testing it as I work on bugs and unit tests. The tapToggle option is enabled, just for fun, but I’d imagine it’ll be off by default (yes?).

3216,2012-01-22 16:37:47,"I've encountered a few issues with the new fixed position code.  @barbalex and @AbhinandanPanda have mentioned some of them.

1.) The tap to toggle is also triggered when clicking buttons on pages (or LI items, etc) with fixed headers/footers (I suppose it's just when you click on anything since @barbalex mentioned that it happens when trying to focus on form inputs too).

2.) Sometimes the fixed header will toggle, then it's just gone (i.e. if I scroll back up to the top, it isn't inline at the top as it should be). At that point, the only way to get the header back is to scroll down enough for it to be toggled on a click and then click to toggle.

3.) I know this has been mentioned in the 3217 thread, and I'm not sure if it could have been caused by the fixed position changes, but maybe.  I have two buttons in a data-role=""header"" role=""banner"" div that were showing up fine before I pulled down the latest code to test this fixed position issue.  

The first issue deals with buttons with only text in them (no icons).  The ellipses truncation is cutting text off sooner than it did in the official 1.0 release.  Noticed on a couple devices running some form of Gingerbread then Tested on Chrome, Safari and Firefox running on OSX.  It seems that it's just an issue caused by a change to when that ellipses truncation kicks in.  On the browsers running on OSX, I have to set the width to somewhere between 692 and 696 or so to get a six and seven letter words to show fully.  There should be plenty of space even when rendering on a mobile phone browser.  Two buttons in the same row are allotted 28% each (total 56%) of the width of the page.  

The other issue is with two buttons that are on a fixed position footer.  The two buttons only have an up and down arrow icon in them.  For some reason, the width of the button is rendering much more narrow than it used to.  So, it's not wide enough to show the whole 16px wide up and down arrows.  Those are the only two things on the footer.  With the official 1.0 release, I could have the space allocated for the two buttons at a 10% width of the page.  After pulling down to test the fixed position code, I have to give them about 25% of the width of the page in order for them to render properly.  Certainly 10% should be enough for rendering a little button with a 16-24px button on it.

When testing http://jquerymobile.com/branches/css-fixed/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html on FF 8.0.1 (Mac OS) and Safari 5.1.1

All works fine, but there is a minor bug:
Scroll down a bit so that you still have some of the ""secondary display"" menu on the left handside, and so that the header bar is over the menu. click the window to toggle the fixed bars. The header and footer bars disappear from the screen. Scroll to the top of the screen (the header bar is right at the top as expected). Now, click the window again to toggle the fixed bars. Slowly scroll down. You'll see that the secondary display (left hand0side menu) goes over the header bar, and the form elements also go over the bar.

All works fine, but there is a minor bug:
Scroll down a bit so that you still have some of the ""secondary display"" menu on the left handside, and so that the header bar is over the menu. click the window to toggle the fixed bars. The header and footer bars disappear from the screen. Scroll to the top of the screen (the header bar is right at the top as expected). Now, click the window again to toggle the fixed bars.

Thanks for the help and feedback. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that test URL is not updating properly. Some fixes that landed days ago negated several of these issues, such as the ""the footer displayed in the middle of the screen "" bug, so if you can pull down the code for now, that's the best way to test.

We'll try and get the urls fixed asap.

3216,2012-01-25 13:44:20,"@scottjehl, thanks for clearing that up.  I think I might have confused a description of the code changes (I think you announced somewhere) with expected behavior.  I think one of the changes in the code was to put the header and footer markup in divs where they would naturally occur in the dom (i.e. where they would exist if the page just had normal un-fixed headers and footers) and then let the code reposition them when needed.  

 I guess it makes sense to chuck them off the page since the whole reason the user is tapping to hide them is to make more room in the viewport.  For my application in particular, it leaves a noticeable gap at the top and bottom of the page.  I'll likely turn off the ability to tap to hide them.  If I was going to have that functionality enabled, I guess I would have to handle the gaps at the top and bottom better (like move everything up at least).  
",dcarrith,scottjehl
3216,2012-01-25 14:17:24,"After pulling with: git clone git://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile.git 
I compiled and then moved the css and js files into place then cleared Chrome's browsing data from the beginning of time (Chrome v.16.0.912.75 m on Windows 7).

1.) While at the top of the page, if I tap to hide, the footer is chucked off the page, but the header remains in place where it naturally exists on the page, and it is no longer fixed.  

So, either the header needs to also be chucked off the page (to be in ""fullscreen"" mode) or the footer should fall inline at the bottom of the page where it naturally occurs in the dom (like the header is doing).  Or, maybe the header just had not gone into floating/fixed mode yet since I hadn't scrolled at all.

2.) While somewhere in the middle of the page, tapping to hide seems to work great.  It chucks both header and footer off the page entirely (goes into fullscreen mode correctly).  However, bringing them back only works as expected if I remain somewhere in the middle of the page.  If I scroll all the way to the top and try to tap to show, only the footer shows.  If I scroll all the way to the bottom and tap to show, only the header shows.  

3.) This one is interesting.  Scroll to the middle, then tap to hide, and they both hide.  Scroll to the top, and tap to show, and only the footer shows.  Scroll back to the middle, then tap to hide, then tap to show, and the footer shows but the header only shows for a second before it gets put back inline at the top of the page.  The opposite scenario is also true.  

I also just tested on an original iPad running iOS 5.0.0 and had the same experience.  

Just tested on in stock browser on CM7.1.1 on a Thunderbolt (Android v2.3.7) and got slightly different results.  Here are the differences:

1.) The footer is chucked off the page and the header remains in place, and it is still fixed.

2.) Same issues as above

3.) Could not recreate this one on my Thunderbolt.

3216,2012-01-26 15:04:25,"@scottjehl: I just pulled down the latest and am seeing some great improvements.  It seems like you've addressed everything that was reported yesterday.  I have noticed a few issues that are a bit more esoteric and may just be caused by the way in which I've implemented something in my application.  I haven't been able to reproduce them consistently though, so I'll report back on those later if I can identify something that might be related to the changes made for 3216.

There is one thing I've noticed that is probably related to the changes made for 3216.  In my header, I have a back button and a home button.  If I'm scrolled down in a page of Artists, for example, and I tap either of the buttons in the fixed header toolbar, it seems to usually register the tap event on the element below the fixed header toolbar.  So, instead of going back, it selects whatever artist li element is under the toolbar.  It doesn't seem to happen in Chrome on Windows 7, since I guess that isn't a tap event.  It happens frequently on iOS5 and Android 2.3.7 stock browsers.  If I very carefully do a kind of long tap (but not long enough to be a taphold) on the back button, I can most of the time get it to go back.  But, it wasn't like that before these changes were made.

3216,2012-02-06 04:45:33,"Okay, folks, I think we're probably in as good of shape as we're going to get with this one. Support is looking great on a boatload of devices, and falls back respectably in most others we've tested.

My latest commit allows for toggling in Android while ensuring fixed toolbars still stay fixed at pageload, on most Android 2.3 devices, such as the emulator, and I'm assuming many other popular devices.

@toddparker with your testing confirmation, I'd like to declare this one ready. Here's some additional detail of what I found today:

There are some edge cases to fixed support, even within OSs that are supposed to work: I've found at least 2 stock Android 2.3 devices (HTC devices with Sense UI, and Samsung Galaxy Mini) have webkit ports that do not allow user scaling to be disabled at all through any apparent means. While this is generally a good thing for users, it means position: fixed doesn't work in those places either, since zoom must be disabled on 2.3 for that to work. In these platforms, you'll get scrollbars that scroll with the page content and reposition after scroll. Opting them out of fixed will mean slicing our UA detection even further to target specific carrier implementations of 2.3... the need for a solid feature test is getting even more important!

I found that you can actually get position:fixed to work on 2.3 without disabling user scaling if you apply a 3D transform to the fixed elements. However, that transform prevents the elements from being toggled to other positioning models, like absolute, which is a feature we need for supporting our toggling. Not helpful for us, but maybe for others. Here's a sample page with zoom enabled that works on 2.3: http://jsbin.com/izakek

In the commit above, I noticed that zoom wasn't properly being disabled on common Android 2.3 devices with our $.mobile.zoom utility, and adding user-scalable=no to our existing maximum-scale=1 disabling value seemed to fix that without disabling zoom for good on iOS...

Anyway, it's clear that there are some implementations out there that this may cause some issues in. We'll have to watch it closely, and if anyone has ideas for a new approach to feature testing fixed (that doesn't introduce false results on some platforms), we are so interested :)
",scottjehl,toddparker
3216,2012-02-08 17:39:10,"@hallatore That's right. The new fixed toolbars in 1.1 rely on a browser supporting position:fixed. If this isn't supported, the toolbars will simply scroll with the document. The older technique where we dynamically re-position the bars after scroll won't be supported in 1.1 because this technique adds a fair amount of code weight and isn't super reliable (bars scroll with the page, etc.).

It would also be really nice if jqm could get the js to the bottom of the page, and do most of it's fancy ui tricks in a more bootastrap css style of way (modularized). Right now the choice between jq+m, jquery+bootstrap, or jquery+handcoded is pretty hard when doing multi-lingual, multi-domain, multi-navigator dynamic white label websites. But i'm sure that in the next 1 to 2 years to come, all these progressing technologies will kick some serious butt out of native clients :)

Pretty sure jq.UI 2.0 or 2.1 will have something to say about this too ^^

John,
I agree that the ""pageinit"" event is documented..  My point is that the documentation references a pageInit() function and implies that it should be invoked.   Nearly the first thing on the page is ""Important: Use pageInit()"".  As nearly as I can tell that function does not exist (at the user level).  While the text describes binding to the ""pageinit"" event, the mention of a pageInit() function is fairly confusing.

Since there is no reason to show B to the user, we want to redirect as quick as possible.  It's weird, I know.

On Webkit browsers, if a user got to C1 and clicked a link to C1a, then clicked Back, the user would be taken to page B instead of C1 because the history stack was missing a page.  We used the setTimeout workaround.

Short version:
Start at **A** submit form to **B** redirect to **C1** click link to **C1a**... Back button goes to **B**.

It appears, at least on first inspection that calling `changePage` inside of an early binding fired by `changePage` is probably the root of the issue. The `setTimeout` workaround seems to support this. I'm not entirely clear what it is that's causing the consistent difference between handling by the js engines + webkit (your sample works in my chrome). You'll note that the `$.mobile.activePage` does reference the correct div (`page2`), which seems to suggest that the issue has to do with the application of transitions (which we do a bit of simple locking on).

In any case if you bind to `pagechange`, which in this case is semantically equivalent to ""wait until the first page loads and then redirect"", my testing on Safari shows you won't run into these issues because it's triggered at the tail end of the previous `changepage` call and the transitions have completed.

So I stopped to think about making this alteration to the various `$.fn` plugins. In the same way it doesn't  make sense (to me at least) to just exclude elements from widget enhancement implicitly by adding logic to our `_createWidget` decoration, it doesn't make sense for someone to call `$(""foo"").controlgroup()` and only have some of the elements enhance without an obvious reason why.

Instead I've added `$.fn.jqmEnhanceable` (open to naming suggestions) as a collection pruning method so that wherever these fluent helpers are called it will be obvious where to look for the exclusion logic. 



I'm going under the assumption that I should add these to all the callsites of all the plugins internally because these data-enhance false containers could live inside widget markup that might contain something that requires `buttonMarkup`.

3153,2012-02-21 20:13:53,"@jblas 

Two questions.

Is the following too clever and/or not cool because we don't prevent the original binding?



Where `selector` is ""form"" for forms and nothing for links (they are handled at the document level) and each of our bindings checks for the `mobile.ignore` property and returns early.

Are we namespacing event object property additions? If we aren't it might be a good idea to start doing that. From the above:

",johnbender,jblas
3153,2012-02-22 02:23:24,"@johnbender 

If I'm not mistaken, the proposed solution is a bit more expensive than simply calling a function, from our ajax click/form handlers, which traverses manually up the ancestry hierarchy from the link/form looking for said attribute.

The reasons I say this is because:
- placing a click/vclick/submit handler at the document level, as in the patch, will cause that code to evaluate the selector against _EVERY_ click/vclick/submit that is generated within the document. This will be done in addition to the evaluation that is already done to determine if it is a form/link we should handle.
- Using sizzle to evaluate whether a given node or its ancestors satisfy a selector is often slower than just using ele.parentNode and checking to see if that attr/value exists.

Also adding:



means that _EVERY_ jQuery Event object will share the same mobile instance object, which means once event.mobile.ignore is set to true, it will always be true for all events because we never set it back to false.

http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-search-filtertext.html

You should file a new issue for the filter event request.  Alternatively, you could have a high frequency timer checking whether you have text in the filter input and any listview items that match `$(""#mylist"").children(""li.ui-screen-hidden"")`.  If you don't want to use a timer, you could bind it to the `change` and `keyup` events on the filter input, but then you'd have to make sure the jQM filtering was complete before you ran the check.

On forcing the filter to be reapplied: I haven't tested this, but I'm pretty sure you can just trigger the `change` event on the filter input after you add items, since jQM's filtering function is bound to the `change` and `keyup` events.
",jakeboone02,offsky
3149,2011-12-12 23:34:40,"@frequent

Each UI component in the framework is self-contained. The way they hook into the enhancement mechanism is by binding to the pagecreate event at the document level. This means that anytime an instance of a page component is _CREATED_, each component handler will get invoked. These handlers usually search for elements (by tag name, by selector) underneath the page element that is the target of the ""pagecreate"" event.

Pages within the framework are created by invoking $.fn.page() on a jquery collection that contains a page element. Because the Page component is implemented as a UI widget, you can really only call $.fn.page() on a given element once. Subsequent calls to $.fn.page() as a constructor are ignored since an underlying page object already exists for that element. This means the ""pagecreate"" event is only fired once _EVER_ for a given page element.

This is why @scottjehl added support for a generic ""create"" event. The intent was that the ""create"" event could be triggered by developers, for a page that was _ALREADY_ created, to wake up the UI components to search for newly added markup, within the target page, they should enhance.

Most components, excluding the page component, listen for ""create"" events.

That all said, if you inject page markup into the DOM and then navigate to it, the new page should be enhanced automatically for you. Is this not the case?
",jblas,frequent
3149,2011-12-13 00:04:32,"@jblas  

thanks for the detailed explanation. I looked up my code in question again. I had hoped for an automatic-enhancement as you described, but when setting up my plugin, the default pages (_jqmData(data-show=""first"")_) on every panel did not enhance. I guess this is because the panels containing these pages are wrapped in a JQM-page, which did get enhanced, so subsequent pagecreate events don't fire for a seemingly reason. 

I tried&errored my way to this:



which works.

I had hoped to get by without calling page(), because it seemed to mess up other parts of the plugin, but once I could make sure, the above only fired once, everything was ok. 

So I guess I can close. Thx again. 
",frequent,jblas
3149,2011-12-13 07:49:14,"@jblas 

Correct. (wrapper-)page contains panels contains nested pages. I was trying to figure out how to enhance the first page on each panel. Subsequent nested pages are working fine.

I'm trying to do support both pages on board during creating/init of the wrapper page (I'm labelling with _data-internal-page=""true""_) as well as pages that are injected afterwards. So far this seems to work ok.

Just a thought, but if an application shows issues, if a link is double clicked or if a second link is clicked before the page-transition of the first clicked link is finally executed, would it not be an option, to set ajax-links to synchronous? 
Such as `<a href=""#foo"" data-ajax-sync=""true"">go foo</a>` (plus an global ajax-sync-call option for whole applications)
I help myself with something like that when starting an database-transaction via ajax with a click and wait for the result (for the impatient users [sometimes for me too]).

I make all the pagechanges throw ajax and prevent with e.preventDefault event the url loading.

It means
- I click into a list link it shows a loading image into the the same link
- Then I make the ajax call
- Before the ajax finish, the user click into the link below and make another request.
- Then the first ajax call finish and make the page transition change.
- Then the another ajax call finish and make another page transition change.

There is a way to cancel the click, @jblas what do you mean with ""Block the click handler"".
How could i make it work.

I could unbind ('click') and disable all the page links, and after the page transition finish, could enable all the links again.

Here are as many details as I can collect.
1. In all tests I was running code from my original report: http://jsfiddle.net/eq5bP/10/ 
It links to jQuery 1.7.min.js and http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js
Instead of hosting code on jsfiddle I ran my own webserver serving static file (to elliminate any chance of code modification).

2) In Chrome 17.0.963.65 on Mac OS X 10.6.8 I get vertical scroll bar and :
  a) after page load scroll bar is not visible, footer present
  b) after a click on the page vertical scroll bar is displayed, footer stays on screen
  c) second click brings display back to stage (a)
Screenshot for step (b): http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/96/screenshot20120306at122.png/

3) on iPhone 4S half of the screen is white, on page tap footer jumps from bottom to the middle of the screen and back.
Screenshots: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/804/photojr.png/   and   http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/705/photo1ex.png/

4) Chrome for Android and native Android browser behave very similar to iPhone. The only difference is grey/white border is slightly lower in Android Chrome.

And so we come full-circle, almost all the way back to what the original implementation used, which used $.fn.hasClass() which basically does a string indexOf() under the hood which this pull request is proposing.

The one thing we were trying to do with hasClass() was make sure we didn't get any false positives since some of the button hierarchies built up use classes like ui-btn, ui-btn-inner, ui-btn-text, etc.

It would be interesting to weigh the original hasClass() against the current 2 in the jsperf above.

3122,2011-11-21 21:12:20,"@eddiemonge

You switched it from $.fn.hasClass() to using split() and Array.indexOf() here:

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b0db897654644d6a9d5523e9299558231ac06105#js/jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup.js

which was a problem because IE7 (WP7) didn't support Array.indexOf so @Wilto switched things to $.inArray():

If you can add a test here and the documentation I'll merge this in. The test will probably require a couple things:
1. The form with a file input
2. A binding to preventDefault after the one added in nav
3. Stubbing/Unstubbing `changePage` to record if it was called (which it shouldn't be) when there's a child input that matches the selector.

- href=""twitter.com/""

The second check looks for starting "".."" and also has to end in /:

- href=""../demos/""

What you observed on the desktop is actually a behavior we use to clip both the current page and the page we are about to transition to, to the width and height of the viewport. This smooths out transitions on some of the platforms, but as you noticed this doesn't work quite well on the desktop, where there is an actual scrollbar that ends up resizing the content area.

3088,2011-11-21 19:46:06,"@tor-jorgen: Could you put together a reduced test case, and see if this issue still exists? We’ve determined that wrapping the page in certain elements with certain styles attached can break inputs on Android—it may not be related to jQM. In particular, Android 2.2/2.3 seem to take issue with setting `overflow: hidden` on an element wrapping the entire page.
",Wilto,tor-jorgen
3088,2012-02-27 20:25:19,"It is somewhat clunky, but I corrected this issue in my own custom animation framework by rendering new content underneath the current content. Then I slide the current content away with a transition to reveal the new content. This way, the elements start out life on-screen and visible (just covered over).

Unfortunately if you want to support Android < 3.0, then you may have to rule out any transition that starts out off-screen and/or invisible / hidden.

Androud is very tweaky with CSS so adding extra wrappers can cause issues. We've also noticed that some HTC devices have even more oddities, perhaps caused by their customizations to Android.

First, I’m having trouble recreating the original issue using 1.0 final—I’m thinking this may now be a non-issue. @mdhari, if you’re still seeing the issue using the latest, feel free to re-open and I can investigate further.

Second, the issue where the content and page are both getting the same gradient: we’ve redone the way theme inheritance is handled such that setting a theme on the page doesn’t automatically apply the same theme to the content element—so, you don’t see this doubled-up gradient effect unless a theme is explicitly set on the content, which it seems to be in the jsfiddle examples above. Setting a theme on the page _only_ will give you that full-height background without the strange line beneath the content element.

So I was able to reproduce the problem with a static markup snapshot of the selects page mentioned above with the states select-menu showing. I can remove all jQuery Mobile js and add a really simple click handler that just places the pop class on both the select menu and the main page, and I see the same blinking.

To be clear, the select menu is _NOT_ being re-opened by jQuery Mobile, the browser itself is re-displaying the transition ""from"" element upon completion of the animation, and then corrects itself on the next re-flow and paint.

The problem seems to be related to the size/complexity of the elements (pages) being animated and the duration of the animation. For example, if I adjusted the animation duration from the default 350msecs, in the CSS, to 1sec, the browser does not show the ""from"" element at the end of the animation. Alternatively, if I adjust the size of the ""to"" page and/or the from ""page"", by commenting out content so that they are shorter, the problem also goes away.

Folks always recommend making use of -webkit-backface-visibility:hidden, but that doesn't work in this specific case, probably because it exceeds some size threshold ... besides my device doesn't support GPU acceleration anyways.

The only thing I can recommend to folks for now is to use the native select, or disable animations for Android.

In the meantime, I'm going to try and allocate some time to try and figure out what these size thresholds are that trigger, the problem.

I suspect you are binding too late. The framework initializes itself and the first page on the ready event just as you are doing above, but it's ready handler is probably executing, as well as the notifications in question, before your handlers are even registered.

Since you are binding to the document, you don't need to wait for the ready event.
",jblas,offsky
3060,2011-11-15 18:37:03,"@offsky

You can also verify that they are indeed firing properly if you just include this in your application document and watch your console:

I loaded the following URL:

3060,2011-11-15 19:44:13,"@offsky

I just took a random jqm document and included:



in it, and then tried to load the document with a fake hash. If you do the same, you should see the same console output I did.

Regarding your previous question, yes, the framework initializes itself during the DOM ready notification. As part of that initialization, it attempts to set up the first-page that should be visible, which results in the page notifications. So are you just looking for a way to initialize your code _BEFORE_ jQuery Mobile initializes? Or are you asking how/when should you attach your event handlers?
",jblas,offsky
3060,2011-11-21 18:39:39,"@offsky

What exactly do you mean by ""document is ready""?

By default, the framework tries to bind to the document markup before the browser's onload event fires so that it doesn't have to wait for images to finish loading, etc. You can actually control when the framework initializes by setting the $.mobile. autoInitializePage config option to false, and then calling $.mobile.initializePage() when you are ready.

3053,2011-11-15 17:38:11,"@epsd - I'm not sure I understand. That second bin shows that if you set it on the content, it works. 

The only question is whether we should automatically copy the swatch from the content theme up to the page wrapper to ensure it's full height, regardless of content length. That seems like a good idea, but I don't know if that could cause issues for people if they are doing something custom. Might be over-reaching.

From the example in the bug, `$(""#myslider"").val('').slider('refresh');` , it appears that your check is sort of disjoint from the check against null above.

2913,2011-11-02 21:47:27,"@ora726 - No offense, we appreciate the feedback. We do take performance seriously, and we understand on some older devices, page performance may not be as good as we'd like right now if you have a complex page like yours may be. Performance falls into a few broad categories that we're already tracking closely on the project:
- Startup/Initialization time
- Page loading 
- Page enhancement time
- Page transition performance
- Touch responsiveness
- Scrolling smoothness
- Memory use

Of these, we've made good progress on memory use through our DOM cache feature and have been doing a lot of optimizations to speed up page enhancement time this week by hunting around for places to reduce function calls (more details to follow on the blog post for 1.0).

Other issues, like touch responsiveness and scrolling smoothness are very complex issues to solve. The quirkiness of how touch and mouse events are dispatched by various platforms is very hard to normalize, with Android being a particularly buggy. We've tried to re-approach these events a few times but we've convcluded that any changes to the event system will be too disruptive to attempt for 1.0 so these will be a priority for 1.1. 

Transition smoothness is being addressed in two ways. First, we've introduced the touchOverflowEnabled feature to take advantage of iOS5's support of overflow: properties for smooth transitions and fixed headers. We're working with browser makers to focus on supporting overflow: and we should see movement on that soon. This feature is off be default as we work through refining this since iOS5 was just released but we see this is the future. For older and less capable devices, we're starting to think about creating new transition types that look better within the constraints of our supported browsers and these will be part of a larger transition re-factor for 1.1.

Lastly, there are some things that we just can't detect at the moment, including hardware horsepower and connection speed, that would help us better target functionality. Right now, there are some older devices that pass our support tests and qualify for the enhanced experience, but may be somewhat pokey at running JS or rendering CSS. Ideally, we'd be able to detect that these devices are struggling and downgrade them to the C grade experience, but there really isn't a good way to measure performance this way and we're not willing to wade into dealing with user agent detection because that is unsustainable.

In general, if you keep pages pretty lightweight performance will be acceptable on most devices (old Android 1.5 devices are a clear exception). In the case of your PhoneGap app, you do have a much bigger DOM because your whole app is stuffed into a single page so I can understand that could cause issues if things are complex. It seems that there would be ways to pull content in as needed to reduce memory use, but I can't speak to specifics here.

I'm going to close this issue because it's sort of a catch all that is covered elsewhere, but I assure you that this is a priority for us to continue refining as we move into the next release. 

Cheers,
Todd

2911,2011-11-01 23:47:19,"@eddiemonge They're wrong, from my view using several different ip addresses (diff parts of the states) at the page I linked in the issue report: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0rc2/docs/pages/page-titles.html. 

For example, right now on the site it says: ""When you load the first page of a jQuery Mobile based site, then click a link or submit a form, the jQuery Mobile uses Ajax to pull in the content of the requested page."" And, I changed that to ""When you load the first page of a jQuery Mobile based site, then click a link or submit a form, Ajax is used to pull in the content of the requested page."" Saying ""the jQuery Mobile"" just seemed awkward to me, and I didn't think it needed to be repeated again in the same sentence anyway. 

Also, right now on the site it says ""The title of the HTML docuemnt will be,"" but the source in git has that already fixed. 

Anyway, I was just perusing the docs whilst just getting started with jqm, and noticed a few things. I'll be reviewing more over the coming days, and if I see stuff I'll note it (if that's helpful?).

Three quick updates that I made you might be interested in. 
- `$.fn.attr()` -> `$.fn.prop()` 

`disabled` is a boolean attribute and per the 1.6.1 docs `prop` is the prefered method for accessing and updating booleans on elements. Credit to @eddiemonge for pointing this out and helping me to understand that the distinction pertains mostly to boolean properties.

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/0ffaab8d223733a3695328630e5e9902f570baa1
- I chose to reference the text wrapper element directly instead of exposing the implementation via the class selector. This way the `buttonMarkup` helper can change how it creates and references the element without anyone having to know about the details.

2865,2012-07-03 07:11:10,"> If you either deep-link (or refresh) a page in the docs that has a heading bar, the framework is incorrectly overriding the page title with the contents of the heading tag in the header instead of just leaving the title alone.

I don't believe this is incorrect. When you deep-link to a page you should see the title of that page in the title bar, because that's what you would see if you were to navigate to that page using AJAX nav. This is true for both multi-page documents, and pages loaded via AJAX.

In the case of a multi-page document:

If you start navigating at http://jsbin.com/omacox/236/ and you click on the link that takes you to #page2, the title will be set to the title of page 2. However, if you start navigating like this: http://jsbin.com/omacox/236/#page2, the title will be set to the doucment title. Not only that, but if you AJAX nav to page 1 and then back, it's still set to the document title.

So, in one case, the title associated with page 2 is the document title, and in the other case it's the page title. IMO this is inconsistent.

The same thing happens when you deep-link to a page that is to be loaded via AJAX (also illustrated above by @yuripave):

http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/selects/custom.html#/test/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html

If you open that link, you will see the dialogs page, but the window title will be that of the custom select documentation page. This is terrible!

IMO, the title-choosing process for any given page (whether it is the initial page or some subsequent page) should be as follows:
1. If the page's `<div data-role=""header"">...</div>` contains a title, use it.
2. Otherwise, if the document has a title, use that.
3. Otherwise, the title is undefined.

IINM, this is pretty much a revert of the [patch](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/f81888c4e14c166ece407855045b7e9b8908e5b3) that was supposed to fix this issue - and which did fix it as originally stated, thereby introducing the above-described inconsistency.

Let's remember that it is up to the user to provide sane titles for both the document and for the individual pages, but it is up to us to display a page consistently under all circumstances. IMO, we're not doing that right now.

So I took a quick peak ... the vmousedown is firing but I'm not seeing touchmove or touchend fire, which means the expected vmouseup and vclick won't fire either. Are you guys calling preventDefault() on the touchstart event in one of your event handlers?
",jblas,yellekelyk

Thanks for looking.  I'm not entirely sure about the loading issue (I see it myself from time to time...) but refreshing tends to fix it.  The app is usually deployed with PhoneGap and isn't intended for pure web use, so I'm not too concerned with that right now.

Are you sure vmouseup isn't firing?  I am also binding to vmousedown and vmouseup on those helmets.  vmousedown causes the rectangle around the helmet to be drawn, vmouseup clears it, and vclick is supposed to load another page.  For me, the rectangle appears and disappears when clicking, so I assumed vmousedown and vmouseup were working properly.
I'm not calling preventDefault on either vmousedown or vmouseup (but I am on vclick...).

Using these clues, I tried to create a more directed example to mirror what I'm doing.
http://jsbin.com/omirod/35/edit#source
It seems that calling alert() in the vmousedown handler prevents both vmouseup and vclick from firing (but if the alert is not there, everything seems to work).  This suggests a timing-related issue, correct? (related to the time that the vmousedown handler takes).  This latest example on jsbin fails on my desktop browser and phone, so it might be a better place to focus.

When jQuery Mobile comes across ""#somePage?someId=1"" it passes it to jQuery core, which seems to interpret that as ""#somePage"" so it locates the internal page div, but then it tags it with a data-url of ""#somePage?someId=1"", which is why subsequent calls to ""#somePage?someId=2"" find the same div. The reason why it always displays ""#somePage?someId=1"" is because jQuery Mobile uses the data-url on the div which only gets set once.

I've seen enough of these internal page param requests that I went and wrote a plugin for folks. You can find it here:

https://github.com/jblas/jquery-mobile-plugins/tree/master/page-params

You can take it, modify it, and bend it to your will. There was also a similar discussion in issue #450 where someone else ended up writing a different plugin for use with backbone.js:

My version is just the barebones necessary to get this to work.

If an embedded page can't be found _after_ the first page load currently we load the first page which has caused some confusion among developers (ie, it should raise an error when loading an embedded page that doesn't exist in the same way it does with a page loaded via ajax). In thinking about this it seems that when a deeplinked embedded page doesn't exist we would have to do one of three things:
1. leave the hash in place and render the home page, which completely misrepresents the content for that hash and now the home page has two possible references (sans hash, and whatever the deeplinked hash is)
2. change the hash to be the root (ie remove it) which then creates another history entry so users could end up in a bizarre loops if they go back past the hash redirected home page
3. refresh the browser completely when the embedded page doesn't exist, which is just terrible, though I seems like you could implement this yourself as a workaround in the meantime.

Thanks for the pull request. A couple quick notes:
1. It's best to split up the changeset into multiple commits eg, library changes, tests, doc additions. That way history traversal/viewing/manipulation is easier down the road.
2. This looks super nice, but this is the kind of thing the we might delegate to a plugin since it's hard to be in the business of knowing all, or even the best subset, of ways in which people will autodivide their listviews. I don't have the final word on this though so the team will have to discuss it.
3. If we merge this in it'll be post 1.0. So I'm going to close this for now, and I've added it to the top of our listview feature request set.

At a quick glance this does appear useful though and it's built in such a way that people should be able to drop this into their applications pretty easily. Have you considered blogging about this or posting it to the jquery plugins page?

Which requires specific HTTP header replies to work. Changing the value jQuery.support.cors value manually allows jQuery to always load a given URL, bypassing the cross-domain checks.

live/pagecreate handles 1:m (with only one menu item and one list).  But if

Before I address this issue I want to point out that it would be helpful to minimize the sample you provide. By boiling down the problem to the minimum code/markup required to reproduce the issue (ie removing all the custom code that you've added) you'll help us and it often highlights where the problem is.

Your first issue, that is where the elements are not being enhanced when you return to the page a second time, is a result of reapplying the templated markup each time the initial page transitions to one of the other embedded pages. If this was an externally loaded page it would be reaped and re-enhanced which may be the source of your confusion. In this case you'll want to trigger a 'create' event on the second page or a child element once after you've replaced the markup.



Though it appears as though you've created a single item listview where the only list element contains all of the checkboxes. In any case, the above as a replacement for 



might serve as a solution to your problem. 

As for your second issue I'm not clear on what you meant by ""Note the all the CSS is lost"". When I refresh the browser after moving to either of the secondary pages, the page appears to be enhanced properly. 
",johnbender,samdz
2824,2011-11-08 06:41:16,"@samdz

I should also mention that if you want to save a few cycles and you are aware of the widgets that you'll be creating when you change pages (they all appear to be checkboxes) you can explicitly call the widget method on each of the newly created items.

2814,2012-05-29 14:43:05,"@jshepler - I agree with that. That's what I meant by using it with data-role=""none"".

If you have a single page template, it will use the title tag.

If you have a unique case and you want to have the same title for each page in a multi-page setup, simply add the data-title to each page container and the set the title the same.

The two pages http://mnstr.org/foo/page1.html?a and http://mnstr.org/foo/page1.html?b, are different as far as JQM is concerned. They _have_ to be different. We can't assume that they are the same page or have similar content. 

What this means for your sample is that the original document (http://mnstr.org/foo/page1.html?a) contains a `div#somediv` that is duplicated in the content returned form the second link click (http://mnstr.org/foo/page1.html?b).

There's nothing to be done if it's the first page (always retained though we want to address this post 1.0) or you use `domCache=true` anywhere that might duplicate id's. Otherwise the pages are reaped by default to prevent bloat and the problem won't affect you. Without knowing more about your use case I can't really suggest a solution, but it will start with not using id's on elements that are duplicated in the DOM by ajax requests to the same url, understanding that's now always easy.

I'm suggesting that if you are going to re-use the same url with different query params where any of the requests to said url are the home page or you have domCaching turned on then you need to select on something other than an id. Even better in those cases don't use id's. 

I'm not at all suggesting that every page has to worry about uniqueness, although you should certainly make sure that separate pages don't have overlapping id's in any case since they are being loaded into the DOM together.

Yeah animations would be cool.

One thing is, what color will the ""canvas"" behind the dialog will have.
Because the parent page is hidden, it will be white, i think. Not always nice..

And may another suggestion: Adding a directive for ""non-native-select-full-size-dialogs""
like _data-list-maxwidth_ for a selectmenu. If set to auto or null, the framework set the
max-width, if set to a px- or %-value, the author determine the width.

I tested this specifically with jquery mobile and major browsers (IE8... firefox, chrome, i haven't tried ie7).  The only requirement is for the textarea to have a min-height set in css.

The code minified is 1.5kb and gzipped 691 bytes.  

To minimize performance impact while typing I used the same buffer,100 milliseconds with setTimeout clearTimeout, as what jqm currently is using to fire the auto grow on textarea, it will fire only every 100 millisecs.

Hope it helps.

to use with jqm, first the current jqm textarea events need to be removed:

When @tommedema said ""When you register a button with .button() inside a listview, it will somehow cause all clicks in the center to fail."", I didn't realize this is just a link in a list item instead of a true button or input submit element.

First off, links with a data-role of button just allows a link to have  the button visual appearance of a button but since it's not a form element, addressing this via .button() isn't going to work.

Next, since links can't be disabled in HTML, the framework doesn't support disabling link based buttons. I recently made a comment about this on the forms page under ""Disabling form elements"" and if you want to disable a link ""button"" you need to tack on the disabled class yourself - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/docs-forms.html

Lastly, having a link inside a listitem in a listview widget is exactly the markup that the framework expects for a normal listview item. I'm pleasantly surprised that the data-role=""button"" is making this look ok in this scenario, but I can see this being so close to the listview markup pattern that there could be problems.

It's fixed by adding a new toolbar widget, that will land in 1.4 (alpha release in two weeks). So this is not a small/simple fix that you can apply in current or previous versions.

What you can do now is enhance the header yourself. Check which classes are added by the framework if the header would already be in place (`ui-header`, `ui-bar-*` theme class, etc.) and add those classes to the markup that you inject. You also have to add class `ui-title` to the heading inside your header. If you have buttons inside your header you can add class `ui-btn-left|right` to position them.
",jaspermdegroot,mgmarino
2702,2012-07-16 13:57:38,"At the moment the listview widget adds the corner classes none of the list items are visible yet. That's why we can't filter visible LI's.

It does check for a class of `ui-screen-hidden` though. This class is used for hiding list items when you use the list filter feature. So this works: http://jsfiddle.net/WzUPu/12/

I suggest to fix this issue by adding a note at the bottom of the ""List basics & API"" page about using this class if you want to hide a list element. @agcolom @toddparker do you agree?

Turns out we were calculating the transition to use _AFTER_ we created a history entry, so only explicit transitions were being recorded. I simply moved the calculation code before the history entry and things work properly now..

2692,2011-10-19 20:30:27,"@toddparker - If providing a test page for iOS-specific features, the following meta and link tags should be included.  And, as [mentioned](#issuecomment-2400526) above, `addBackBtn` should be set to `true` so the user can navigate.



ios_icon.png should be 57x57, ios_startup.png should be 320x460 (portrait orientation).  [Documentation here](http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html).

(Note: I don't think the `apple-touch-fullscreen` meta tag is necessary, just `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`.)

This would be a great option for iOS users to browse the docs without the Safari chrome.  I could try creating the test page if you want.

2692,2011-10-20 21:17:05,"@toddparker, I was also wondering whether the Back link and the home icon/link are not too close to each other. You might argue that people actually getting the doc in full-screen would be capable of distinguishing between the 2 (and familiar with their difference). For example, I initially thought they made one single component. However, after trying both, I realised that they were 2 different components (one back, one home), so I am not too worried about that. 

If you change the link colour, you may want to also change the alink colour as well :-) 

Final point: The icon works really well.

It may be related to PhoneGap. I'm not sure whether it is just PhoneGap though, or the combination of PhoneGap and jQuery mobile.

Update: when running this fiddle together with Ripple (PhoneGap emulator) in the browser, the issue does not appear. I suspect this is because it runs with a normal PC keyboard: thus the on-screen virtual keyboard does not need to appear.

This makes me believe even more this is related to the virtual keyboard and resulting screen height changes. Then again, it does not appear in the jsfiddle with a virtual keyboard.

This may be caused by PhoneGap, which is awkward, since all it does is create a browser instance.

- removing footer and header does not influence the issue (they were also inline)
- I cannot run the app in a WebView without phonegap.js, but when running it in the normal browser without phonegap, the issue does not appear
- I would say it is more likely that it is not phonegap that causes it, but rather how Android renders webviews inside native applications.

So the strange thing is that transition rules are only a factor during the transitions. Once the new page is showing, all transition related classes are removed, so the rules with the transforms, etc mentioned above are not in play at the time you would be clicking into a textfield on a given page.

The one thing I can see that both the transition and collapsible rules in question have are negative positionings/renderings to the left of the document. I'd be curious if we could factor out jQuery Mobile from this equation and create a plain vanilla HTML file with a similar negative offset rule applied and see if it happens. If so, then we need to report the bug to the Android folks as well as the PhoneGap folks.

We currently do not support loading of arbitrary pages in an external document. That is, when you load an external document, we only extract the first page from it. The recommended approach for jQuery Mobile 1.0 is to add data-ajax=""false"" or rel=""external"" to the link that attempts to load y.html#Z. You can read more about it here:

I'm ok with delaying for post 1.0, as long as Theme Roller follows suit, but I really don't think this is an enhancement request, so I prefer it stays as an issue.

Relying on 2 different themes makes it harder for our users, who understand CSS, to style when they can't reliably tell what theme a component is using without looking at the code _OR_ opening up the developer tools of the browser to see what the run-time DOM looks like.

2658,2012-07-16 11:37:27,"@toddparker 

I think the getInheritedTheme function didn't exists yet when this issue was opened.

See the overview below. Where you see ""swatch C as fallback"" it is only used if no container with a body/bar swatch can be found. This basically means, only if the theme option for ""page"" has been set to something else than [a-z].
We could change it to A, but there is not really a need to do this (I am closing this ticket).

I suggest to add a small overview to the ""Theme Framework"" page that shows for what element a default swatch has been set in options. A checklist of what you might have to configure if you use a custom theme.

Overview - this applies if you haven't specified a swatch:
- page: swatch C as default in options
- content: inherits by default
- form elements & buttonMarkup: inherits, swatch C as fallback
- collapsible: inherits, swatch C as fallback
- listviews: inherits, swatch C as fallback
  - dividers: swatch B as default in options
  - nested list headers: swatch B as default in options
  - split theme: swatch B as default in options
  - count bubble: swatch C as default in options
- error message: swatch E as default for option pageLoadErrorMessageTheme
- loader: swatch A as default in options
- header & footer: swatch A as default in options
- navbar: inherits

Issues that I will look into:
- select: the count bubble for multi-selects always uses swatch C
- popup: getInheritedTheme doesn't work correctly

Why FF 7.0.1 is the only browser that's raising this issue?
A position of _absolute_ says, the element stays _above_ the others and do not affect other elements.
But, its position is relative to the borders of the parent, if the parent has a positioning too.
""Our"" parent is the header of the collapsible and it is positioned relative.
So the ""hidden"" collapsible-heading-status-span is -9999px left _inside_ its parent span,

Thanks for filing this ... it just points out that we really do need to handle the case where a page we are pulling in can have a base tag of its own specified. We're not handling that specific case right now, so all hrefs/src attributes get resolved against the document url used to load the page.

I believe we'd have to transmit the intent for the page to be a dialog along with the request to support this and there's a danger there of mucking up a server request (reads: we won't be doing that). If you have access to the document where the page is defined you can give it the requisite `data-role` to render it as a dialog.

It seems like that assumption was made before the relative path changes went in. Shouldn't we prefer the pathname + search? I confess I'm getting to the point where I feel like its extremely hard to keep all the implications straight in my mind. 
",johnbender,jblas
2644,2011-10-08 04:03:17,"@jblas

Clarification: If the hash was a path here, the pushstate plugin would reconcile it with the current url and remove the hash altogether. Because the hash isn't a path it leaves it.

This is why I linked to where we set the data-url.
",johnbender,jblas
2644,2011-10-09 02:15:02,"@johnbender

For consistency sake I think it needs to remain an id ... we already have a utility function that can figure out if it is the first page or not based on id, document URL, or base URL ... what puzzles me is why this is the only case where we are getting the hash wrong? I haven't actually debugged it yet to figure out if this is a nav problem or a pushstate problem.
",jblas,johnbender
2644,2011-10-10 06:13:02,"@johnbender

I haven't actually debugged this because I'm on an iPad at the moment, but looking at the onhashchange callback:

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.pushstate.js#L75

It seems to assume that it can just resolve an id hash against the current location.href when it should be resolving against the $.mobile.documentUrl.

You mentioned in your post that you don't see pageinit fired ... for which page, and when? I ask because the first-page of the application document is only ever created once. It is never pruned from the DOM so when you go to the first-page, we are really just showing you what is in the DOM already, so no pageinit ever occurs for the first-page after the initial application document load.

Two quick notes: 
1. It will always be easier for us to address your issue if you provide a working sample via jsbin of jsfiddle. In this case I've created one myself: http://jsbin.com/osigow/4
2. The documentation specifically states the a page loaded via ajax will only select the _first_ `data-role=page` element to load into the: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0rc1/docs/pages/page-navmodel.html (Third paragraph from the top). The link in your second page expects that _both_ `data-role=page` elements will be loaded and that the second will be ""linkable"". Please consult the documentation before filling a bug. 

As to why its loading the original page on click and not displaying an error, we'll address that as a separate [bug](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2643)

You can try http://jsfiddle.net/agcolom/AYZNd/7/show and press the submit button. It should tell you whether the switch is on 'yes' or 'no'.

@toddparker

Looking at the sample, and watching the page/popstate/hashchange events,  it looks as if it may be a popstate implementation bug. I can actually reproduce the bug in desktop Safari 5.0.5 (Windows).

When Safari loads page2, a popstate event is actually fired by the browser, but the event object it passes has the state object for the previous page (index) .

As far as I know popstate should not be fired when navigating to a new document.

I need to check if the scripts in the body are contributing to this weird behavior.

Ok, seeing your source first-hand really helped. I think what's going on is this ... your script tags are included at the very end of the body in your file. Your body contains _NO_ data-role=""page"" div in it so the framework is using:



to wrap _ALL_ of the content in the body ... this has the side effect of triggering some jQuery core code that re-writes the script tags into the HEAD of your document, with the current time appended to it as a query param.

You can get around all this by simply making sure that there is at least one div with data-role=""page"" in your body ... perhaps around your maps div.

2596,2011-10-27 01:24:42,"@jblas Thanks for info, I will put any new issues in new tickets then. Just to clarify: the problem is not that the footer disappears in the beginning, but that it does not reappear in general in so many cases, i.e. when releasing any touch or scroll.
For example, another case is that I have a screen that's not actually scrollable, but where I have a background image larger than the screen, but with css attribute: #splashPage {height:100%;overflow:hidden;} and some content elements that go beyond the screen height (which is fine, I just want to ensure that the entire screen is filled).
With that, I can just touch the screen anywhere (doesn't even scroll due to the overflow style), and the footer disappears without even re-appearing(!) again after releasing the touch and waiting for a while.

As a workaround I now use a plugin for the footer, which appears to make the behaviour more stable, as it's demoed here: http://yappo.github.com/projects/jquery.mobile.iscroll/livedemo.html 
It's exactly the same behaviour as the default jqm footer, it hides the footer when user touches the screen or scrolls (which is fine), but the footer does re-appear (!) again, that's the main point I want to point out here actually.

I believe this is very important because asp.net is not an obscure language, and this problem not only affects those devs, but anyone who places a simple change/click/focus/blur event on a control.

As much as i don't like the code classic .net generates with controls, you are completely right that there is a bug in jqm:
_Click events bound on form elements are not carried over to their styled counterparts._

Here's a fiddle, no .net in sight, but broken nonetheless:
http://jsfiddle.net/itechnology/48mC9/3/

I'd still suggest that if your using asp.net 4, you set `clientIDMode=""Static""` on the `system.web/pages` tag in web.config, this will stop .net from generating crazy id's like `id=""ctl00_C_T_ctl01_ctl00_ctl00_myCbx""`, instead you will end up with `id=""myCbx""`, which is way easier to target in css/javascript than wild-guessing what .net will generate

2546,2011-09-27 18:49:43,"Hi @laustdeleuran

What version of jQuery Mobile are you guys using? For the record, we don't modify links, we modify the location hash for the browser after we've loaded external pages. When we load files via XHR, we are actually using normal URL paths. If the path contained in the link's href is a relative path, that path gets resolved against the source URL for the page that contains the link.

The reason I ask what version you guys are using is because the hash reference to an external page should be a site relative path. The example given above, and in the forum post:

index.html#page1.html

shouldn't be possible with the beta and newer versions of the framework. We moved to using site relative references because the framework sometimes could not distinguish between a file in the same directory as the application and an  id.

It might help if you or @vanthemaniac could give us an example of an application manifest listing the files involved, and then an example of the link markup that doesn't work. Also notating what file contains the link that doesn't work would help.

This is sub-optimal but the best solution we can offer for now if that is indeed the problem. Post back here if the information in that thread isn't of value.

I don't mean to sound prickly but I think we'd prefer that you posted here to the issue tracker before posting to your blog publicly to verify that it is in fact a jquery mobile bug. I'm betting in this case it's not.

This is a good idea, but I'm worried that the `base` variable, and subsequently, `$.mobile.base` are two very different types in the patch depending on the `rewriteBase` attribute. That is, if it's enabled `base` is a singleton object and if it's not `base` is a string. It seems like this will likely be a source of bugs down the road. 

I still need to take a closer look to see what's involved, but the idea is a good one and something I think we should support.

1.Docs link you have send is of beta3. With this there is flicker on page transition(it is not smooth). So I have used a4 and Transition effect is smooth with that.
2.I have js file where all my javascript logic is placed. Since ajax donot read anything inside head tag so I can't include it in head section, for sure. As directed in docs, I included all js, style sheets etc which were earlier in head section but no success in pagecreate event handler as below:-

$(""#agriculture"").live('pagecreate',function(event){



Transition effect is fine now but no javascript is executed on next page.

Actually, I have some images on that next page. When user clicks on the desired image, javascipt file checks which image is clicked(using the id of image tag) and therefore, fetch result from database.
But since no javascript is executing, nothing can be done.
I see an error on console ""Failed to load webpage with error: Frame load interrupted"".
I'm newbie to mobile jquery, so please guide what should I do further to execute my general.js file.
I have even tried to put the whole .js content inside pagecreate event but no success.

The main issue with allowing transitioning to the same page is the actual transition animations themselves. They usually require 2 different elements to operate on. That said, we were thinking of disabling the same page check in changePage() via a config option, whose default could be tweaked to turn off. The caveat would be that you would be responsible for either turning off transitions when going to the same page or defining your own transition that makes sense.
",jblas,gemehendrix
2529,2011-09-26 16:49:40,"Well that sounds reasonable. Although it's difficult to appreciate without a
code example.

Currently my software team is having to create new DOM elements instead of
just reloading the current page which is a pain. Here's some more
information on our use case...
- Our JS is completely dynamic in nature.
- Our JS plugs directly into the jQuery Mobile events (i.e. pageshow,
  pagehide etc). It's nice because in our JS, we have a JS Object per page
  that has associated event handlers on it.
- It's really cool to pass 'parameters' for a page (that's contained in the
  URL) into the associated page JS Object. As shown in your example, we parse
  the parameters out on the pagebeforechange event and then create the page.

If you'd like an example of our approach, let me know and I can provide a
more detailed use case on our approach.

So it seems I can reproduce this problem with Windows Safari 5.0.5 (Desktop). What seems to be happening is that Safari is actually loading the homepage.html external link as an external document (as it should), but then it goes and fires a popstate event that contains some state object data from the previous document.

We're actually adding some more information to the docs as we speak, but the short story is that some browser implementations (including desktop browsers) implement the `popstate` event differently when linking externally and moving back to a page onto which state has already been pushed/replaced. 

The reason the plugin is enabled by default is that hash navigation is fundamentally flawed in that using the hash we're dependent on javascript when the page isn't embedded which is inherently unreliable.

Yes, setting domCache = true globally works as advertised: pages remain in cache. However, since my apps have dynamic content on every page, I need a method to invalidate that content so that it will be reloaded whenever the page is viewed. If I remove pages from the cache myself, back / forward navigation can lead to blank pages.

Thanks for confirming my findings. I would still consider it more of an issue than a feature request because it is not how I would expect the domCache option to work. I understand that much of the reasoning behind introducing this option is to keep memory usage down. However, another reason to use this option is to control the caching of pages, which is vital to any app with dynamic content. Even if you'd like to keep domCache working as is, I strongly feel that there should be some way to invalidate pages to force content to be reloaded.

Thanks for hearing me out! I'm certainly willing to pitch in to help once a consensus emerges on the proper approach.

Yes, setting domCache = true globally works as advertised: pages remain in cache. However, since my apps have dynamic content on every page, I need a method to invalidate that content so that it will be reloaded whenever the page is viewed. If I remove pages from the cache myself, back / forward navigation can lead to blank pages.

> In Alpha4, I could remove pages from the DOM when they were hidden, but this approach now screws up the history and back / forward navigation.

When we disable `domCache` globally it should behave in the same fashion it did prior to its inclusion in the library, which means that's a bug. Also, if we can get that working you'll at least have a workaround.

Thanks for the clarification. I agree that the inability to cleanly remove cached pages is a separate issue from the ""sticky"" initial page when caching is disabled. Maybe they should be separated in Github. A fix to either issue would be most appreciated and allow me to upgrade my apps.

Although I said that the removal of cached pages on pagehide hasn't worked since Alpha4, I verified that it also works in Beta1 (but hasn't worked since then). I've tried simply removing pages from the DOM and also manipulating the $.mobile.urlHistory.stack without success.

I see why it's happening. You are removing the first-page of the application document, which the framework always assumes will be available. In fact it tracks it because of special path circumstances, and this specific check was made to prevent duplication of the first-page by accident. I suppose that I can check to see if $.mobile.firstPage has a parentNode before resetting the page being loaded.

No, it does not include pruning embedded pages. The main reason we cannot do this is because we don't have the ability to load random pages from external documents. We only load the first page of external documents. This is fine for your case, because your document only contains one page, but there are lots of folks using app documents that have more than one embedded page (for the commonly used pages) and pull in external pages that need to be more dynamic or are less-used.

@ahutch

Regarding your issue of wanting to conditionally prune, the framework fires off a 'pageremove' event just before it attempts to remove the page from the DOM. If you call preventDefault() on that event, the page will be left in the DOM. This allows you to control whether a page gets pruned whenever it gets hidden.

2520,2011-11-04 20:39:03,"Thanks very much for the fix @jblas. I've confirmed that selective caching of pages is now possible, regardless of whether pages have been embedded. I created a new branch to my test project to illustrate how selective caching can be done:

https://github.com/dgeb/jquery-mobile-test/tree/jqm1.0_latest_with_selective_caching

In this sample, you can set data-dom-cache=""true"" on individual pages to force them to be cached. All others will be removed by a pageshow event handler like this:



For the record, I still don't understand the special status being given to embedded pages. Even if multiple pages are embedded in the initially loaded page, they could be subject to the same rules of dom caching as external pages if marked with data-dom-cache=""true"". This would negate the need for custom code (like my example) to override the default (and IMO unexpected) caching behavior.

The jQM framework will ignore link clicks when the link has rel=""external"" or data-ajax=""false"" on it. It's documented here:

Hi,
here's the markup that's generated

This:



Generates this:



_(well ..one can just write the markup out by hand too)_

The only thing that changes is either data-ajax will be true or false, the rest of the markup stays the same.

If data-ajax is true, jqm will try to load a non existent page (since the partial code does not contain any page role), and if data-ajax is set to false, jqm will navigate away from the page, which is pretty logical, since it's a href after all.

Here's some doc on jQuery unobtrusive, which is pretty much the default now in MVC3:
http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2010/10/mvc3-unobtrusive-ajax.html

From what i heard, the next version of Visual Studio & MVC4 will even be shipping with JQM

Would be nice if there was a solution, maybe something similar to data-ajax=[true|false|custom]

For now i am using this:



I actually have to pass the parameter via the url, otherwise i wasn't able to produce this behavior on a per/link basis.

Have you tried namespacing your jQM data attributes?

""If data-ajax is true, jqm will try to load a non existent page (since the partial code does not contain any page role), and if data-ajax is set to false, jqm will navigate away from the page, which is pretty logical, since it's a href after all.""

Even if that doesn't fix the issue (since I have no idea how their javascript works and where its loaded in relation to jqm) it looks like the `data-*` attributes that are being generated will be in conflict with those used by jQM anyway.



With that jQM will ignore the ""data-ajax"", and expect ""data-your-super-cool-ns-ajax"" along with any other jQM attributes. 

Out of curiosity do the MVC guys provide a data attr namespace option for their helpers? I have no experience with MVC.

2514,2011-09-27 23:41:29,"@toddparker

Np, the solution i posted above works perfectly fine for me. So i'm happy with that for now :)

I do have a suggestion for a solution though, so here goes:
- JQM introduces a third parameter to data-ajax: data-ajax=[true|false|custom]
  - This would permit short-circuiting jqm's link handling behavior like jblas mentioned above
  - If set to custom, jqm just ignores all handling, and expects third party handling
  - This would permit one to set the behavior on a per/link, per/form basis
- Microsoft moves their data-ajax-true namespace to data-ajax-enabeled=true for example
  - This would involve updating their server-side AjaxHelpers & their client-side jquery.unobtrusive.js 

Now when AjaxHelpers are used outside of a jqm environment, regular syntax will simply apply, and when used inside a jqm environment, one would just need to supply it with an additional parameter to render an extra attribute of data-ajax=custom

Thank's again,
Robert

Note that when you preventDefault() on the pageloadfailed event, you need to make sure you call resolve/reject on the deferred object so that the framework can continue on it's normal flow. Example:



The reason I don't handle that for you is because the developer may want to load something else when they get a failure, in which case they would call data.deferred.resolve(data.absUrl, data.options) to signal success instead of a fail.

Allow me some short words about selectmenus:
To use long non-native selects is always a fight with the occurring page events if they used at the parent...
And, as it seems, they are a problem with the dom management too.
Excuse me if i talk about iOS now, but the native select on ipad shows a nice to use 
scrollable canvas and not a full screen-page, if the selectlist is long.
A long option-list is most often not a wide one. And if, just the font-size is scaled down.
Why the team not just make the small-non-native-select to a long, scrollable select,
if more options inside than educible
And, this would be the icing on the cake and would hit the iOS select, an integrated, switchable search on the top.

I looked at your test page. Things are acting as they are supposed to. The way it works is:
- Pages embedded within the main application document all have their @data-url set to the id of the @data-role=""page"" element. The only exception to this is the first-page in the document. The first-page is special because it can be addressed by its @id if it has one, or by the document or base URL (with no hash fragment).
- Pages that are external to the application document get pulled in dynamically via ajax, their data-url is set to the site relative path to the external page. If you are running in an environment where loading an external page from a different domain is allowed, then the data-url is set to the absolute URL.

That all said, I will confirm that the external page with an @id works as described above. If so, then this is a non-bug. Or am I missing something?

Here is a test page using latest code, with `hidePlaceholderMenuItems` set to `false`: http://jsbin.com/enetay/20

It doesn't hide the menu item that is used as placeholder, so if you just look at the name of the option it does exactly what you would expect. However, the docs say that setting this option to `false` disables the feature and you wouldn't expect the framework to add a header to the menu. Question is what is the desired behaviour here.

Besides that, the focus is on the wrong menu item when the placeholder isn't hidden.

",johnbender,smackie604
2452,2011-09-15 18:42:40,"Hi @johnbender,

The main problem we are running into with data-dom-cache=""true"" is the framework we are running on our backend to generate our markup.  When the form is submitted with errors, the same page is returned, except with our error messages in the dom.  The problem is now the error page and the original form page are in the dom, both with the same id's on all the elements, this has been causing various problems for us.

Another problem is that we have fairly complex caching requirements, and having to manage the dom ""by hand"" has proven to be quite challenging in some scenarios, like nested list pages.  The browser cache solution is much cleaner for us, and currently is working perfectly except this one problem.

Also, we have a fairly large set of pages we need cached, some of them may have large lists of data.  One our of business requirements unfortunately is to implement a pseudo fixed header with iScroll.  To have a decent scrolling speed, some of our dom elements have to be added to the hardware acceleration layer as described here: http://cubiq.org/you-shall-not-flicker.  I fear having all these different pages with these elements in the dom at once may cause problems.

Thanks!

2452,2011-09-16 07:45:13,"@smackie604,

I guess I'm a little confused about the scenario you're trying to support with the original issue. I thought it was just that submitting a form and then hitting the back button didn't retain the values that were in the form because it was reaped by our dom cache removal. What you've described though sounds like you do in fact want the page to be removed otherwise it colides with the new page thats rendered if the form has been submitted with invalid data.

As a side note the only change that the proposed fix makes is the directionality of the css transition :(

Sorry if I'm being slow here, maybe a step by step use case would help me out? Thanks for your patience. 
",johnbender,smackie604
2452,2011-09-16 18:46:33,"The scenario I am trying to support is the same behavior of the back button as if the page wasn't enhanced by JQuery Mobile.  The form is submitted, you hit back button, and the data is there.  I wanted to achieve this without the use of the dom cache, for the reasons I listed above.

I now see the fix doesn't solve my issue, I applied the fix incorrectly.  I had ""reverse:  reverse"" as an option without setting it above the function call... the result seems to be that it breaks the AJAX request and falls back on a non ajax form submit, and because the form submit wasn't via ajax, the back button preserves the form data.

So I guess the solution for me, if it can't be done via ajax, is to set data-ajax=""false"" on my form.  It would be nice to have to have the ajax transition back with the data preserved without using dom cache, but I don't know if it's technically possible.

Should we preserve pages that we navigate away from on form submission?

A common solution to this problem is this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post/Redirect/Get

In most cases you never want the user to refresh the page and cause the form submission to happen again.  In a non-ajax form submit the browser will always warn you if you are trying to do this.
",smackie604,evadell
2452,2012-05-25 19:40:23,"Hi @johnbender,

I just ran into this issue of the form submit and back buttons as well. What happens is after the form submit, the back button goes back to the same form. The reason for this is jQueryMobile uses .changePage() for the submits and the entry is placed into the $.mobile.urlHistory : this basically duplicates entries for the form every time you submit. 

If you change the .changePage() on form submit by adding changeHash : false ; the back button works correctly.

I believe, changeHash : false is a correct way of handling this, at least on ""POST""s anyways, as you don't want people to navigate back to the POSTed pages.

Version: Beta 3
Multi-page / external pages: No, none whatsoever. Every page is its own page and is not external.
""Back"" from an embedded page: I'm not sure what you mean by this.
Example?: The only example of it is in the staging version of a site that I'm building for a client. We're releasing it in a few days, so I don't think he'd mind me sharing, but the only pages that do it you need an account to access. If it's absolutely necessary, I can reproduce the issue on a public page and I'll post steps tomorrow to reproduce.

I see the loading spinner, so surely the events are fireing and changePage() is getting called. It spins for a couple of seconds, and then just dies with no change of page happening.

I just tried wrapping my tryLoad() function in a setTimeout() with a delay of 3 seconds, and the result is just the same. So it doesn't seem to be a race condition.

Ok, I managed to get phonegap 1.1.0 all setup and tested your sample code within an app I built myself. At first I was seeing a page load failure. After some investigation into what the exact error was, it turns out that the XHR object was reporting a ""White list rejection"" error. After some research, it looks like PhoneGap introduced the notion of a whitelist to help limit the extent of an XSS attack. To enable cross domain loads now, you need to add the domain you want your app to be able to access. To do this, you need to open the Phonegap.plist file and add your domain in the External Hosts section. So for example, your app was trying to load http://jquerymobile.com, you would list jquerymobile.com under External Hosts.

After doing, this, I rebuilt the app, and your untouched source was able to load the jquerymobile.com site with no problems.

Actually, above test was with PhoneGap 1.1.0. The PhoneGap upgrade didn't seem to affect this issue at all. I didn't have to whitelist any domains. But .plist stuff is for iOS builds I think? I'm only testing with Android here.

I then went into the source and pointed the JS and CSS to the RC1 equivalents, rebuilt and re-ran it in the emulator, and things worked fine there too.

I think we're going to close this one and leave it to devs to us `$.offset` where necessary. Our concern is around the nonstandard attributes (offsetX and Y are not supported on mozilla), and the perf impact of reflow's triggered by the loops.

I updated your patch with the following comment:

""This looks ok, but we're going to have to sync up the vclick stuff too. That is, we are marking links as active on vclick, and executing the actions on click ... they both need to check for event.which ... but, we also have to modify the vmouse events so that they generate a event.which property for touch events. Note that vmouse events that are the result of real mouse events already have 'which' properties on them.""

2433,2012-02-16 15:09:31,"@kurteknikk - agreed. Inline styles are tricky - do you move or copy them? Were they intended for the basic or enhanced widget? With a class, we can take the original class on the element (foo) and create a new class on the outermost element of the enhanced widget with a unique but predictable name (foo-enhanced) so things are clear.

2427,2011-12-13 18:03:59,"@jblas This needs to be addressed. There are a few work arounds out there that can be implemented such as providing a status code of 280 so that xmlhttprequest doesn't ignore it. This is a major issue for people that use jqm with another backend language such as PHP to store their sessions. IF the session is expired when someone tries to make a call we need to redirect to the login page. However the URL is that of the page they tried to visit which screws up the login page.

Let's try and find an alternative instead of just saying it cannot be done.

It's going to be a little extra work, but if you want to take advantage of pushstate URLs, you'll need to serve the full HTML content when the request is coming from regular HTTP rather than Ajax. I'd recommend doing this by checking the x-requested-with header to see if it's a request coming from Ajax or not, and negotiating your markup delivery based on that. 

In the end, doing this will make your site/app work on pretty much all devices, even C-Grade, or in devices where JS is not supported, available, etc.

I think this may be a bug in the implementation of pushstate/replacestate in Chrome. After reading several docs, including:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history

Specifically:

http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/history.html#history
http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/history.html#history-traversal

I'm left with the impression that the correct behavior on back(), even if the document DOM were not cached in-memory, is to reload page1 (the main application document) and then generate a popstate event with the URL for page2. That is indeed how it is implemented in Mozilla, and how they have documented it on their page at the URL above.

I think we should file an issue with the Chrome guys and see what they say.

I could clearly see in the generated markup in F12 that the icon-pos was set to top even though my inline markup set it to right.

I found a workaround which was to set icon-pos in the containing navbar rather than in the li-a, so I'm not eager to undo-redo in my code just to prove a point. However, I can tell you I'm using 1.4.1 in Chrome on Windows -- developing on local machine. Maybe it got fixed in 1.4.2?

I guess I was assuming that properties set on the parent could be overridden on the child. I only have one li-a button in my navbar, which I did as a way of fixing the button's position, beneath the header and at the top of the content, when the user scrolls down this particular page. I suppose mixing iconpos on multiple buttons -- by setting that property on the li-a instead of the parent navbar -- could create a suboptimal UI.

2370,2012-02-03 00:14:46,"Hi everyone, if this the wrong place to speak, I apologize. @toddparker, we met briefly at the jQuery Conf in Mountain View last year. Fun conference!

So as I demoed to you guys then, I've been developing a similar framework but only targeting Android2.2+, Blackberry6+, and iPhone. Even with just the best of the best, mobile web dev is extremely challenging. Kudos and big thanks to Todd and his team for doing so much even against the odds. These browsers are truly buggy.

For what I did in my app is I allow true fixed positioning only in Android. 
[data-platform=""android""] .top-toolbar {position: fixed; top:0; left: 0;}

iPhone's fixed positioning on iOS5 is buggy. To handle this, I use overflow:scroll on the main container (stuff below the toolbar, and below a bottom tab bar), and dynamically set the height of the incoming view on view change. But! overflow-scrolling-touch causes critical bugs. So currently my app doesn't have momentum scrolling on iOS5. I'm sure sure Apple is fixing that right now.

Different strategies can be deployed on different platforms to get the optimum experiences.

Android 2.2 - position fixed
iOS5 - overflow scroll
Everything else - the nice fade in/out top and bottom toolbars jQueryMobile already supplies.

If ya'll want any help, I could try to jump into the code base and see if I can figure out a scalable arch for maximizing features on different phones, if you haven't already.

Keep up the good fight jQueryMobile team. You guys are awesome.
",grandecomplex,toddparker
2370,2012-02-03 20:33:02,"@grandecomplex - Thanks for the encouragement. We already approach this in a layered way, though a bit different than you. On toolbars, we're moving away from the dynamic re-positioning completely because they tend to scroll with the page due to way mobile browsers ""freeze"" the display during scrolls and we figure it's cleaner looking to fall back to them scrolling with the page. We use position:fixed for platforms like iOS5, Android 2.2+, Playbook, BB7, Kindle Fire, etc. because it is so lightweight and allows each platform to use native scrolling which will feel ""right"". 

Using overflow:auto on iOS is almost awesome but we rand into a lot fo issues when we used this for our touchOverfow feature (now deprecated for 1.1). There were a few bugs: content wouldn't render randomly inside a scrolled container, forcing us to apply a transform to force rendering which introduces lots of off CSS flakiness; tapping the clock to scroll to top didn't work (in fact it crashed the browser a lot); and the scrolling momentum is different than normal pages. Overflow is still a good feature and we're looking at re-using a lot of this work for handling overflow regions for tablets but it seemed to introduce too many bugs to add to every page just to smooth out transitions and get fixed headers (we worked out other solutions to these issues).

Anyway, all good stuff and feel free to help us out by commenting or providing fixes via pull requests.

Ok, so I took a look at your sample. The problem seems to be that the custom select fires off the change event _BEFORE_ the select's item overlay/dialog is dismissed. It's a lttle convoluted, but what happens is this:
- your onchange handler is fired, so it calls changePage()
- changePage starts transitioning in the select-school page
- the select then triggers a window.back() to get back to the original page (select-state) that contains the select element
- The window.back() request gets queued because there is a page currently in transition.
- When the select-school page is done transitioning, the navigation code loads the next page in the queue which is the select-state page.

To fix this problem, I simply modified your onchange handler from:



to:



So the question remains as to whether or not we should fire the ""change"" notification _after_ the overlay/dialog close. I'll need to consult the W3 HTML event descriptions to see if they say anything about ordering. I would imagine that calling prevent default on a change might prevent the change on  a select from happening, but I'm not sure it would leave the native select menu up.

I'm not seeing this previous page showing for ""1 second"" problem on any of the Android devices I tested your code sample on. I do see occassional flashing right after the transition ... but that is due to wonky Android animation compositing. Is that what you're referring to?

In this case it's hard to make a recommendation without knowing exactly what you're doing inside the bound function, but we re-execute the scripts on each pageload and that's not likely to change. That is, we have to execute the scripts on each page load.

If you already know the page element id why not do the live binding outside of the page itself as recommended under the `pagecreate` section in the [docs](http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b2/#/demos/1.0b2/docs/api/events.html)? 

I'm going to close this issue but maybe we can work together to figure out a better way to keep your code page specific without the `live` binding.
",johnbender,kirk911
2368,2011-09-02 19:10:05,"@kirk911

Each time the page `#bar` is loaded the this code is executed:



That means its creating a _new_ live binding each time the page is loaded. Load the page 4 times and you've bound to the `pagecreate` for `#bar` 4 times. The binding exists in the global context of the html document and is not localized to the html of the page div that you're loading it in.

Hopefully that makes it clearer.

Perhaps what we need is to have an event that fires when a page is about to be purged. That way developers can clean up this type of stuff if need be.
",jblas,johnbender
2368,2011-09-02 20:23:02,"@kirk911

For what it's worth, instead of using a live() function, which registers the handler on the document itself, which is why the old event handler lives past the removal of the original #next element ... perhaps you can do something like:

$(""#next"").bind(""pagecreate"", function(){ console.log( ""called!"" ); });

That way, when the #next element disappears, so does its event handler.

Thank you very much for your prompt and detailed response.

I'll follow up on the information you've given me.

To try and help you understand my project and use cases better, let me state
my use case a bit more clearly...
- I'm very proficient in JavaScript now but I'm not a Web Developer. My
  background is Application developing in Java. Regardless, I've found by
  following the way of Crockford, using JsLint and lots of unit tests that
  creating Open Web Apps is perfectly feasible and lots of fun.
- The Web Apps I'm developing are JavaScript based. Therefore, most of the
  content in the App is generated on the fly in the client rather than on the
  Server. I think you'll find this more and more common going forward.
  Although I'd like to hear your opinion on this.
- The Apps consist of many different 'pages'. In my alarm app, I've got
  about 6 different pages the user can navigate between.
- I've found the best way to plug my JavaScript into my Web App is by
  responding to jQuery Mobile's events rather than hard coding HREFs with
  'javascript:runSomeJsCodeAndChangeThePage' in. In fact, I've created a
  little framework called 'Pages' that allows a developer to associate a
  jQuery Mobile 'page' with a JavaScript Object. The JavaScript Object
  contains methods (i.e. pageshow) that if present will be invoked. It's nice
  because I have a JavaScript object that I can plug methods
  and behaviour into.
- In the Apps I'm currently creating, it's nice to have some state
  maintained if the user refreshes the web page. For some of this we're using
  HTML5 Web Storage. However, for our use cases it would be nice to have the
  URL updated as well. We tried using an HTML 5 feature to update the address
  bar but there's not very good support. Hence my original post.
- I'm still finding it a bit difficult to use jQuery Mobile for dynamically
  generated content. For instance, I had to give up on dynamically creating a
  radio button list the other day. Have you tried this? I see the jQuery
  Mobile team is putting more effort into dynamically generated content but I
  think there's still more work to be done here.

So far the team I'm in has been able to produce some really nice looking
Mobile Apps using jQuery Mobile so I'd like to thank you all for your
efforts. Going forward, I'll try to encourage the company I work for to
provide some sponsorship money for this worthwhile project.

Best regards,
Geme

I'll need some clarification around your issue. Could you possibly include [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net) or [jsbin](http://jsbin.com) which reproduces the issue here?

If nothing else can you post anchor tags so I can see what they look like? I suspect this is a relative path issue. Thanks!

[update]

After looking at your example its important to note that when you link to an embedded page, eg `#page-B` in your example, its going to be relative to the root document (aka the original page load). Only the first page `div` element in a document loaded via Ajax is included when a new request is made via ajax.

There were some changes that were added to jQuery Mobile for Beta 2 to help keep the DOM from growing out of control. If you want the old behavior, you can either turn off this automatic pruning, or pick and choose what pages should be kept in memory. You can find the details here:

2329,2011-08-23 22:04:23,"@jblas I tried setting $.mobile.page.prototype.options.domCache = true; just to see if this would help the issue but setting the domCache to true still removes the page element from the html.
",jostster,jblas
2329,2011-08-23 23:50:47,"Ok, so I debugged this on @jostster's system. the basic setup is that he has a listview with list items that when clicked, brings up an internal page with a form on it. There are several 'custom' selects on this page several of which are dialog selects, and the rest the small overlay select.

He programatically calls change page when a 'save' button is clicked, and the changePage request is for the page we came from. The culprit removing the form page is the pagehide callback registered from the select's close() function:



The 'this' reference in the callback is the page containing the actual select. I'm not familiar with that code, but I'm guessing it should be the custom select dialog that is getting removed. Right @jbender?
",jblas,jostster
2329,2011-08-24 00:16:53,"@jostster and @kinblas,

First, there's a bug fix in HEAD that only binds the remove when domcache allows it. That should give you a workaround in the short term.

The purpose of that rebinding is just as the comment says. We don't want to remove the page that a dialog comes from when we open said dialog, but we do want to remove that page when we go elsewhere so we disable it temporarily and then re-enable it. The dialog itself will be removed by the other pagehide.remove binding.

So:  



From what it the flow here appears to be



In which case the Form is being removed as we expect it to be. I would decorate the Form page with `data-dom-cache` false with the code from HEAD assuming I've understood the issue.

Thinking about this a bit more. We shouldn't be removing and restoring event handlers outside of the navigation code that does the pruning. Instead, we should probably introduce a concept of a lock attribute that the remove binding checks before actually executing the remove(). That way we can keep the details of how a page is pruned in one spot in the framework.

The locking mechanism can be a $.mobile.xxx API function that sets and/or increments a lock attribute on domCache=false elements.

Read [this](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/). Pull requests should come from a branch rather than master because it's easier to handle for the requester and you can continue to use your master for dev.
Now that you've fetched upstream, do:
1. `git merge upstream/master` you'll should get a conflict. 
2. Resolve the conflict
3. `git add` the conflicted file(s)
4. `git commit`
5. `git push origin` that will push changes to your origin repo and should automatically update the pull request.

I may be mistaken but the issue appears to be that you have two divs with the same `id`. In the second case the selector appears to work because it's _only_ an id but a more complex selector allows jQuery to be more permissive in finding elements. 

I'm not quite sure we can solve this for you. If you put two divs in the page with the same ID you need to deal with finding the one that you want in a given instance since the two pages being loaded are, as far as their urls are concerned, different (ie `test.php` and `test.php?a=foo`.
",johnbender,tluyben

EDIT: sorry, I missed the bottom part of your post; you are right. However I don't call that transparent, nor do others who I have seen struggling with the same issue. In fact _every_ JQuery mobile site made by devs (freelancers and employees) have this issue on at least 1 instance; everyone ASSUMES that it will work transparent, while it doesn't. What makes it harder is that it works the first time ofcourse (logically), so devs assume it works and then the client says it doesn't. I see your POV, however: 

""To enable animated page transitions, all links that point to an external page (ex. products.html) will be loaded via Ajax. To do this unobtrusively, the framework parses the link's href to formulate an Ajax request (Hijax) and displays the loading spinner. All this happens automatically by jQuery Mobile.""

Makes you believe the process is transparent wether you run via normal HTML or JQuery mobile => AKA you expect linking to work the same. But it doesn't. People who are USED to AJAX and have Firebug on 24/7, they can see this happening and understand it. But JQuery-mobile is supposed to be a framework which is easy to use meaning that a LOT of people working with it will never (or hardly) touch any jQuery but will just use HTML. And from that POV this is not transparent and I believe it should be addressed somehow. 

------ the rest I typed before, might be helpful, but we were already talking about the same thing. 

I'm not sure that's the case; the JQuery mobile transparent AJAX code (which parses the hrefs) makes this problem happen. If I switch Jquery mobile _off_ or if I used the non AJAX links everything works as expected. To make it more clear, before clicking the link; 

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6134596/Screenshots/6cp9w~3tg1r0.png

Then after clicking the link (as you can see there and in the link to stackoverflow I posted above; I copied and used that guy his code because it's simple and it's easy to reproduce the issue), it looks like this; 

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6134596/Screenshots/6516r8kdj528.png

As you can see, without me adding any code, just a standard link in JQuery-mobile, it copied a large part of the DOM and now there are two ids #show. This is logical, as AJAX does that and because we are pointing to the same page, the ids are the same after AJAX. However that's far from transparent and it's an issue I've now seen many times in IRC and in Stackoverflow and forums; people, after reading the docs of JQuery mobile expect transparent AJAX usage as described, but get, instead, 'weird' behavior. Logical behavior, but weird and not very convenient. And I think it's fixable on the JQuery-mobile side. 

But I might be wrong; then I would suggest as fix to make this clear in the documentation if it's a 'cannot or will not fix' in the code? 
",tluyben,johnbender
2317,2011-08-23 18:21:37,"@tluyben

Right, this seems like a documentation issue. Some bullet points we need to make sure stand out in the docs:
- Clicking a link to an external page will load that page via ajax. If that page contains data-role=""page"" elements, the first one will be imported. (ALREADY DOCUMENTED)
- If you want to load an external page that contains multiple data-role=""page"" elements, the link reference for that page should have a rel=""external"" attribute on it, which allows the browser to load that external page as a new document, instead of the normal AJAX means of the framework. (ALREADY DOCUMENTED)
- Any pages that are pulled in via AJAX must use unique id attribute values so there are no conflicts. This means that element ids for any page (internal or external) that are part of the application, and pulled in dynamically via Ajax, must be unique across all pages, not just within a given page. (NOT DOCUMENTED)

Note, I believe the last un-documented bullet point is something that most folks that use Ajax regularly are familiar with, but you are right, we need to spell it out for folks so that they are fully aware of the problem.

Second, have the above happen automatically and document it.

Third, have the form submit over ajax using the iframe technique.

Drawback to the first method is that the user has to read the docs and be aware of this limitation.

Drawback to the third method is the ""after"" part:
- Does the iframe then get converted to a normal ""page"" and then transitioned to it? If so, that is going to be a lot more code as it will need to convert the page and add it to stack. Also, it would probably need some kind of indicator that the file is uploading. Seems like a lot of work for not a whole lot of return value.
- Does the iframe only return some kind of status message and thus it is up to the user to figure out what to do with that message? This is just as bad as the first message

Seems like the correct solution would be the second approach. @toddparker thoughts? @chrisben, @fatmann09 would that be an acceptable solution?

I think we corrected the issue you've described. It was caused by the defaulting to clearing the pages ""cached"" in the DOM after being loaded. As a side note you can create a testable page with at jsbin.com or jsfiddle.net.

Steps I took to attempt to reproduce.
1. Click link ""Test List""
2. Click either of the list items
3. Click the back button
4. Click either of the previously clicked list item
5. Note that the page appears

I did notice that if you go back up to the top level page after clicking the nested list item and then attempt to click the link again it renders the original page for some reason. I'll look into that.

The easiest thing to do is bind to click, OR you can try the `vclick` special event included with the library which will attempt to swallow the click that follows based on the location.

The reason you can't just refer to the id of a div in the main application page, from an external page, is because it violates the rules of graceful degradation. By that, I mean ... if your application is loaded in a browser where we've had to disable the AJAX functionality for some reason, the external page will get loaded as a new document in the browser. If you click on a link with an @href=""#home"", the browser will try to resolve that against the URL of the external page that contains the link .. in other words it will try to find an element with an id of ""home"" in the external document.

Thanks for the sample. I linked your sample against the HEAD js/css and things work properly. We've fixed several bugs related to pushstate and navigation problems from external pages back to embedded divs in the main application document.

2245,2011-09-23 22:24:52,"@anpsince83

Assuming your 'home' is the first page in your main application document. We've added code to the HEAD that makes sure we can always resolve the document or base URL back to the first page in the application document, so you should be able to get to the first/page without duplicating it, even without your data-url workaround.

Your external page links just have to refer to the main application document and it should find it. So for example these urls should get you back to home:

/doc.html
/doc.html#home

I like @asgeo1's suggestion, and I see where this would simplify things but the event structure is a more general way to capture the page loading lifecycle. That is, there's no requirement of knowledge about the callsite to use the event structure.

Just to be clear it sounds like you're asking for something like:



Which just bloats the API in terms of invocation patterns and creates an ugly type union for the signature of the method given that we support that object as an options object. If we incorporated an events object as an option it would look like:

Yeah I remember when Scott landed the widget decoupling that I was thinking we really needed to formalize the phases a page goes through so we can dispatch appropriate events to give folks hooks to:
- Extract info from the raw page markup _BEFORE_ and _AFTER_ enhancement.
- Modify the default page markup _BEFORE_ enhancement.
- Modify the page markup _AFTER_ enhancement.

Something like:

pageinserted (Raw markup loaded and inserted into the DOM)
pageinit (Kickoff enhancement)
pageready (Ready to be used)

There are a couple of options here with trade-offs.
1. Add our own `_init` implementation as in the patch I posted above. One downside here is if someone wants to extend the jquerymobile widget they need to juggle the init to preserve our events. I talked with @ajpiano and he said that in jqueryui 1.9 it will invoke the super method so we've be fine here in the future as long as we plan to upgrade the jqueryui widget factory. My only real concern is that someone, somewhere has extended the mobile widget, defined init, and will hate me for all eternity if I break their code.
2. Decorate the `_create` method with a follow up `_trigger( 'aftercreate' )`. Fragile and is generally not very robust in the face of change. I don't like monkeypatching/decorating it surprises people and me down the road.
3. Alter the `jquery.ui.widget.js` and add the `_trigger( 'aftercreate' )` to the end of the `_create` method after the call to `_init`. Downside being that we now have to manage changes to the ui widget vs our patch unless we decide talk with the ui guys and move it upstream. In the latter case it would actually be `_trigger( 'init' )` to follow on with the convention of calling `_trigger( 'create' )` after calling the `_create` method. 

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.ui.widget.js#L158

You'll notice above that line the ordering goes create, trigger create, init, no trigger. 

I'll probably go with the first option and ask @toddparker to write it up in the blogpost in the hopes that people will raise an alarm. I still think `aftercreate` is the right event in this case.

In the latter case it would actually be `_trigger( 'init' )` to follow on with the convention of calling `_trigger( 'create' )` after calling the `_create` method. 

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.ui.widget.js#L158

You'll notice above that line the ordering goes create, trigger create, init, no trigger. 

I'll probably go with the first option and ask @toddparker to write it up in the blogpost in the hopes that people will raise an alarm. I still think `aftercreate` is the right event in this case.

Why not just call the event ""init"" ... and place the trigger after the init call in the UI base widget?

That way all widgets end up with a:
- &lt;widget&gt;create - Widget has been constructed but not initialized.
- &lt;widget&gt;init - Widget has been constructed and initialized and is ready to go.

2212,2011-09-26 18:23:23,"@marcing - I was able to reproduce this occasionally in my Android 2.2 phone. The issue is that we use vclick events which covers both mouse and touch events for faster performance. I think your scrolling code is moving the elements on the page so quickly that there is a mismatch between the target of the click and touch events. If you are going to scroll the page, I'd suggest waiting a bit before starting the scroll or switching the events to just use click, like your originally suggested. The issue is that there is a noticeable delay/lag if just using click so there is a tradeoff.

I agree with @marcing, this falls into that bucket of when not to use vclick ... which is anytime an action can cause the content underneath what is being clicked to change.

2211,2011-09-29 23:04:04,"@tqc, I agree that the dialog most often will have an effect on the parent page, I don't think you will necessarily always want the parent's page show/hide events running when opening a dialog or returning from one.

For instance in our app, the parent page gets populated on pagebeforeshow with data that is a result of parameters set on the previous page and the page controls are reset on pagehide. So if you return to the parent page from the dialog its pagebeforeshow event will run, but the page has already been populated with data and the parameters that are set in the previous page are missing, because you are returning from the dialog. Or when you open the dialog, the pagehide event is run, and the controls are reset.

I think it would be more logical to suppress the parent's show/hide events when opening/returning from a dialog. And use the dialog's pagebeforehide or pagehide event to manipulate the parent page.

The only problem I have with assuming we shouldn't reload the underlying page when going back to it is that if someone does in fact want to have it reloaded they can, and, in the case where they don't want it to be reloaded/reaped they can simply decorate the page with `data-dom-cache=true`. 

To put it another way, you can have it behave either way right now by altering the markup if you need to but if we make it the default to retain the page it'll be much harder to remove it and have it refreshed by the server.

With all that said, this doesn't address the visual issues.

2211,2011-10-07 20:32:32,"@johnbender, I actually have `data-dome-cache=true` set on my parent page to maintain its state, but unfortunately its pageshow/pagehide events still fire which results in page manipulations that are not wanted.

IMHO, even though a dialog is actually another page, I think it would be great to have an option added to `$.mobile.changePage` that when combined with opening a dialog allows the parent page to remain in the DOM and it's pageshow/pagehide events do not fire. That way it truly acts like a dialog, and is a modal that leaves the page below untouched.

2211,2011-10-07 20:41:26,"@anpsince83

I'll concede that the semantics of `pageshow` and `pagehide` are up for debate when showing a dialog but I think the behavior would be equally confusing for someone who's expecting `pagehide` when a dialog comes up. Maybe a third event (`pageblur`?) where a dialog or custom select menu is raised and the previous page persists behind it. Spitballing.

",johnbender,anpsince83
2211,2011-10-07 20:56:15,"@johnbender, I can definitely see the argument both ways when it comes to `pageshow` and `pagehide`.

Is the issue the difference between single and multiple page apps? I use multiple html files, which makes create/show behave much like the show/blur described here. An additional event that appears to do the same as an existing event may be confusing.

I haven't looked into the code to see how easy it would be to implement, but adding some additional information to the pageshow event could help - either the id/role of the previous page or a flag indicating that the transition was triggered with back. With this information the pageshow handler can easily determine that the page state hasn't changed since it was last shown and skip the update.

Though I disagree with @anpsince83 on updating parent pages directly from dialogs, the reference to the previous page would also be useful in that context.

@johnbender Do you guys do something that might tell the browser to cancel loading a page? I wonder, if that happens on a UIWebView's first page then it seems that the UIWebView's history management doesn't get initialized correctly and the back behavior breaks.

Fortunately we have an easy enough workaround, first load a non-JQM page in the UIWebView. In Phonegap's case I believe their iframe does the trick, in my codebase a 'start.html' that redirects to the JQM page works.

Just an FYI, this landed on the HEAD. The events to listen for are pagebeforeload, pageload, and pageloadfailed. A data object is passed as the 2nd arg of a bound callback.

The pageload event data contains an additional property that is the jQuery collection that contains the page that was just loaded and inserted into the DOM.

Or did you delete the entire moveHandler() function?

Looking at the code the $.event.special.swipe.scrollSupression really isn't necessary. We can simply remove the whole ""if"" expression and just call event.preventDefault() since most browsers won't scroll anyways until after the 10px threshold is hit. The user won't see any difference between us checking or not checking ... but I'm not sure if the calculations in the ""if"" expression are what you are referring to as the thing killing your performance?

As a test, I changed it to 100 and it drastically improved the scrolling performance (because it was no longer suppressing it).  I put the &lt;a&gt; tags back in just to make sure everything was still breezing along and sure enough...listview scrolling was still vastly improved.

I haven't taken the time to investigate the side-effects of setting it to 100, but I can't imagine any side effect would be worse than suppressing my scrolling.

2107,2012-07-18 16:33:32,"@jblas @toddparker - I was doing some testing last night on my shiny new Nexus 7 and noticed that listview scrolling performance was about as bad as I've ever experienced in the project I've been working on for the past 8 months or so.  I've read all the posts that suggest to disable drop shadows and other css to make the listview style as simple as possible.  I've also read all the posts about how bad scrolling performance is when the listview items are links (&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;whatever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;).  So, I removed the &lt;a&gt; tags and made my listviews just listviews that don't link to anything.  Scrolling performance was still the same...horrible.  But, then I noticed that if I scrolled on the left or right side of the listview very carefully without touching the listview items, then scrolling was vastly improved (close to native).  But, I just didn't understand why scrolling seemed to stop anytime my scroll ventured just a wee bit over to where it hovered over any listview item while scrolling.  Here's the answer I came up with (and it seems so did @adriancd a year ago :\ )

Line 125 of js/events/touch.js

Or, line 1898 of the latest release jquery.mobile-1.1.1.js

scrollSupressionThreshold: 10, // More than this horizontal displacement, and we will suppress scrolling.

So, it wasn't the fact that my finger was venturing over a listview item as I scrolled with a slight arc at the finish of my scroll (or during the scroll) ... it was that the ""horizontal displacement"" of my scroll was at some point exceeding the threshold of 10px!!? and suppressing the scroll!  As a test, I changed it to 100 and it drastically improved the scrolling performance (because it was no longer suppressing it).  I put the &lt;a&gt; tags back in just to make sure everything was still breezing along and sure enough...listview scrolling was still vastly improved.

I haven't taken the time to investigate the side-effects of setting it to 100, but I can't imagine any side effect would be worse than suppressing my scrolling.

2107,2012-07-18 18:24:31,"Thanks @dcarrith - So we just upgraded our Nexus 7 to Jellybean this morning so I can't test it with ICS. I tested the list perf page running 4.1 and didn't see much of a difference. Same goes for a Galaxy Nexus S running 4.0.4 with the default browser and Chrome.

Is there a test page and steps to reproduce for me to reproduce this?
",toddparker,dcarrith
2107,2012-07-18 18:41:06,"@scottjehl - unless I'm misunderstanding something, I think the 10px ""horizontal displacement"" threshold is left/right movement threshold.  So, I think 100px still makes sense.  A swipe left or right would be more like 200-400 right?

2107,2012-07-18 18:54:04,"@dcarrith - we're open to changing this default if it improves things. I'm still struggling to see a difference in scrolling between this being set to 2, 10, 100 or even 1,000 on my nexus 7. Does this have to be on a very long listview to see the problem?

2107,2012-07-18 19:01:19,"@scottjehl - 30px seems to be a much better default.  I'll still probably override it and make it 50 or so because my thumb swipes veer pretty far left and right.

2107,2012-07-18 23:18:28,"@dcarrith What is listening for swipe left/right on your page? We don't have many pages in the tests that make use of those events so the code in action may notbeinplay, hence the difference.
",jblas,dcarrith
2107,2012-07-18 23:52:56,"@jblas - Good f'n question!  I didn't think to comment out the swipeleft and swiperight event handlers to see if that scrollSupressionThreshold would still be used for differentiating between a scroll with a swipe.  After commenting them out, scrolling is very much improved since that moveHandler code isn't trying to grab stop and start position and then compare all the thresholds, which most of the time seems to evaluate to true because of some wacky values ... thereby calling preventDefault.  

So, the next test I did was to comment out all the code inside of the swipeleft and swiperight which was actually an old hack that dates back to when double and triple events would be fired for swipeleft and swiperight.  So, now I just have two empty swipeleft and swiperight handlers:

$('body').on('swipeleft', function(evt, ui) {
//empty
});

$('body').on('swiperight', function(evt, ui) {
// empty
});

I added in an alert right above the event.preventDefault just to see what it's comparing to scrollSupressionThreshold each time and am seeing some strange values (On Galaxy Nexus ICS 4.0.4 in a Cordova App as well as Chrome and on a Nexus 7 in a cordova app and in Chrome).  I'm not really sure what to make of it.  But, in the simplest test, if you scroll on one side of the listview and then scroll on the other side of the listview, the if statement evaluates to true and event.preventDefault is called.  Even with the smallest scroll, it triggers and the alerts I have in place are all over the map.  It's really hard to describe.  But, if you have a chance, throw this alert in there and take a look.     

// prevent scrolling
if ( Math.abs( start.coords[ 0 ] - stop.coords[ 0 ] ) > $.event.special.swipe.scrollSupressionThreshold ) {
    alert(""Math.abs(""+start.coords[0]+"" - ""+stop.coords[0]+"") > ""+$.event.special.swipe.scrollSupressionThreshold+""\n so, would normally have called event.preventDefault to prevent scrolling"");
    event.preventDefault();

Thanks for staying on top of us on this. 
While we're still not convinced that we'll want to recommend or implement this feature in an officially-supported sense (due to its JS-dependence, its use of local anchors in a non-standard way, and the fact that external pages handle dynamic content well already), there's probably a way to do what you're trying to do already.

One way to do it is similar to the approach @azicchetti described above, and I can't imagine it'd regress in upcoming releases. 
Something like this could probably do what you're trying to do...



Here's a demo page that demonstrates:
- demo: http://jsbin.com/iluxey/
- src: http://jsbin.com/iluxey/edit

Again, we'd recommend structuring things differently to use external pages for dynamic content like this - served as html or otherwise - instead of a multipage document. 
We're planning to blog about some ways to do this in the coming weeks.
Hope this helps!

When they are finished I take the form and post it back to the server.  Wrapping all of the pages in a single FORM element allows me to keep all of the input together on the client and prevents me from needing to go back to the server between each page request.

I hadn't thought of the history issues you pointed out. I'm using jQM primarily inside PhoneGap so the browser back/forward buttons aren't an issue for me (I've disabled the hardware back button in Android for all my PG projects). I'm guessing this fix might only be useful in my specific scenario.

I'm using jQM in multi-page mode, so all my pages are in a single index.html file in my PhoneGap project. In this scenario data-rel=""back"" buttons are all broken in BB5. They simply do nothing, possibly because there's no previous page in the history stack. On the web when navigating pages in a multi-page setup, if you click the BB5 back button, you're returned to the last ""real"" page you visited. Any multi-page pages navigated aren't remembered.

Hope this helps.

Just wanted to let you know that we really appreciate your hard work on this. The team decided that it was better to delegate this work out to you guys on your individual projects for two primary reasons:
1. As the length of the discussion here indicates, search semantics are complicated to explain and implement. The documentation will almost always fall short in complex cases for people trying to understand how it will work. 
2. As we approach Beta 3 and our release candidate work, we need to start curtailing our supportable feature addition so that we can get the issue/bug list into a manageable place. In short we're prioritizing bugs at this point but we still wanted to give you the flexibility to do what you needed to do in your projects.

I'm getting the same issue I believe: if a page fetched via ajax contains sub pages, those sub pages won't load at all if linked to from the page, via the usual jqm method of linking to the sub page's ID. Instead, the index page of the site loads again in their place.

Presumably multi page layouts are still allowed (and in turn, linking to those sub pages), even when having been fetched via ajax?

1925,2011-08-23 23:19:25,"@Brons

Yeah I have a fix in mind for that particular bug. The problem with inputs/textareas is that they react to mousedown to get focus. We're processing the select choice made by the user on touchend which occurs before the fake mouse events are dispatched ... and even then we are only usually concerned about blocking any fake mouse click that happens.

The only way for us to fix this problem, is to avoid it by moving our actions back to the ""click"" event. Unfortunately this means a 300 millisecond pause between touch and action on some platforms like iOS ... that said, it's better to have expected versus incorrect behavior.
",jblas,Brons
1925,2011-08-24 22:29:18,"@jostster

Short of calling preventDefault() on a touchstart event, we have no control of what the browser calculates as the target of the synthesized mouse events that follow touchend are. The only reliable cross-implementation way to avoid problems is to execute actions on the mouse events (click) ... that way things like the thing being clicked on disappearing before mouse events are dispatched, don't happen.

Checkout this article that tries to spell out a few of the gnarly problems:

http://blogs.adobe.com/adobeandjquery/2011/03/07/the-current-state-of-touch-events/
",jblas,jostster
1925,2011-08-24 23:21:46,"@jblas I've tried vclick and everything for the footer nav bar. it doesn't seem to be an issue inside of chrome while testing but inside iOS and Andriod it is still a problem. Not as much as using tap but still everyonce in awhile it will still trigger the event below it.

Setting all my taps to vclicks actually prevents the navbar from working at all.
",jostster,jblas
1925,2011-08-24 23:25:55,"@jostster

Right, on touch devices vclick maps to the touchend, which is _BEFORE_ the browser dispatches the synthesized mouse events ... hence the problem.

The problem is that the targets of the touch events and the synthesized mouse events don't necessarily match. In the select case on a touch device, the item on the select menu is chosen on vclick (touchend), but part of the select action is to dismiss immediately (before the mouse events are dispatched). When the browser finally fires the mouse events, it does some heuristics, mainly position related, to figure out what the target should be, since the select menu is gone, it chooses whatever is there, in this case its a text input (textarea).
",jblas,jostster
1925,2011-08-24 23:38:00,"@jblas My issue isn't with the select box and text area but with the footer and listview behind it. It seems that about 1 out of 15 touches triggers the footer nav bar event then the event for the list item underneath the footer nav bar.

I wasn't able to duplicate it on the demo site because you guys had it going to different html pages while we are having it go to different pages via hash.
",jostster,jblas
1925,2011-08-24 23:46:19,"@jostster

It's still related to the touch and mouse event target mismatches. Remember above when I said heuristics? Each vendor has their own way to figure out what point a fat finger-print is supposed to represent ... unfortunately in some implementations they factor in markup hierarchy, and it also seems that the coordinates calculated and used in the events are different.

A while back when I first started looking into these problems, I put together some test pages that demostrated the problems we were up against:

http://webpro.host.adobe.com/people/jblas/research/events/touch-and-mouse.html
http://webpro.host.adobe.com/people/jblas/research/events/touch-and-mouse3.html

The last example there was especially worrisome since you could tap on something and the touch event would have the target you clicked on, but the mouse events that were fired were for something 200px away that didn't intersect with what you touched.

I mentioned the solution earlier ... perform the action on the mouse events instead of the touch events. That way you don't factor in the browser's potential event target mismatches. Unfortunately this also means that action response times seem a bit sluggish ... roughly 300ms.

Because of this problem we've had to back off of our aggressive fire off actions on vclick approach that we started in alpha 4, which is unfortunate since it made things very responsive.

The bottom line is that trying to treat touch events like mouse events only works well when you have an environment where things don't overlap.

Aside from all that, I don't think you're using square brackets in the way they were meant to be used in the URL.  So, I think you need to urlencode them.  From http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt:

A host identified by an Internet Protocol literal address, version 6
   [RFC3513] or later, is distinguished by enclosing the IP literal
   within square brackets (""["" and ""]"").  This is the only place where
   square bracket characters are allowed in the URI syntax.  In
   anticipation of future, as-yet-undefined IP literal address formats,
   an implementation may use an optional version flag to indicate such a
   format explicitly rather than rely on heuristic determination.

Re: `if (elm.type !== ""text"") { /* number input supported, probably spinners, so add extra padding... */`

If the input type is not ""text"" it doesn't mean it is ""number"" (""date"", ""tel"", ""password"", ""file"", ""search"").
We could target the number input in CSS (`input[type=""number""]`) to set extra padding, but I am not in favor of this because I don't agree with ""probably spinners"". So far I've only seen them on Chrome desktop, Safari desktop, Opera desktop, and Opera Mobile.
Other solution is to set extra margin on the spinner (`-webkit-inner/outer-spin-button`) but that probably looks a bit weird.

About the date input: On Safari desktop a spinner is added. Chrome desktop, Opera desktop, and Opera Mobile show a ""select indicator"" for the datepicker. On Chrome for Android there is no indicator for the datepicker, but the clear button doesn't work.

1834,2012-11-30 14:18:33,"@ray007 

The behaviour and button icon of this feature are hardcoded, but you could copy and edit the code to add a custom button. Prevent the framework from enhancing the input and bind a call to your function to the ""pagecreate"" event.
As long as you use the same classes on the input, the wrapper div and the button (`.ui-input-clear`) the CSS will be fine.

However, when it comes to the file input you are very limited in what you can customize, because of security reasons. File inputs are meant to submit a local file, not a file from your server, so you can't access that via Ajax.

I'd have to see how you are actually binding your handler, but if you do something like this:

$(""#foo"").bind(""vclick"", function() { alert(""vclick triggered!""); });

If you use a touchscreen, the alert will fire on the touchend event. The alert should not fire, when the click event is dispatched. Note that vclick does _NOT_ suppress the synthesized mouse/click events that are generated by the browser because it does not know what context it is being used in, _AND_ form input elements require the mouse/click events to function normally.

If you use a joystick or mouse (desktop), the alert will fire on the normal mouse click event.

If you want to suppress the click event while using touch, you have to call event.preventDefault() in your vclick handler. This will queue the request to kill the click event that follows but due to the differences in the way device vendors implement their events, and some bugs within different android OS versions, this turns out to be very hard to do. We try a couple of methods to figure out  whether or not to kill a click event ... one is based on the element the touch event was triggered, on, and another is the position of the touch event. This is necessary because The browser does not necessarily dispatch the mouse events to the same element that it used for the touch event.

Checkout this test case:

I think what you want to do is listen for the ""changepage"" notification instead of the ""pageshow"" notification. The pageshow notification signals the end of the transition between the old page and the new page. The changepage notifications says everything is done now. If you call changePage() after the ""changepage"" notification fires, your change request won't get queued.

1746,2011-12-06 18:09:58,"@jblas Here is more detail about my issue, which sounds exactly like what @hanami279 was experiencing in September: 

Device: Verizon HTC Droid Incredible 
OS: Android 2.2 
Browser: Webkit 3.1

I have a basic carousel HTML structure set up on my page, in which an absolutely positioned DIV (.product_carousel_slider) is meant to slide around inside of a relatively positioned DIV, when the user triggers a ""swipeleft"" or ""swiperight"" event.

$('.product_carousel_slider').bind('swipeleft swiperight', function(e){
    e.preventDefault();
    xProductCarousel.moveCarousel(e.type);
}

(inside of xProductCarousel object:)
moveCarousel:function(sEventType){
    var scrollAmount = xProductCarousel.nViewportWidth;
    this.nCurrentPosition = (sEventType === 'swipeleft') ? this.nCurrentPosition - scrollAmount : this.nCurrentPosition + scrollAmount;



}

This works as expected on other Android devices I've tested, including the Kindle Fire, the HTC Inspire. Also works well on the iPhone. The problem is that on my test HTC Droid Incredible, the browser freezes, and only after the user touches/clicks in desperation does the browser slowly come back to life.

correction: 2 or more history length, right? ==> no

You might confusing about history length and $( "".ui-page"" ).length
@toddparker (and also me!) wants a back button if history lenght is 1 or more.
Additionally you need to change the auto-add back btn condition. You will need to change following condition 
current ==> $( "".ui-page"" ).length > 1 
expected ==> $( "".ui-page"" ).length > 0

I had the weirdest problem with this. I'll start from the top:

I was using the 1.04a1 which was loading images without any issues, however in a dynamic thumbnail list the first list item was not being styled properly on a .listview() refresh. On switching to the nightly builds images that were dynamically added failed to load whereas those that were included in the index.html and css loaded fine despite following the exact same relative paths. 

@StevenBlack I am using the latest nightly builds along with the latest jquery javascript file.

@jblas to answer your question. In my app I have a link tab dedicated to 'News', when this page is loaded an ajax request is used to load an xml rss feed, at which point the image src attributes are updated and the listview is refreshed to update the styling.

As mentioned previously I found the issue to reside at:

line 448
var fauxBase = location.protocol + '//' + location.host + location.pathname,

For some reason this is pointing to (notice the extra slash after the www directory):

""file:///var/mobile/mobile/Applications/1D19-E6F1-3C62-4967-80D5-DD5D091B24A6/test.app/www//index.html""

However upon removing the hardcoded url and returning to the original line all be it minus the 'ui-dir/' ending my app began to display the images once again.



I have now submitted my app, but over the past few days based on others comments here I have a horrible feeling my test devices may have cached the hardcoded links. If this is the case I'm pretty sure it will get the book thrown at it in the review process lol. Schoolboy error on my behalf to not clear the cache but time will tell.

I was thinking of working in a data-role=""list-title"" attribute that
would indicate which element's text should be used as the page title
for the nested list. If no data-role is found then it would fall back
to using the first non-image element. Thoughts? I have this working
locally, but wanted to run it by somebody before sending a pull
request. Also, if this approach sounds acceptable, should I update
some of the example code to indicate usage of the data-role or
something?

I have an unrelated question you might know the answer to ... when I
diff or view my git commits on github they show that the whole file
has changed even though only 1 line changed. I'm guessing this has
something to do with newline endings - any clue? I'm developing in
NetBeans 7 on Windows 7. Also, are there any coding guidelines or
standards for the project? e.g. tab width settings, etc. I just want
to make sure I'm sticking to existing conventions.

introducing a data-role=""list-title"" which is added to the child

The first time you visit page 2 the `pagecreate` event fires and the page and all widgets on it will be enhanced.
When you navigate back to page 1, page 2 remains in the DOM. So if you manipulate the markup at that moment you have  to call the plugin to enhance the new markup, because the second time you visit page 2 the ""pagecreate"" event doesn't fire.

The prefilter looks like a potential solution. I don't think `navigator.onLine` is the suitable value to check though as the appcache can be used even if the device is online. Under iOS `navigator.standalone`, which indicates if the site has been launched as a web app, is a better option.

Yeah, you're right. It treats all requests as local when a cache exists. As you point out though it is a bit of a hack. Maybe the check or one similar should be pushed into xhr.js in jQuery main rather than relying purely on isLocal behaving this way forever.

The client side can detect a redirect by examining the HTTP status code for a value of 302 and the location header for the url.

This [stackover post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/199099/how-to-manage-a-redirect-request-after-a-jquery-ajax-call/1534662#1534662) shows how a redirect can be detected by a `jQuery.ajax` call.

JQM currently handles redirects properly. It performs a get on the new url and updates the DOM. It just doesn't replace the url hash in the browser with the updated url.

Also the `data-url` attribute solution will not work in some MVC scenarios because a view (which contains the page layout) can be shared by multiple controllers (which are the URL endpoints)

We're in the process of working on a system for automating page removal without removing certain types of pages that can't be refetched from the server (nested listview pages, local multipages, dynamically generated pages, etc). It's likely that we'll implement this in two ways: first, a configurable limit for the max number of pages to keep in the dom at any time (which could default to something quite low, maybe zero, who knows), and second, a simple mechanism to specify that a certain page should never be stored in the DOM, or that a certain page type should never be removed from the DOM through the max-limit flushing.

`$.mobile.activeBtnClass` is used to set the name of the class which is later on used to define variables.
If you look at this code snippet `var activeBtn = $( ""."" + $.mobile.activeBtnClass ).first();` you'll understand that setting it to `""""` will cause an error.
So this is not a bug, but more a matter of using a function for something that it's not designed for. There is (currently) no option to have no ""active button class"" being added at all, but setting the class name to something that doesn't exist in the CSS will give the same result.

Your jsbin example is calling changePage() with the old _alpha_ signature for changePage(). Is there a reason you need to use buttons and onclick handlers to do the changePage() calls in your example? I ask because things work as expected if you changed page2b from using:



to a simple link:



And this markup on page3b:



with this simple link:



The problem here, aside from the fact that you are calling changePage() with and old-style convention which is no longer supported, is that changePage() really only moves you forward in history. In ""Go Back"" link above, a data-rel=""back"" attribute is used to tell the framework to simply call window.history.back() when it is clicked, which is what I think you were after in the first place, right?

Unless someone knows how to trigger the default iOS behavior, I'm not sure how we could make this work. I think auto parsing HTML for phone like patterns like the native behavior does would be overreaching. I'd suggest that if you want something to be a linked phone number, that you use the tel: link format and not reply on the various OSs doing this for you.

I'm going to close this because it can't really be fixed from what I understand. I tagged this as a feature request so we can review this at a later point to see if either iOS changes their behavior or if we want to polyfill this on our side.

1464,2011-09-02 18:55:07,"@22222 @toddparker 

I'm not sure the ""tap"" event was intended to be an alias for the ""click"" event. I think the intent was to give the developer some way to trigger an action on touchend (for touch devices) instead of waiting the 300ms or so before the browser got around to synthesizing the related mouseup/click. With that intent in mind, I'm not sure calling preventDefault() on a ""tap"" event should prevent the default action of a link.

Now ""vclick"" is a different story. Calling preventDefault() on a ""vclick"" event should prevent a link for executing its default action. It actually does do what you expect on a touch device, but there is currently a bug in the mouse event handling code for jquery.mobile.vmouse.js where the isDefaultPrevented(), isPropagationStopped(), and isImmediatePropagationStopped() settings are not being propagated from the virtual event to the original mouse event. I have a fix for this.

In all 3 cases (""vclick"", ""tap"", and ""taphold"") the stopPropagation() and stopImmediatePropagation() should _NOT_ execute any handlers that follow the one doing the stop, and the events should cease to bubble up the DOM tree.

There seems to be a bug in the implementation of ""taphold"" where 2 elements in the same parent/child hierarchy that are bound to ""taphold"" each fire-off their own ""taphold"" timer. This means that if the child element is the thing being tapped, 2 timers will be fired off, one for the child and one for the parent/ancestor, resulting in 2 different events bubbling up the tree.

1463,2011-05-06 10:50:37,"I with @aliok on this one, in what case would the auto-update be of good use?

I'm aware that jQM is minded at a large variety of devices/OS, but in iPhone for instance (I don't have experience with other)
- If auto-hide-url-bar is working, then its not even visible, thus why change it.
- If auto-hide-url-bar is NOT working then you have the same text above the URL and in then again right in the header.
- And as @aliok points out the 'Add to homescreen' uses document.title, thus the text on the homescreen will be different, depending on what page the user is looking at when adding to homescreen - with jQM auto-update enabled.

Therefore I vote for a configuration option or a removal of the auto-update, or perhaps a config option with default value set to false/disabled.

The transitions used within jQuery Mobile make use of CSS3 keyframes. Firefox does not support CSS3 keyframes yet, though I heard it landed in the FireFox 6 branch.

Switching over to using CSS3 transitions would require extra JS logic, specific to each transition, to make sure all properties being animated for the transition have the initial ""from"" values set prior to triggering the CSS transition.

@matthewdl: Thanks for the feedback. We're working on recommendations for scaling the framework up to tablet and desktop, but so far the transitions were mostly targeted for the mobile browsers that supported them at the time we created them. Now that support has expanded, we aren't intentionally excluding any browsers from transitions, we just haven't gotten around to adding more prefixes for browsers that support our current setup (which is based on keyframes). We've had a ticket open for this for some time, and we're looking to add other prefixes soon. 

That said, we're not entirely sure how our transitions should play out by default in desktop browsers yet, since many of the transitions tend to feel distracting and unnatural in that environment for simple page changes (particularly the slide transitions). Since page transitions are more common in mobile browsing than the desktop web currently, we didn't see this as a major issue for beta 1, but we're starting to work on it now. Slight tangent, but on the new docs site, we've set our transitions differently depending on window width, moving to ""fade"" around 600px and up, and then to ""none"" at 1000 and up. We may experiment with this thinking in the coming weeks, and we'd love your feedback. 

Anyway, we're looking to broaden our transitions support now, ideally without adding too much bloat to the css. Maybe the suggestion above will be a good starting point to explore.

Thanks!

As per our earlier discussions, and the ""correct"" behavior, the data-url specified in markup is NOT url encoded -- just HTML entity encoded where necessary.

A big annoyance here is that previously, 1.4.5 just didn't support some stuff (like CSS background gradients). Now it does -- but in a completely broken way. So you end up with stuff like this, actually _worse_ than it was before.

I'll have to dive in more to see how you guys are doing stuff, but can you load platform-specific CSS code? That could disable certain things that are broken in webOS 2.x.

We're big fans of WebOS and have been testing every release on both the Pixi and Pre 1 running 1.4 (they're not upgradable). I didn't realize that people were using 2.0 because the new devices running it aren't landing until the summer but now I see that the Pre 2 is upgradable now so it needs to be on our radar. We'll take a look at this in the emulator and try to figure out what CSS properties + combinations are causing the most issues.

I can't imagine they would leave the browser in it's current form because so much of the web must be broken on it. I'm not sure how JQM could even make this work better without dropping all corners, shadows and gradients from WebOS and that's not really an option because we won't use UA detection.

1337,2011-05-02 15:16:41,"@funkatron - We did some preliminary work for a few hours to try and figure out what CSS properties were causing the worst rendering issues but removing the usual suspects (shadows, rounded corners, gradients) but this didn't seem to have any positive impact on rendering quality. We were hoping that by killing one of these for WebOS 2, things would look a lot better, but no luck.

The really mysterious thing is the extra vertical spacing between list items and similar elements. We didn't get to test every property, but no matter what we did, we weren't' able to get list to kill the extra spacing. It's like 2.0 adds ~2px of vertical margins in there for no good reason.

Lastly, we weren't able to reproduce that really bad screenshot with the inverted looking bg gradient - are you seeing  that in current builds?

If you have some time to really dig in and try to figure out how we can adjust the CSS to fix these issues, we'd really appreciate it. And, yes, the /test/ URL is synced every few minutes with the latest in Git so that's the best to test. There is also a nightly/latest version on the CDN now you can use for testing:

changePage() and loadPage() actually find the exact same page. So unless I'm missing something, I don't think this a problem anymore? I tested on FF, Chrome, and Safari.

@alexfalkowski was there a specific browser, platform, and/or device you were seeing this problem on?

I think the gist of this bug is that when folks dynamically inject a page, they aren't tagging it with a @data-url attribute, so we aren't finding it. I suppose I can add some fallback code that checks to see if the page being requested is an embedded page, and if its not found via the data-url lookup, we could always do a 2nd pass lookup by id. What do you think?

We're already doing a fallback 2nd pass for catching references to the first embedded page of the application document since that might not have an id, and therefore no data-url value, associated with it.

1225,2011-03-16 14:12:35,"@dirs, yes, thanks for the correction. 

We'll be changing the global default config to set the native menu option to true so after A4, you'll need to opt in to the custom selects. If people want to go back to using custom menus, they will be able to set this config option back to false via JS or set data-native-menu=""false"" on individual select menus.

I believe this is coming from the vmouseover and vmouseout handlers in buttonMarkup.js. If you want to totally eliminate hover class for buttonMarkup on touch devices, we could just switch back to plain-old mouseover and mouseout, which won't get generated on Touch devices. What do you think?
",jblas,toddparker
1215,2011-09-20 02:16:07,"Hi @jblas - let's go ahead and make this switch. The mouse events will cover the desktop and focus-based interaction modes and eliminate the scroll hover state oddness on touch.
",toddparker,jblas
1215,2011-09-20 22:21:41,"@toddparker

Turns out the state we are seeing when touch is started is actually the ui-btn-down class, and not the ui-btn-hover as first thought. To me this makes things a bit different since disabling that, or moving it to placing those classes on the real-mouse events means we will never see these feedback visuals for all buttonMarkup components on a touch device.

I verified that we are indeed generating a vmousecancel event in the case that a touch results in a scroll, so we _ARE_ removing the ui-btn-down class ... it's just that the screen won't update till you actually lift your finger since the browser caches the viewport bitmap while you are drag-scrolling.

I think we're going to punt on this. Closing per @toddparker.

- restricts support to pages loaded via http/https. This is because that code path also handles mail:/tel: and other protocols.

Thanks for looking into this more. I'm still trying to get phonegap set up on my system, but it involves me updating my cygwin, which is taking a long while to download.

Yeah, we need to remove the path.origin stuff. It should be a complete no-op so I'm not sure why Chrome would be failing. origin seems to be initialized to a blank string?

I'll give loading a local file:// URL a try and see if I can see what you're seeing.

If you are loading your document via file:// and then using an URL of http://www.server.com, the load would qualify as a cross-domain request, which I believe should fail in most browsers when using XHR.

Is it possible for you to move your mojo.js and phone gap includes above the jquery mobile include ?

I think the base tag jqm is injecting may be causing the mojo.js load to fail.

So in your case the link you are clicking on is _NOT_ relative to the document, but an absolute file:// URL? Do things work if you use relative URLs?

I'm thinking the fix should be that if we detect a protocol being used, that we first compare it against the base path before assuming it is an external link.

I'll need to talk to Scott J. to ask why it is currently assuming that all absolute URLs are external.

Sorry I forgot you were using cross-domain URLs. That means our code is working as designed since normally that's not possible in a browser due to security restrictions.

I just checked the Phone Gap FAQ:

http://wiki.phonegap.com/w/page/16494770/FAQ

It says:

""The cross-domain security policy does not affect PhoneGap applications. Since the html files are called by webkit with the file:// protocol, the security policy does not apply.
(in Android,you may grant android.permission.INTERNET to your app by edit the AndroidManifest.xml﻿﻿﻿)﻿""

Perhaps what we need is a config option that disables our cross-domain check and allows it to fall through to the page loading code. If developers set this option for an app that is loaded in a normal (non-Phone Gap browser) that errors may occur.

Thanks for taking the time to debug it. We fixed that a while back, in our HEAD, after we released Alpha 3.

Just for clarity, there were 3 issues biting phone gap folks:
- jQuery 1.5 broke file://.
- jQuery 1.5.1 fixed file:// but was thinking HTML files were XML, we worked around it by specifying dataType at time we made ajax call.
- We weren't allowing JQM to load cross-domain JQM pages. We've since added a configuration parameter for that (Issue 1191).

It happens in the HEAD. The problem is very similar to issue 785, but the events involved have to be mouse*. Just registering an event handler, even one that does absolutely nothing, for mousedown, mouseup, click, etc (I'm working on the complete list for Apple) is enough to disable selection.

I think elements with these mouse listeners become what apple calls clickable:

Judging from the comments here and the fact that using the jqm emulation produces the desired result it sounds like everyone expects this to be a post orientationchange event. That is an event that is triggered when the orientation changes and the document element size has been altered. The docs are actually ambiguous as to whether the orientation value will be pre/post change.

> Triggers when a device orientation changes (by turning it vertically or horizontally). When bound to this event, your callback function can leverage a second argument, which contains an orientation property equal to either ""portrait"" or ""landscape"". These values are also added as classes to the HTML element, allowing you to leverage them in your CSS selectors. Note that we currently bind to the resize event when orientationChange is not natively supported.

There's a case to be made for having an orientation change event that fires _before_ the document element has resized, but for now after I double check with the team I'll look into making the current `orientationchange` event include the post resize orientation value and clarifying the documentation a bit.

Yah, I noted that in the message before the commit. The change only gets the user the right value, but because the different browsers fire the event at different times, most importantly _after_ the resize has occurred, we don't have an easy way of making sure the event happens when the screen is the right size. We might address this post 1.0, but not before.

We'll hopefully try and address the quirks here but the combination of the event firing many times per orientation change in conjunction with the poor consistency in timing is going to make it difficult if not impossible. For sure this won't be fixed before 1.0.

This jump before transitions is the only thing that keeps me from using jQuery Mobile as it's the easiest and most compatible mobile framework out there. I think that I'm not the only person who would sacrifice compability to fix that. 

Maybe you can give me some hint how to turn it off so I can experiment with some solutions? I commented out almost all code which I thought was responsible for this jump but it still occurs - is there some tricky way how the jump/scrol top is done?

The problem is that I want both Ajax request + animations without scroll to top. I can see from comments that it's hard to achieve so I would chill out. I still think that this can be achieved if we first switch the page to our ""loading page"" (maybe with no content so we can scroll to top without visible jump) and then show loaded content.

Your not the first to ask for this option, and perhaps we should consider a way to turn it off via a config option. The problem that @toddparker was referring to above was that without doing the ""scroll to the top"", transitions to new pages will result in a change in the document height ... the problem is different browsers do different things when this happens. Some stay at the current scroll offset even when the document height is less than that offset, resulting in what looks like a blank page, while others will adjust accordingly showing you the bottom of the new page content. Aside from this problem, it just looks wierd to see a transition that doesn't involve the top of a document.

Believe me when I say we have tried several times to figure out how to make this smoother, for example offsetting the rendering of the new page by the current scroll position during the transition, etc ... but we always get bitten by blinky/flashing rendering when we fix the scroll position for the new page because the browser thinks it hasn't rendered that part of the document.

I just wanted to give you a feeling of the types of issues you may come up against if we give an option to turn this behavior off.

I would recommend doing it, as it'll make the CSS a lot more enjoyable to maintain. I would also recommend keeping the compiled CSS in the repository as to not make it harder for newbs.

453,2011-12-13 07:42:54,"A couple of things to consider: 
1. As Scott mentioned, switching to either SCSS or LESS adds to the contribution learning curve.
2. Our core devs who handle the CSS don't have experience with either LESS or SCSS, and while they both represent strict supersets of CSS using them properly (eg, avoiding overeager nesting) takes time/experience. @toddparker @Wilto and @scottjehl will have to make a determination here.
3. Adding an external dependency means another source of possible upstream issues. In any case we're actually adding _two_ dependencies in the form of a runtime and the relevant package/library. 
4. The migration path is not obvious to me. If we make a concerted effort to migrate any of the CSS we run the risk of introducing bugs where no test coverage exists (ie visuals). It's entirely possible that a slow introduction with small migrations over time is feasible, most projects I've worked on that leveraged either tool did so from the start. Some more anecdotal evidence here would be helpful.

To be clear I have used and appreciate both tools, but unless CSS is falling down hard for us in more places than just the theme roller, where I see the most obvious benefit, it seems like more trouble than it's worth.

Ok, as I started this thing, I guess I should wade in.  

I completely understand where the core team are coming from on this. Switching all the CSS to SCSS etc was easy enough, but I've always had nagging doubts in my mind if I've converted everything correctly.  I think I've always managed to do a decent job as no one ever complained, but there is no 100% guarantee of the conversion being perfect. I did wonder about doing file to file comparisons, but that was never going to be perfect either.

I also get the argument about not having too many barriers to some developers, however I would say the barrier to SASS or LESS is a lot less now as more and more developers are starting to adopt them.  Now I'm a big fan of SASS, and quite vocal about it, but at the same time I'm not a believer in forcing techs onto people.  My personal opinion on why SASS vs LESS is simply down to Compass.  For me it's always been about Compass and all the tools that provides. (Oh yeah, and I'm no fan of getting JavaScript to handle all the styling, but that's a different argument :))

Anyway, back to the point.  I can't see SASS or LESS being adopted into this project, for the good reasons that @johnbender has raised.  There is however clearly a call for this, so here's what I suggest. 
1. I pull my finger out and actually start maintaining my Compass plugin - https://github.com/pollingj/jQuery-Mobile-SASS
2. The core dev team point people in the direction of the plugin, maybe making it an official SASS / Compass plugin?
3. Whenever any changes are made to the CSS let me know and I'll get the necessary SASS stuff updated.  (To be honest this was always my biggest issue - having to start over again with the conversion).
4. Developers start contributing to the Compass plugin :)
5. If someone wants a LESS version, then they should just create a separate version, and again get the core dev team to point to it. Clearly the SASS version will be superior though ;)

So, lastly, apologies for letting my project slip so badly. Unfortunately I've not needed it myself for some time, so I've let it all slip.  (You know the story).

Thoughts?

Could I ask when you guys make a change to the CSS that you can drop me a quick email to give me a gentle prod and I'll get any necessary updates done.  It will be easier for me to keep up maintenance if I'm changing stuff in small amounts.

453,2013-01-04 02:34:58,"@toddparker or @paulirish - Any chance we could (re)-reopen and revisit this issue?

A large jQM project I've been working on over the last month or so presented the opportunity to leverage SCSS and Compass for code maintainability. During the theming process, I took it upon myself to convert a considerable amount of the base jQM structure and theme CSS into Compass mixins, switched the static image icons over to using font icons, added mixins for generating retina and non-retina sprite sheets, etc.

While this conversion process isn't yet complete, I think the work and insight so far could benefit the community quite extensively.

If the opportunity exists, I'd be willing to put in the time to get jQuery Mobile up and running on SCSS / Compass. I feel this is far too important an issue to not take action on.

There's still a TON of work to do before I would consider this to be even remotely close to completion:
-Finish re-processing the structure and theme .scss files from the /structure-processing and /theme-processing folders and replacing the CSS in the corresponding /sass/structure and /sass/theme folders
-Comparing the outputted SASS line by line to the original jQM CSS
-Verifying rule specificity
-Converting certain values such as border-radii or colors into global variables
-Converting the theming color variations (and widget states) into Compass color operations
-Documentation
-Adding Compass tasks to Grunt build

450,2011-09-15 13:48:56,"I like the idea of page event listeners, it's somehow the basic idea around haschange url routing.
It's also the only way to put our code in the right place and have it executed at the right time.

For instance, we may want to perform 'our things' (fetching data from the internet, client side rendering, etc) in the background, before page transitions, in order to speed things up.
However there are certain cases that require the page to be fully shown, because our javascript enhanced widgets (or google maps for that matter) don't work if the dom is hidden or with display:none.
The only way to achieve this behaviour is using page events.

So, I think that the current proposed solution (supporting parameters in the hash part of the url and using page events to access the pageUrl) is enough to play with dynamically generated pages.

450,2011-10-20 23:23:42,"@jblas - in jQM, I'd like to use a href like this:



When you click on this link, jQM should:
- make the querystring available somehow in the ""pagebeforeshow"" event
- render #basepage, with the complete url (#basepage?city=a&state=b), so that it is bookmarkable
- update the history, so the back-button works properly
- work on all browsers

The problem I see is inconsistent behavior on different browsers, especially when clicking multiple links with different query strings...

This also explains why there is no loading dialog after swiping (even when the connection is very slow and the next page takes some time to load).
Could it be that swiping detaches the click handlers somehow? Maybe the hero does not properly fire the necessary 'swipe completed' events? 
Does this info help? If not can you point me to the place in the code where this (swipe events and click event attachment/detachment) is handled so that I could investigate further? Also can you tell me if the click events (or similar) are detached when starting to swipe and attached afterwards?

394,2011-01-23 03:55:22,"@rolfanders - can you confirm this is still an issue with the latest because we've done a ton of navigation fixes:
http://jquerymobile.com/test/

We still don't have a Bada device to test so we need your help here. More specifically, when you click the back button, what happens? If it skips over all the jQuery Mobile pages that we're Ajax'd in and goes back to the previous page you went to before JQM, that means that your browser may not support hashchanges as steps in the history stack (like BB5 and Symbian). If that's the case, it's sort of a limitation of the browser that we can't work around. We're working on a feature test to see if hashes and history work and, if not, avoid the Ajax navigation (each link goes to a new page). That's about the best we can do.

I'm closing this because Bada's back button issues should be addressed by #853

The 2 lines of js in this allow you to make any listview sortable by adding data-sortable=""true"" to any listview and calls the refresh method after each update to ensure any dividers are properly updated. any string options on sortable can also be specified in the same way as jquery mobile options by doing data-[optionname]=""optionvalue"" on the element

Thanks for the URL.

@brunocoder the jQuery mobile panel currently does not support scrolling the panel separate from the page. to make the panel scroll separately you can use `-webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch` as for the scroll to the top this is intentional and not a bug.

8303,2015-10-08 20:42:16,"I won't lie, a modularized jquery-mobile would be ideal (e.g. https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/lodash-modularized), but I think there are some things that could be gained without going that far.
1.  Committing built assets to git is never good, agreed.  This is what [`prepublish` scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) + [.npmignore](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/developers#keeping-files-out-of-your-package) are used for.  These allow you to publish built assets to npm, ensuring a fresh build on publishing, without committing them to git or publishing files not needed for running.  I could try to find/put together a demonstration of its use if you are unfamiliar with it.
2. Publishing the necessary files to npm allows for custom task runners to perform custom builds of jquery-mobile assets coming in from npm (which is what you are hoping people do now?)
3. Publishing a built version of jquery-mobile to npm allows for shimming with https://github.com/thlorenz/browserify-shim.
4. The minor modifications mentioned in the npm post would afford quick require('jquery-mobile') without shimming or affecting anything else too much... although wouldn't promote a custom build.

If we can't get in touch with @gbraad I'm guessing it wouldn't be that much of a stretch to gain ownership of the namespace: https://www.npmjs.com/policies/disputes

I guess what I am primarily concerned with is that a built version of jquery-mobile gets published to npm (similar to the same, bundled + hotloaded http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js), for use by  taskrunners, shimming and dependency management with npm.

8299,2015-10-05 17:23:18,"I've worked with @gabrielschulhof on some issues related to `data-url` in the past (see #1383), but there's still a lingering issue here with ampersands and equals (see #3099). Specifically, if a URL query string parameter contains an embedded ampersand or equals sign, then `data-url` is not correctly encoded, and when the URL is updated, the embedded ampersand is interpreted as another parameter, when in fact it should be part of the value for the previous parameter.

I tried to put together this jsbin example showing the error:

http://output.jsbin.com/cononumoze

To use it, just type a string into the box and hit submit. The page will reload and show you the value of various page elements. It's best if you look at this with the Chrome DevTools open to the Network tab. If you enter a query with an ampersand, e.g. `Ren & Stimpy`, when you hit submit, you'll see it get submitted as `/cononumoze?q=ren+%26+stimpy`, which is correct. But when the page reloads, the `data-url` is set as `/cononumoze?q=ren+&+stimpy`, the URL bar is updated without the %26 encoding, and when one tries to parse the `q` parameter, you only get `Ren`. 

It's been a little challenging trying to get my head around this, but I'm pretty sure this is a problem with jQM not properly handling the embedded ampersand/equals. The guidance coming out of #1383 was that `data-url` should NOT be url encoded, and so it goes through a decode pass before being stored. But, I think the embedded ampersand/equals need to stay encoded. I'm not sure how to reliably do this.

This is a pretty critical bug for us, as we legitimately have query parameter values containing ampersands, and basically they are broken for navigation AFTER the original request.

With external panels `body` instead of `ui-page` is the containing block. Because we set `height: 99.9%` for `body` it has the height of the viewport, and so has the absolutely positioned panel which we make the same height as its container.
Looking into changing that to `min-height` has not much use since our pages are absolutely positioned as well so the `body` won't get the same height as the page.

@arschmitz - I think we talked about switching to `position: relative;` (and maybe set `absolute` during transitions?) for page at some point. If I remember correctly that had to do with an issue with external toolbars. Only if we make that change we can fix this with CSS. For now only with JS.

7870,2014-12-15 12:18:42,"The reason the textinput is getting focus is that, when you click on one of the divs underneath the textinput, the page gets the focus, so the popup's focus restriction handling kicks in, giving the first tabbable item inside the popup the focus - this is the textinput.

In 1.4.4 this did not happen because the popup itself was given a tabindex, so, when you clicked inside it, the focus restriction did not reassign focus because it's OK for the popup itself to gain focus.

I'm reluctant to reintroduce the tabindex to the popup for fear of causing the [Android blue focus flash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlYq65zjuj0) to reappear.

@glurak15 the solution is to give the popup a tabindex while it's open:

7805,2014-10-29 10:53:02,"@arschmitz I was going to suggest to @jackyon building a custom version of jQuery Mobile using the download builder. At that point I discovered a few problems:
1. The swipe events are inside events/touch, so if you wanna build without them, you need to uncheck events/touch, however this leads to the following problems: navigation.js (because of the vclick handler that adds the active button class) depends on vclick, so on events/touch. Thus, attempting to build without swipe will also remove vclick, which basically removes navigation and init. We might want to split swipe out of events/touch and maybe put it into events/swipe - although I haven't checked if swipe uses internal variables also used by other events inside events/touch.
2. navigation.js and pagecontainer depends on events.js, not events/touch, events/throttledresize, and events/navigate individually. Thus, we should also update that dependency, and eventually remove events.js entirely, because it's an empty module.

I just noticed there are also issues with navbars with button elements when the navbar is not in a toolbar. In that case the buttons get shadow and corner style.
Is button elements in navbars something we don't support? I didn't see anything about it in the documentation. Although it's meant for navigation (links) I can imagine people want to use a navbar instead of a controlgroup because of it's full width style and grid.

7478,2015-01-09 18:27:12,"@Ruffio so the bug here I think is what your describing with hash nav when we go back to the initial page we should be removing the hash completely yet it remains matching any subdirectory present ( or file name ).

So a few things here. First there is a warning in the docs i need to double check has not got lost in the move last year that you must always have a trailing `/` on links or else we will treat it as a file. So in the example of `http://www.noscience.dk/git` this is a bad link and so we are treating it as a file not a directory. 

In the case of  `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php#page2` and going to `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php#/gitindex.php` This is because all links are based on the current directory as the base because we need to know about any internal page navigation. Example the actual page loaded in both links is `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php` but the original page is `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php#page2` we need to know that you have navigated to just `http://www.noscience.dk/gitindex.php` because you are not using an id on your original page for your navigation ex `page1` its internal ""id"" ( or data-url ) is `#gitindex.php`.

I hope this has all been clear. If my understanding on the cases here is correct neither of the situations are actually a bug. /cc @gabrielschulhof

Which is that labels are expected to toggle the input when clicked so styling the legend as a label will lead people to believe it should be clickable. 

The reason we use the label for the button is accessibility related as well. I'd want to check with @dylanb here on other potential issues i'm not thinking of but a work around with this type of styling would be to proxy clicks on the legend to the label. not something we would be likely to do in the lib but maybe a demo.

This is not a documentation issue either. You use jQuery Mobile to enhance your links as buttons so you can expect that a script that used to work with your markup before enhancement might not work anymore after enhancement (ie. manipulation of your markup).

You can't expect us to document every single piece of code that won't work anymore. On a pot of paint you don't see a list of all colors that don't match with it either, right?

The fact that your code works with current version of jQuery Mobile is not because we fixed a bug, but because we don't generate a wrapper anymore during enhancement.

We certainly support installing via bower, but we do not support subsequently building via grunt. We turned to bower primarily for maintaining jQuery Mobile's own external dependencies, such as jQuery and some files from jQuery UI. We support making use of jQuery Mobile via bower the same way as we make use of jQuery Mobile's internal dependencies via bower. That is, we install the dependencies via bower, and then we use our own build process to integrate them.

1. Open http://jsfiddle.net/zm6kprsf/1/show/light/#/k9L6hpn8/1/show/light/ in your browser (this is a URL of the form http://domain/path1/#/path2, meaning that the page at path2 should be displayed in the end and the URL of path2 should show up in the location in the end)
2. Click on ""Page 2"", which is a link to an internal page

At this point, the location will display /path1/#page2 instead of /path2/#page2. This is bad, because opening an internal page should only change the hash, not the path.

Yes, the padding is on the container div, but the default font-size (at least in jQM 1.4) is applied to the `.ui-mini` class, which is what is on the container div -- so if one changes/overrides the font size for mini inputs (by declaring a different `font-size` for `.ui-mini`), it does impact the padding. (And the same is true for the left padding, which is on the input itself, even if you apply the font size to the input directly.)

We are planning on being spec-compliant wrt. hash handling so if someone wants to structure their hashes, for example by using what looks like a query string, (`#abc?def=ghi`) then they're gonna have to intervene in the page change process to ensure that the framework loads `#abc` and not `#abc?def=ghi`, right?

I guess when we do this, no extra work will be needed to get `#abc?def=ghi` to show up in the location, whereas now such extra work has to be done, because right now we strip the `?def=ghi` from the location when we set it - which is not to-spec.

So, in conclusion:
- 1.4.0
  1. Clicking `<a href=""#abc?def=ghi"">Go</a>` results in a location of `??????#abc` and in the framework looking for the page with id `abc`.
  2. If you want the resulting location to be `??????#abc?def=ghi` you have to do extra work - for example by assigning ```.jqmData(""url"", ""#abc?def=ghi"") on the destination page.
- 1.5.0 (or later, depending on when we get to it)
  1. Clicking `<a href=""#abc?def=ghi"">Go</a>` results in a location of `??????#abc?def=ghi` and in the framework looking for the page with id `abc?def=ghi`.
  2. If you want the framework to display page `#abc` you have to do extra work - for example by intercepting pagebeforechange and replacing the occurrences of `#abc?def=ghi` in the event data.

A deeplink to **index.html#foo/bar** will check the DOM for a page with `data-url = ""foo%2bar""`. If not in the DOM the page will be generated and transitioned to. 

When starting from a deeplink, JQM history will be reset to **index.html** so that page is also accessible as first page if needed. If starting from regular page, all stays as normal.

Then I talked about it with @JamesMGreene in Portland and he told me to look into istanbul. 

I don't know if one is better than the other, it seems to me like istanbul has a more active community but I may be wrong. 

Other factor of choice was the simplicity of putting this solution in place not requiring us to adapt any test or test runner. It was basically a matter of using grunt-qunit-istanbul as a drop in replacement for grunt-contrib-qunit.

That's just the page transition. See your test page without page transition: http://jsbin.com/aVoyejA/3
The markup of the toolbar is outside the page but it's treated as part of the page so it transitions together with the page. True persistent toolbars are typically used with position fixed. In that case the toolbar wouldn't transition together with the page. Closing as not a bug.

One thing that bug me out is the fact that the header need to be fixed to be ""truly"" persistent...
Fixed =/= persistent. I want the header to be persistent but do not want it to be fixed..

You are right - at the time of reading they did say that panel looks for data-role='page' div `If you want to use the same panel on multiple pages you can place the markup outside the page.`
Unfortunately this kind of markup is quite common with other js frameworks - backbone and the likes, which have one div to anchor and one inside of it which is being generated dynamically. Otherwise it's hard to control where elements being placed/attachedTo... So to your knowledge, is there any way i could  make the panel aware of inner `divs`?

Thanks for your post.

Setting a default padding for `ui-panel-inner` is indeed something we could reconsider. Same goes for using an opt-in class for panel shadow, to make it optional.

The rule for `ui-header-fixed` is to fix an issue on some Android versions where you would otherwise see a 1px jitter when scrolling.

The margin for `ui-title` is needed to make sure the absolute positioned left and right buttons in the header are not on top of the text. I agree the 30% left and right margin we set now is not always convenient, especially when you only use small icon-only buttons, or no buttons in the header at all. So this is something we want to look into.

What bug in popup widget do you mean. Can you test if you see it when testing with latest code and, if so, open a new ticket for it and provide a test page? See the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#issues) for our JS Bin template.

The Galaxy S II is stuck (""No update available"") at Android version 2.3.5. Please bear in mind that this manifestation on the Galaxy S II is one I submitted because I can repeat it at will, and I know you guys want that for a bug submittal. But there is a bigger bug I've seen on the Samsung Galaxy SII, SIII, Note II, HTC One X, and Google Nexus 4 (thus far of 13 Android test phones I have), where all my menu buttons can freeze from time to time. However, I cannot reproduce the issue at will, unfortunately, so I cannot submit it as a bug report to you.

As far as Galaxy phones, I have a Galaxy S, SII, SIII, S4, and Note II on my desk, all upgraded to latest Android OS they can run.

Is there a way you can look at my PhoneGap app if I send you the download link? With it, the general, bigger bug will manifest itself from time to time, but with no guarantees when. But the Galaxy S II-specific bug is 100% repeatable: If the user goes to certain scrollable screens (like my About or Help screens, for instance), they WILL get stuck on it ""forever"", with the navigation buttons animating and sounding, but not navigating to the target screen, until the user scrolls it all the way to the unscrolled position and then presses a button, at which time the app will navigate right away.

I believe the Galaxy S II-specific bug and the bigger bug are related.

Please let me know if you want me to send you the link for my Beta version app. I probably should send that to you in private, however, since the app is in Beta. If you have a Galaxy SII to run my app on, this would really help a lot to let you see this issue in action.

My Beta version app uses PhoneGap 2.9.0 and jQuery 1.9.1 and jQuery Mobile 1.3.1.

6485,2013-09-24 15:34:55,"All,

Just to clarify:
1. This problem exists only on a handful of devices, namely two that I know of: Samsung Galaxy S II and Galaxy Blaze. It is likely you will NOT see this issue on most phones, like the LG L3 Android 2.3.6 and HTC Desire S Android 2.3.5 phones for example, like you tried @uGoMobi. But the issue DOES exist.
2. I know fixed toolbars have some issues, with some caveats listed in your online documentation. However, the code example I provided doesn't bump up against those caveats, as this example is very, very simple. This means: fixed toolbars will not work whatsoever on Galaxy S II and Blaze devices in apps that have scrollable content on their screens, as the jQM code currently stands.

If this issue will not be fixed and/or is not fixable, I will have to either get rid of fixed toolbars in my app (not good, as many screens have a lot of reports-type content), or include special instructions for Galaxy S II and Blaze users to scroll their screens before pressing buttons. (That sounds awful just typing it here!)

Would any of you be willing to explain to me why this can't be fixed? I need to explain this to my management and my client.

Thanks,

Jack
",applejacko,uGoMobi
6485,2013-09-27 16:03:32,"@uGoMobi thanks for the explanation. 

Is there somewhere I can go to read about the details of this and dig deeper so I can understand it from a technical angle? You see, I have a bigger version of this bug: from time to time my jQM menus will freeze up, just completely cease to operate, even on the newest phones like a Samsung Galaxy S4. But I can't seem to find any user interaction pattern about when and why this happens. As soon as it happens, I try to do the same user actions, but the freeze-up doesn't recur. It happens predominantly on Galaxy-line phones, but I've in rare cases seen it on other phones. It usually happens when the app is being foregrounded, or with the app already in the foreground and the phone is awakened.

I can't post it as a bug with you, because I can't provide a code sample that will make it happen in a repeatable manner. I believe the ""general"" bug I'm describing here and the ""specific"" bug I described and for which I posted the code sample above with the Galaxy S II are related, but I can't 100% say for sure. If I understood the Specific Bug better, I might be able to debug and better understand the General Bug. 

The main page of my app, one place I see the freeze-ups, has no fixed elements, other than the data-position=""fixed"" on the toolbars. All the other HTML has default static positioning. I mention this because using fixed position elements is warned against in a caveat in your documentation. I don't violate that caveat.

If there's any way you can help me out, I'd appreciate it. This General Bug is really troubling, especially since it happens (1) intermittently and (2) on the newest phones on the market.

I appreciate all your help and attention.

Rather than patch jQuery Mobile, something I found that works is to tell jQM to add the 'needsclick' class to the panel so that fastclick will skip over it. You can do this by passing it in the options hash when you build your panel:

The reason why I didn't see the `ui-corner-all` class is because I looked at a navbar where the anchor elements didn't have `data-role=""button""`. This data- attribute is not needed in navbars but adding it shouldn't cause a problem. This has already been fixed by the changes @gabrielschulhof made to buttonMarkup().

A destination file name like ""jquery.mobile.svg.css"" might be a bit confusing though. Like it only contains the icon CSS. Suggestions?

The default CSS is already working fine, because we only added an @import rule. The additional files work the same, the destination files with @import rules are on the repo. We have to build those CSS files (unminified and minified) and add them to the ZIP and CDN.

I think we also have to include the icon source files (unminified and minified) in the ZIP and upload the to the CDN. That means another 8 files :/

Things you could have a look at:
- The controlgroup inside the popup does not enhance correctly. Clueless as to what to do here.
- I have not added tests for dynamically adding/removing columns.
- On refresh, I'm currently re-setting the table to `default`, eg. any toggle locks set by the user when hiding/showing are reset. The alternative would be to display the new rows/columns in the last `state` the table was in = the refreshed table should maintain hidden/shown columns set by the user when toggling. First way is easier to set.
- Destroy still needs to remove the toggle popup
- If the user supplies pre-enhanced markup (`option enhanced`), how to we indentify elements, such as the toggle popup? I'm now using a `option referenceClass` but I hope you have a better idea...

I am currently writing the 4th edition of my jQuery Mobile book (http://store.elated.com/) to cover 1.4, so I want to make sure I have this right! Can you confirm that the following points are correct please?

From 1.4 onward:
- The `button()` widget plugin is designed to enhance _only_ `<input>` buttons.
- The `buttonMarkup()` function is a stand-alone function that is designed to enhance `<button>` elements and link-based buttons. It is the only function of this type in jQuery Mobile - all other widgets (checkboxes, radio buttons, collapsibles etc) are true widget plugins.
- You can enhance a `<button>` element or link-based button manually by calling `buttonMarkup()` with an optional object containing the options to set on the button, e.g. `$('el').buttonMarkup( { corners: false } );`.
- You can also call `buttonMarkup()` on an already-enhanced `<button>` element or link-based button to change the button's options, e.g. `$('el').buttonMarkup( { corners: false } );`.
- To set options when initialising a _widget_ manually - such as an `<input>` button - you can pass an options object to the plugin, e.g. `$('el').button( { corners: false } );`
- You are _not_ supposed to call a widget plugin on an already-initialised widget to _change_ its options - for example `$('el').button( { corners: false } );` (although this often seems to work OK?).
- To set options on an already-initialised widget, the _correct_ way is now to call the `option` plugin method, e.g. `$('el').button('option', 'corners', false)`. However there are still some issues with the `option` method and some widget types (e.g. issue #6163).

Is that all correct?

BTW I think this issue (#6163) also applies to non-native selects:

If an element of argument is null or it does not support native function(getAttribute), That method will make errors.

Here's the short answer. CSS3 Media Query support is broader than matchMedia support (IE9 has no matchMedia for example, yet it supports CSS3 media queries). This is why we (I) typically include this polyfill in responsive sites. Once included, you can test whether media queries are actually supported or not by running the following query:



To clarify, `only` is a media-query specific feature, while `all` is simply all media types, so this will return true if media queries are supported, and false if not.

Hope that helps!

Thanks for reporting the issue.

For 1.4 we are working on reducing the markup we generate for buttons, including the ones in listviews. As a result the anchor element in the list item will get the button classes, including the active state class. This resolves this issue.
It also means we can remove the code that was added (cb54f03) to fix the same issue we had with popups (#4611).

The `ui-btn-active` class is removed when the process of opening the panel is finished, so there is no need to use a timeout here.
The 300ms timeout we use in the popup widget was not part of the fix for #4611, but was added earlier (e612aa8). I am not completely sure why we choose to use a timeout.
@gabrielschulhof can't we remove the active state class on `popupafteropen`?

Thanks for this suggestion. I agree it would be nice if we could leave this up to the developer.

Downside of your solution is that it uses JS to add a class, while we are actually working on reducing this in 1.4 to improve performance. Another problem is the `:not()` selector which isn't supported on IE8. Media queries aren't supported either on IE8, but when people use a polyfill like Respond.js they probably expect things to work.

What I have in mind for field containers is to do the responsiveness the other way around and use class `ui-responsive`, the same way as we do for responsive grids. The labels and form elements sit next to eachother by default and we use the following CSS to stack them at small screens:



Or maybe also `.ui-responsive .ui-field-contain` so you only have to add the `ui-responsive` class to the form container and not each field container in the form.

The rule to apply this at all viewport widths for field containers in popups can be done the same way. That would resolve the problem you described, because you can just omit class `ui-responsive`.
Using an opt-in class and doing it the other way around also makes it a lot easier if you want to use a different breakpoint. Obvious downside is that you have to add that class to your markup if you want things to stay the same as they are now.

Sorry, was busy all week and I know why I did not set back `hidden/visible` - sure kept me busy....  I think it should be fixed now.

Short comments:
- in `table.columntoggle.js` checking for `o.mode === ""columntoggle""` will always pass when no mode is set on the table, because it's then being set by the `prototype.options.mode = ""columntoggle""`. In Unit tests, this made the first table without anything set also pass into columntoggle and getting a `ui-popup-container`
- in `table.columntoggle.js`, the `change-listener` on the popup bubbles. I think this is why my test failed, because bubbling with setting a class just resets the class, but when alternating `setAttribute/removeAttribute`, the bubble will remove attributes which just had been set.
- in tests `table-core.js`  `10. The dialog should become visible when button is clicked`, the `headers` selector also selected cells from `tbody`. Plus selecting the first  `input` on  `ui-popup-container` resulted in multiple inputs being in the selector, because the plain test-table also having columntoggle set and getting a popover.

I'm not totally sold on attributes vs. adding/removing classes to lock/unlock, but for now I hope it's ok (also [jsperf](http://jsperf.com/addclass-vs-attr-vs-setattribute))

Thanks for the cordial response, I would agree that a refresh method would be helpful, but it also seems that approaches similar to what I have suggested have already been implemented in this and other jQuery Mobile widgets. For example, the very next event binding:



Also, the popup widget uses a closeLinkSelector (""a:jqmData(rel='back')"") to bind the close events, as:



By your estimation, would these not also have a negative impact on performance? If they do, are they slated to be addressed in the future? From what I've seen, it seems that there's not really a standard way to treat close links in jQuery Mobile widgets, should there be?

Could you also expound on why the jQuery ""on"" method with a selector vs a jQuery object has a negative impact on performance? From what I understand of the ""on"" function, the exact opposite should be true, since calling it with a selector results in a single delegated event handler.

Thanks very much!

5927,2013-05-03 11:28:15,"@tschettler 

Here is a [jsPerf test](http://jsperf.com/delegated-vs-object/4) that shows the difference (thanks @gabrielschulhof for setting up the test!).

What we test here is the processing time; the responsiveness. The test shows that our current code is much faster than the code from your PR.
It's not very likely that there are many close links in a panel, otherwise we should also consider the difference in attaching time. Your code probably results in a faster startup.

Re: a standard way to treat close links. For 1.4/1.5 we are focussing on improving performance and reviewing all widgets. In widgets where we treat close links differently we can look into doing it the same way as we do for panels.
However, performance is not the only thing we have to look at. For example, if the issue you reported couldn't be fixed with a refresh method we should have merged your PR. So there might never be one standard way.

Good point about the next event binding in the `_bindCloseEvents` function in the panel widget. We should look into improving that when we review the panel widget.

Thanks!
",jaspermdegroot,gabrielschulhof
5927,2013-05-03 14:31:02,"Thanks for the response and for posting the benchmarks @uGoMobi! This benchmark does cover one dimension of the performance, but the other would be to consider using a refresh method on the panel to rebind the event when an item is added. Here's a benchmark for that as well:
http://jsperf.com/delegated-vs-object/7

The performance would obviously degrade for the selector method, as it would require rebinding. This does not include the overhead to perform the other functions in a panel refresh. In my case, I'm using a template to build a list of items within the panel, each with a data-rel=close attribute. This list is updated based on other elements in the UI. I would face a performance penalty if I were to call a refresh on the panel every time the list gets updated. I can see how it would be helpful if there were UI enhancements that needed to be made, but it seems like overkill to call it just to rebind the close event.

The only other option for me would be to not use close buttons and call close on the panel after any of the items are clicked. This is a mediocre workaround at best, I'd prefer to use the semantics of JQM to indicate that these items should close the panel. It seems the best recourse for me may be to use my own custom version of jQuery Mobile for now. I'll revisit it once there is a refresh method to test.

3. In testHelper's navReset method, unset the navigator's ignoreInitialHashChange flag, because webkit consolidates the popstate resulting from setting location.hash inside navReset with the initial popstate event it fires.

This should unify the startup event sequence between FF and Webkit. That is, in webkit we no longer have a superfluous call to changePage resulting in 3 pagebeforechange events being fired on initial page load.

5784,2013-03-19 00:50:19,"Hello, All.

I'll try to propose a way of lazy jQM widgets initialization to improve Web App's launching time. I think, @gabrielschulhof told jQM team about my PR last week, so I think you can guess what I'll suggest to you. 
My team's idea is as follows.

If a user makes a jQM javascript file including all of widgets(example: jquery.mobile-1.3.0.js) and adds it on a Web App's HTML page, and a Web browser loads the javascript file, All of jQM widgets' $.widget() methods are compiled and executed first. 
In short, regardless of what widgets are defined on a Web App's HTML page, all widgets are loaded and initialized first. 
All widgets also call the bind method as below, when ""pagecreate"" event is fired,



and then, enhanceWithin method calls enhance method as below and enhance method eventually calls _createWidget method and each widget's _create method. So, all widgets are loaded and initialized first, after a Web browser loads the javascript file.



So, my team thought that we should find what widgets are used on a Web App's HTML page to load and initialize essential jQM widgets. And my team developed some methods and modified some codes in each widget with two processes as follows.
1. My team stored $.widget() method call in a variable, so that JS engine can not call(compile and execute) the $.widget() method.
   
   // Before
   (function( $, undefined ) {
       $.widget( ""mobile.widgetname"", $.mobile.widget, { ... } );
   })( jQuery ); 
   
   // After
   (function( $, undefined ) {
       var widgetRegister = function () { 
                                              $.widget( ""mobile.dialog"", $.mobile.widget, { ... } ) };
       ...
       // Store widget's body method using a new method - addWidgetRegister.
       $.mobile.addWidgetRegister( widgetName, widgetRegister );
   })( jQuery ); 
2. My team updated enhanceWithin method to load and initialize essential widgets on a Web App's HTML page.
   
   // Updated enhanceWithin method
   enhanceWithin: function( target, useKeepNative, selector, widgetName, istarget ) {
       // check what widgets are needed on a Web App.
       var $targets = istarget ? $( target ) :  $( selector, $( target ));
       if ( $targets.length ) {
           ...
           $.mobile[widgetName].prototype.enhance( $targets, useKeepNative );
       }
   }
- Tests : The code has been tested on several jQM widgets using qunit.js.
- Modified code is followed the jQuery Core Style guide.
- Scope : Performance improvement.

The field container issue as you describe it has not to do with moving the popup contents, but is something we do on purpose.
We use a media query (min-width 28em) to adjust the label position and input width in field containers on wider screens. However, media queries are always based on the viewport and don't tell us anything about the width of the popup. So a small popup on a wide screen would get an even smaller input and the label in front of it. Because that is unwanted we override the field container CSS and set the input width to 100%.

When performing a navigate event during startup (such as during a `$( document ).ready( function() {} );` handler, the hash is being set and the history stack is increased before Webkit's initial popstate event happens. Thus, the [conditions](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/64030496e3d13fea0d3c4d24bba1ed8c808f1e14/js/navigation/navigator.js#L185-L194) for ignoring the initial popstate event are no longer met since, at the very least, the length of the history stack is no longer 1.

So, I suspect that this, in turn, causes nav to add an extra item to the history stack which is also a dialogHashKey item, but the stack no longer reflects the state of browser history (because the browser history only has one such item), so, when the user goes back, nav thinks that it can go back another entry to skip past the dialogHashKey states, however, since there is no other entry in the browser history, it ends up going back twice.

I saw that #5466 PR was closed by @gabrielschulhof a few days ago. Thanks so much Gabriel. :)
And there are many lines using jqmData() so my team rechecked them what lines could be changed with get/setAttribute. As a result, the committed codes are the same as #5466.

But some other jqmData method calls return true or false value, so my team thought that it would be better to make a new function including get/setAttribute to handle that case.
@gabrielschulhof, you made getAttrFixed() on buttonMarkup.js, so what do you think that we will define getAttrFixed() in global area and use it in other places? If you agree with my idea, we can upgrade more codes to improve performance.

Well, we see at least two different issues now.

1) If I have a close X icon on the popup, then it pushes the textarea to the side ( left or right, depending on the location of the close icon.

2) The Android 4.0 issue with duplicate text fields, causing all sorts of nasty corner and size problems. This only happens when you tap on the field, thus focusing on it. Until then everything is fine, so it indeed looks like the aformentioned Android bug.

Now, I am going to try the CSS trick.

5706,2013-02-27 21:52:55,"@vkammerer I get what you mean now. Sorry I thought that you could not lose focus on a previously focused input filed inside a a popup. Yes, it seems that the only way to lose focus on an input field inside a popup is to click/tap inside another input field and get that new one into focus. So if this is what you meant, then I can reproduce :-) 

@uGoMobi Is that something that we can look at? Outside of popups, tapping/clicking outside of a previously selected (in focus) input field, tapping/clicking outside of that input field will cause it not to be in focus anymore. However, inside the popup, this is not happening. So if you have tapped/clicked inside a form element inside a popup, clicking outside of that form element in the popup will not allow this input field to lose focus (except if you click inside another form element on the popup, but then the problem is just passed to another form element, and so not resolved)

We are not only applying a single colour, as the colour is applied after an ajax transaction has been completed to keep the user informed of the result/status of changes they make in a form.

The change isn't literally made when the page is first loaded... that was simply done to demonstrate the situation with as little code as possible.

We use a stack of views/macros which are displayed based on changes the users makes throughout the form, in order to allow a complete workflow without any need for refreshing. Each macro is paired with its own JS, so the number of places this may be done (and may require browser detection to select the parent) would be a fairly large number.

At this stage I will probably just be adding a function to the shared JS to allow this to be done with as little code duplication as possible, but in terms of simplicity for your users, I think the previous way was much more straightforward (keeping with the syntax of normal jQuery). I also think the user should be able to use selectors based on the code they actually write, rather than the code jQuery mobile generates.

In any case, thanks for your fast reply.

3. Close the panel.
4. Click on any button that opens a panel.

At this point, you can no longer open any panel until the page is reloaded. The reason for this is that during panel close, the animationComplete handler is never called, and so the .jqmData( ""panel"" ) remains set for the page.

The closing animation is very abrupt - much less smooth than the opening animation. I'm not sure if that has something to do with the failure to call the animationComplete handler.

Interestingly, as @uGoMobi pointed out, the panels worked just fine in the old documentation: http://view.jquerymobile.com/old-docs/docs/panels/index.html. Thus, it may be some styling issue.

Unfortunately, the test Android app I created for this issue is still showing the same performance lag with ICS os.  The app is pointing to the latest jQuery Mobile js and css like test page presented with this issue.  Using hardware acceleration in the Android manifest made no difference for the varying panel show times( 3 to 10 seconds today).  It did affect any smooth transitions.

I have finally had some time to work on the filter widget. I took the version in the ""next"" branch and made a few admendments.

Demo here: [filter widget](http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/filter/demo.html)

Comments:
- I did not change much except for the `children()` selector
- I have replaced the wrapping `<form>` because I'm often stuck wanting to use a filter inside a larger form and the form is never submitted anyway. So now it's a plain textinput wrapped in a `<div>`
- the filter can be used on `listview`, `select`, `table`, `controlgroup` or any element containing children to filter using the `data-itemSelector` attribute (must be a class)
- this also allows to use one filter for multiple datasets and filter anything containing text or filtertext
- I also added `data-target` (must be a class) to place the filter somewhere on the page vs the default behavior

Some Questions:
1. I also adapted the Qunit tests from the [listview](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/next/tests/integration/listview/listview_core.js) widget. Should I add tests for select, table, controlgroup, random as well? 
2. I'm having trouble with one test [""`Custom filterCallback should cause iteration on all list elements`""](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/next/tests/integration/listview/listview_core.js#L657), where my `_refreshCornersCount` is stuck at 2, so the test never fires although it would pass. Who can I ask for help?
3. I still need to update the CSS (not much to do I think). I see 2 icons on the right side of search elements quite often now (delete + search). Give it a try?

I can confirm the issue if rangeslider is the only selected component. With all components selected rangeslider the problem was gone.

@gseguin 

Because in the custom build the textinput comes after the (range)slider CSS the inputs are broken if the rangeslider is wrapped in a field container. Can we make sure the CSS in the custom build is in the same order as the normal build or do we have to increase the level of specificity of selectors to avoid this issue?

Then the new jqm release is tested fully for the first time. if no issues found at that time, we build other functionality on top of adopting the rc release.  else we would have reported the issue and potentially backed out of the rc release. but once we accept the rc release, we add functionality to the app and the sprints make it to production. no more turning back and then rc has to be in a cdn supporting https. so we gamble a bit -- put a lot of trust in you guys :-)

we can debate smaller files versus cdn. both have benefits. cdn's advantage being that the device may already have the file in browser cache. Downside is more to ""compile"".

To address why we can't test locally. It is not that we cannot.  It is because we take advantage of the new release, else no good reason to go there. And we must be able to go to production with new functionality or bug fixes. Yes, we can branch but branching has to be avoided as far as possible (in my opinion anyhow).

This may sound selfish, but to have rc and on in a cdn supporting https helps us (but will also give you better and more timely test feedback.)

The swipe gestures on kitkat fail for a completely different reason to other versions of android.
On kitkat only if you do a swipe gesture the following sequence of events are fired.
1. touchstart
2. touchmove
3. touchcancel (should be touchend)

Then if you tap once before a swipe the correct sequence of events are fired. 
1. touchstart
2. touchmove
3. touchend

So to overcome this kitkat bug I link the touchcancel to touchend for swipe events.

In addition to @gabrielschulhof his comment...

In previous versions the JS applied those corner classes. For performance we changed this to having the JS only apply the `ui-corner-all` or `ui-btn-corner-all` class. In the CSS we added rules to make child elements inherit the `border-radius` for the applicable corners.

If you used those classes for other elements you have to add them to your custom CSS. Note that you don't need the `-moz` prefixed property anymore. Two examples with the default radius of .6em:

Yes, my team did all of the unit test twice and all test cases are passed. Also my team verified all of jQuery Mobile widgets and Tizen widgets apparently. :) 

@gabrielschulhof and @arschmitz, 
As you can guess, the codes I modified doesn't need to store cache data on jQuery.cache because the cases are just retrieve the DOM elementary's attribute. Hence, my team thought that we could use JS API.  As you can see the jQuery codes, jQuery.fn.extend.data() and jQuery.data() functions' call stacks are deep and do many things. Hence, the methods' call time are much longer. After my team adapted the codes on real devices using WebKit based browsers and analyzed launching time in detail with WebKit source code, we got a big improvement from the test.

@arschmitz,
My team check getAttribute() API on IE browser. It works OK. Also some of the modules in jQuery Mobile use setAttribute() JS API. I think that setAttribute() is the same case.

I was thinking of using the dismiss modal here. Meaning, a swipe on page content/toolbars will only close the panel if option dismissible is set to `true` as well. Or do you think it's better to keep it simple and make a swipe on content/toolbars always close the panel as long as option `swipeClose` is `true`?

One of the advantages would be that you can hide the dismiss modal on larger (desktop) screens with a media query. Because our swipe event also works with mouse, text selection for example triggers swipe.

Also, should we make an exception for overlay mode, since the content/toolbars stay in place?

1. This has been fixed. See http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/panels/panel-nav-form-fixed.html and http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/panels/panel-nav-form.html
2. This is downside of page and panel scroll together.

All labels are aligned with the top of the form element. I think this is a matter of personal preference.

If we would want to change this we run into the following issues:
- We don't know if the label is next to a mini sized element or not
- Labels have font-size 16px while text inputs have font-size 14px and mini sized form buttons 12.5px
- Vertical alignment of text in form elements can be different across browsers

I think we should leave it up to the developer to align the label differently with custom CSS and close this ticket as won't fix.

One more note on link bindings.

I've talked with @gabrielschulhof about this but we can pretty easily setup `$.mobile.navigate` to pass arguments through when it triggers the navigate event so we can remove the `$.mobile.changePage` calls from our link bindings and make them an optional module.

Obviously that has implications for the ""fetch links"" in that they would just be links with a simple binding to trigger a navigate with some special options possibly.

Android is extremely buggy when it comes to combinations of elements with position fixed and elements with position absolute. Unfortunately there is nothing much we can do about it.

5387,2013-01-05 21:16:16,"This may actually be a bug in jQuery core. We call $form.serialize() to acquire all the form data, and jQuery filters `<input type=""submit"" name=""theName"" value=""theValue></input>` out of the form data. Now, this may be intentional, because inputs of type submit are not part of the form data unless clicked. So, we may have to manually add the clicked input of type submit to the form data in addition to calling serialize.

The reason it works with a jQM-enhanced button is that jQM temporarily replaces the button with an input of type hidden, but only when it's clicked.

We need to ascertain, likely with the help of @dmethvin whether my above thinking is indeed the reason for the absence of ""submit"" from the list of input types serialized during $.fn.serialize().

You can create two JS Bin test pages and link those to eachother. Anyway, I tested your pages and noticed the issue.

In your test case you set `data-url=""gallery""` for the second page in the multipage template and no `id` attribute. This use to work, but this is broken now. If you add `id=""gallery""` you will see it works.

as far as I understand, starting from 1.2.1, jQM will support parameters in the hash part of the url natively (see the discussion in #5085).

However, it seems that parameters get stripped from the url when they're used in an anchor and, as a result, the url is not bookmarkable.

As @johnbender suggested, I'm opening another issue to address this problem.

You are also correct the $(""#popupPanel"").popup('close'); - code works correctly when It is entered into the Firebug console. Type the code in the page closes and I stay on Page 2.

However, when I click any of the 3 buttons on the popupPanel the panel closes and I am sent back to Page one.  The 3 buttons all have $(""#popupPanel"").popup('close'); attached to them to close the window (they are straight from the sample jQuery Mobile docs).

I am running Firefox on Windows 7.

I cannot figure out how to have a button on a popup panel that I can click and have it do something and also close the panel.  Note, if I have 3 or 4 pages in the DOM when I click a button that has $(""#popupPanel"").popup('close'); on it, Firefox backs up through ALL of the pages.  I just figured having one extra page in my example was enough to see the effect.

Subject: Re: [jquery-mobile] popup panel close causes you to go back in history (more than one page) on firefox (#5227)

I have performed the following steps and am unable to reproduce this with Firefox 16.0.2 on Fedora 15:
1.  Go to http://jsbin.com/edajuw/1
2.  Enable firebug, go to the console tab, and reload the page if necessary
3.  Click ""Goto Page 2""
4.  Click ""Open Panel""
5.  Type $(""#popupPanel"").popup('close'); into the firebug console and hit Enter.

At this point, the panel closes, and you are returned to Page 2, as expected.

If you are still experiencing this issue, please do the followings:
1.  Review the jsbin at http://jsbin.com/edajuw/1/edit to make sure I have created it correctly, and if not, please make whatever corrections are necessary, and refer to the resulting URL in this issue thread.
2.  Review the steps I have performed above, and if I have made a mistake while attempting to reproduce the bug, please submit a similar list of steps I am to perform on the above-mentioned corrected jsbin so as to reproduce this bug.

5224,2012-10-30 12:05:57,"@Alain-Lavoie 

The issue happens because `data-rel=""back""` is missing in the link of the large cancel button in @jerone his fiddle. See ""Closing dialogs"" here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dialog/index.html

The back button on pageTwo is dynamically created. When you don't use `data-rel=""back""` on the link that brings you back from dialogThree (which is also a page) to pageTwo it adds an item to the history stack. That's why the back button on pageTwo then requires two clicks to actually bring you back to pageOne.
The active state is removed from a (back) button on the `pagehide` event. On the first click you stay on the same page, so this event doesn't fire and the button keeps the active state.

I added `data-rel=""back""` and then everything works as expected: http://jsfiddle.net/jEesE/6/

I have to agree, on some browsers the slider is less responsive.
People keep trying again when the slider reacts slow, with frustrating results.

Tested it on Samsung Galaxy S3 (default browser -> _slow_, Firefox -> _medium_, Chrome -> _fast_, Opera -> _medium_), Samsung Galaxy Mini (default browser -> _slow_), Experia Arc S (default browser -> _slow_), iPhone 4 & 5 (Safari -> _medium_) and iPad 2 (Safari -> _fast_).

In my opinion, in the `refresh` method some calculations could be removed outside or done only at the beginning when the user presses the handle.

5198,2012-12-16 14:06:16,"This is an issue we have to look into.

Test case: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/listviews/listview-filter-autocomplete.html

Steps to reproduce: Enter first 3 characters of a city name. Click on the clear button or view source button.
Because the ""change"" event is fired after you blur the input, the first click on one of those buttons triggers that event. Only after you click a second time the input field will be cleared or source view popup will be opened.
However, if we wouldn't bind to ""change"" the list wouldn't be updated when you click on the clear button.

[Now](a743616) we also bind to the ""input"" event to fix problems with multibyte characters (e.g. Japanese), the problem became a bit worse.  When you enter a character both ""keyup"" and ""input"" fire and in the test case this means two Ajax calls. I don't think the ""input"" event is supported by all browsers that we support, so we can't just drop ""keyup"".

Regarding pasting text which @arschmitz mentioned: Maybe we can resolve this by binding to ""paste"" and ""cut"" events, but again browser support might be a problem. And we would still need ""change"" to update the list when the clear button is clicked, unless we make this trigger a ""clear"" event or something.

5173,2012-10-15 17:02:50,"In the first (and current) version of the framework, we used a combination of data attributes and JS feature testing to ensure enhancements – both JS and CSS – were not applied in unqualified environments. This allowed us to leave C-Grade environments un-enhanced, and usable, both visually and behaviorally. The gist of it was we'd apply a data attribute to an element, say `data-role=listview`, and in JS, we'd run our baseline feature qualification of CSS3 Media Query support, and in supporting environments, we'd add classes to that element that the CSS would style (and also add behavior with JS at that point too).

Fortunately, we've found better ways to qualify CSS application since then. One simple way is to just qualify the CSS itself by ensuring it is always wrapped  in an inline media query (or a `media` attribute on the `link` element). `@media only all` is a media query we can use to say, ""if media queries are supported,"" within CSS itself:



or...



If we take that further, we would ideally have styles that are written against markup attributes that are already present when the markup is delivered, rather than having to wait for them to be added through JS. This is typical of custom web development patterns, but has been harder for us to do in a framework setting due to the complexity of some of the markup our components use.

This should be addressed in a couple of ways: both by simplifying the markup for our components so that they're easier to serve directly from the server-side, and considering choosing either classes or data attributes as our mechanism for configuring widgets - but not both. And then styling against one or the other from the start.

@baansport Aldo Lugo created a jQM FB style slide nav, but it's far from perfect.. see here:
http://blog.aldomatic.com/facebook-style-slide-out-menu-in-jquery-mobile/

- Work out ""Push Left"" first (This should also be the default behaviour).
- Push the page Top Bar as well.
- Disable scrolling of the pushed page.
- Enable scrolling within the Slide Nav (For nav's with a lot of menu items).
- 100% Height on Slide Nav.
- Enable Swipe left/right events to open/close nav. (See Aldo's demo, he implemented this).
- While nav is open, clicking somewhere on the pushed page should close the nav again.

This is caused by an iOS3 bug that we can't fix. 
You can resolve the problem by setting an adjusted border-radius for mini buttons in your CSS. The issue only occurs when the border-radius is more than half the height of the element.
See #4443 for more details.

BTW - I don't understand how you can see this issue on http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/buttons/buttons-inline.html. That page uses jQuery core 1.8.2 and iOS 3.x with jQuery core 1.8.x is C grade (no JS, plain HTML).

- Open an external document with all typical ""page"" properties, but a different visual treatment. 
- Update the URL using a known, null-value has (even in pushstate-supporting browsers) so that the dialog can be dismissed via the back button, but not reachable through a link.

Ahhh, you might be on to something there. The logon page where the issue is being encountered has a div that's position:fixed with some other styling in order to keep it stuck (vertically and horizontally) to the second of the screen.

Yes - the issue was originally raised on an S3 with my code and styling, and taking the position:fixed off the div makes the popup show on top of all other elements.

Your problem is simply solved by adding a fixed width to your `img` tag in the dynamic pop-up.
Currently your code does not have that and hence the pop-up doesn't know how wide the image is before it loads it.
This below CSS rule fixes it.  You can change the width to whatever you want.

I have updated my demo to the latest JQM (new page: [here](http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/tableview/demo.html) and pushed the commented code to my [tableview repo](https://github.com/frequent/tableview)).

This version is close to the version I'm currently using (with datatables). I have changed the custom select to native selects on my site, but for the new demo I changed native selects to popup, so you the widget now uses popup for the column toggles by default. I also JQM gridded the top and bottom wrappers.

There is a bunch of stuff in tableview which you probably don't need/want (filling the wrapper slots, auto adding a selectable-checkbox-column ...). I have labelled the js/css in the code, so you can just pick what you like. 

The tricky stuff also should more or less work - tricky being responsive columns with `multi-row table headers` (more than two will be too difficult to toggle) and table header cells usually having `non-JQM classes` in which case the original responsive example doesn't work.

What I haven't added yet is a wrapper-div around the table and slot elements. Without this, the plugin will run into trouble if  more than one tableview is in the DOM. I also still need to add the code for the select (vs popup) toggle menu and get the zebra function to work (odd/even theming table rows).

@MauriceG and I already had a nice discussion about making it possible to set a default icon for listviews. See #4582.

I think we should keep things simple for users and not add new options if not really necessary. So I suggest to stick to one option ""icon"" with the following possibilities:

default = ""arrow-r""
1. [global] override the default for all listviews by using the `$.mobile` object
2. [UL/OL] override the default or global with `data-icon` on a listview _OR_ with the option `icon` if that listview is created programmatically
3. [LI] override any of the above for a list item with `data-icon` on that specific list item

This isn't a documented feature and hence you are having issues. I can see that there is an issue with the search filter bar being rendered for each UL it has as a child regardless of whether  As for the filtering, the search input will filter on all text within an `li` and hence in your example you get the first 2 collapsible DIVs returning when you type in ""nest"" for example.  What you could do there is run a custom `filterCallback` function to return only the collapsible DIVs you want.  

I have tried to provide a working test case on the JSBin that Jasper @uGoMobi kindly setup but was unable to get it to override the listview.filter successfully without messing with original core code.  What I've ended up doing is a rather hacky solution is to make a ""cache"" of element ID's which have been parsed to create a search-filter and choose not to re-markup the input if already exists in the ""cache"".  
Naturally you need to make sure that you give each of your lists which nest others a unique id.

You can see the file and the changes here [https://github.com/robschmuecker/jquery-mobile/compare/fix-5016](https://github.com/robschmuecker/jquery-mobile/compare/fix-5016)  I'm not certain that this is the ideal way to deal with this case but have tested and it works fine in IE7+ and Webkit.  If this is not something which will work for you I would go down the route of ""hiding"" the extra search-filters via CSS.

As you can also see by this JSBin [http://jsbin.com/uwaxaj/9/edit](http://jsbin.com/uwaxaj/9/edit) it only is affected by lists nested within itself.

5016,2012-09-20 18:46:27,"Hi All,

As @uGoMobi mentioned there was an event bubbling twice, a ""parent"" list which had `data-filter=""true""` would receive not only it's own `listviewcreate` event and hence insert a search bar before it's own list but would also be notified of any `listviewcreate` of it's children so would prepend another search bar for each child listview.

I have taken the UUID of the listview to allow the listview.filter to check if it's already present in the dom and hence not re-add itself.  This means I have added a new data-attribute in the form of 

`.attr( ""data-"" + $.mobile.ns + ""list-id"", listview.uuid )`

I'm not 100% certain whether this is the best way but certainly more elegant than my previous solution due to the fact that we are not adding any more overhead into memory but rather checking on-the-fly for the existence of a previous instantiation of the list and hence filter input.  I am not sure how if at all possible it could be to prevent the subsequent event bubbling from happening on the listview with nested listviews?

I have updated the `js/listview.filter.js` and added a proof-of-concept file to prove it now works with ""unlimited"" nesting at `issues/test-5016.html` in my latest commit at [https://github.com/robschmuecker/jquery-mobile/commit/50aecbad6d6cf0faf1046c5ffe656c3ab9d12d18](https://github.com/robschmuecker/jquery-mobile/commit/50aecbad6d6cf0faf1046c5ffe656c3ab9d12d18)

please have a look and if you're happy with the fix I can write a test-case before putting a PR together.

Thanks,

R.

@toddparker - Is applying the active state to all buttons, regardless of markup, something we can add for 1.3?
",jaspermdegroot,toddparker
5009,2012-11-26 11:56:55,"After a discussion with @uGoMobi we've come up with two possible solutions for adding active states to those buttons (be they links or form elements) that will cause the browser to tear down all of jQM as it shows a page via an HTTP request.
1. The CSS-based approach: We create a new class (ui-btn-active-remove - naming is up for discussion, of course) that is a CSS transition which basically negates the modifications introduced by ui-btn-active, but does so after a while. We apply this class during nav's click handler, when we determine that following the link would result in HTTP navigation. A central sumbit handler similar to the click handler might have to be added so we can also deal with form buttons that have had ui-btn-active added to them. We identified several consequences with this approach:
   1. The source page might become littered with applications of the class ui-btn-active-remove if the user repeatedly navigates over HTTP, then returns to the jQM page containing the HTTP links. The presence of these classes would have no visual effect, but it would be ""unsightly"". We could clean up during the click handler with a $( "".ui-btn-active-remove"" ).removeClass( ""ui-btn-active-remove"" ) if that turns out not to be expensive. For browsers that do not support CSS transitions, the application of ui-btn-active-remove would have the effect of immediately removing the modifications applied by ui-btn-active, so for those browsers [this issue](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5009) would not be fixed.
   2. There might be bugs similar to the problems that prompted introduction of popup interruptible transitions. For example, there is a (Chrome) browser bug that was not filed whereby, when clicking an AJAX link from a popup that leads to another page and later returning to the page containing the popup, one would see the final stages of the popup's closing transition on the source page, even though the time interval during which the closing transition was supposed to complete is much shorter than the time spent on the page opened from the popup.
   3. The class ui-btn-active-remove might have to be themed, and we'll have to apply one of ui-btn-active-remove-[a-z] at the time of vclick.
   
   _This approach hinges on the fact that we can essentially achieve the effect of removing .ui-btn-active by adding the class .ui-btn-active-remove and, furthermore, defining ui-btn-active-remove in such a way that, where browsers support CSS transitions, the transition is used to achieve the effect of removing ui-btn-active, and where browsers do not support CSS-transitions, the basic properties of the ui-btn-active-remove class will have the effect of removing ui-btn-active._ @Wilto should be able to weigh in here.
2. The [unload](http://api.jquery.com/unload)-based approach (as @jerone suggested): During the central click routing in jquery.mobile.navigation.js we make the determination as to whether we should handle a link via AJAX or whether we should let the browser handle it the normal way. At this point, if the decision is to let the browser handle it, we could add a one-shot unload handler that would remove the active state added during the central vclick handler the same way as the hashchange handler would remove such an active state. We might also have to introduce a central submit handler so as to add this one-shot unload handler for submit buttons as well.
   
   The challenge with this approach is that we must test that the unload event works reliably on all our supported platforms.

I'm going to fix the test to make sure that it works with the understanding that we shouldn't be special casing IE10 for pretty much anything in our library (or at least until we have reason to). Once I hear back from @gabrielschulhof  (he's out of town I think) I'll then switch it over to `.oldIE`.

It would be nice to add some info in the docs `pushstate` section, showing an example of what URLs with and without pushState look like. It took me so forever to realize that:

while pushState shows:



Yes, it's in the text description that pushstate replaces the url, but I didn't realize how it actually works (and why my `parseUrl` always returned ""strange"" results.

4865,2012-08-23 16:12:55,"@frequent - this is a very cool idea. I really like the idea of just using data-type=""horizontal"" on the collapsible sets to make a tab. Two bits of feedback:
- I think these should default to not showing an icon, just like we do for the horizontal checks/radios. Maybe if you set the icons explicitly for the expanded/collapsed, we can show them but by default, not having icons leaves more room for text and makes these look more like tabs. 
- Since there isn't a physical connection between the header and content as there is in an accordion, I'd like to apply the active class to the expanded collapsible to show an on state.

Is this coded to handle any number of tabs (within reason)?
I also wonder if we should apply a content theme by default or just document that you should add this.

Maybe @uGoMobi can work with you to refine this a bit and we can try to land this for 1.3.
",toddparker,uGoMobi
4865,2012-08-24 07:12:17,"@toddparker 

Sounds good. I agree with the icons (need a lot of space, will try to remove) and content-theme (make an option). I have set it up for 4 tabs right now, but maybe it can be done like the navbar to wrap to multiple lines (checking). Active state should already by there. I might have overwritten the CSS to not show it (also checking).

I'm only ""white-belt"" in Github. So I set up a branch in my local repo, make my changes in there. Then do a normal pull-request?

4865,2012-09-03 15:41:28,"@uGoMobi - Ok. I will try that. I have the non-icon default working (based on radios). Looking at active state and 4+ tabs next. I guess the easiest way to do 4+ is to mimic the footer, which is also based on JQM grids, isn't it? If I can get it to work the tabs would ""break"" to two rows if more than 5 are used. Let see if I can get this to work.
",frequent,uGoMobi
4865,2012-09-10 19:29:37,"@uGoMobi, @toddparker: need your feedback on some points.

1) (done) - keep active class on active collaspibles
2) (done) - if not specified, tabs are without icons by default
3) (need input!) - **max number of tabs**: This is tricky... 5 is no problem, also breaking to multiple lines if more than 5 tabs (same as navbar). I have been fiddling with another approach  ([dummy](http://www.franckreich.de/p/test.html)), where I'm trying to get by without setting any width/min-width on the tabs and just expand depending on text size while breaking to multiple lines on smaller screens. I have pretty much tried all CSS trickery I know but I can't fill the top row gaps when the screen shrinks. Do you have any idea if this is possible at all? If so, I would try making element four and five into first and last, so they would shrink/grow independently (so I can set corners). 

Todos:
4) (will do next) data-inset not working yet
5) (will do next) set up with/without data-content-theme
6) (what do you think?) **data-icons-only=""true""** on small screens if icons are specified on all collapsibles 
7) (what do you think?) **data-bottom-bar=""true""** to add a footer to the content section (sample coming up)
8) (what do you think?) **data-tabs=""left|right|bottom|top""** just an idea, but I saw a nice native app using sidebars along header/footer. I would give it a try and see if this is settable with a class and CSS, so the tabs would be the sidebar.

Thanks for reporting the issue. I noticed the same problem in other situations. My conclusion is that this is caused by a change in the way Chrome rounds off when calculating the size of an element where `em` values are used for padding or margin.

On your screenshot the height of div ui-btn-inner is 83px but when you look at ""metrics"" you'll see a value of 82.36666870117188 which becomes 83px. If you change the top/bottom padding of the nested div ui-link-inherit from .7em to 12px (0.7 \* 16px = 11.2 --> 12px) the height is exactly 84px and the problem is gone.

So Chrome only rounds off the total height. Still it would make more sense to me if the unrounded total height would have been 82.4. Maybe the change is not intentional but a bug.

The issue is also visible where we use negative margin, like with ui-listview: http://jsbin.com/atahip/29. The border of the last field container isn't visible.

The first issue has to do with how the browser handles fixed positioned elements and there is not much we can do about that.

Regarding the second problem, it's not completely clear what you mean by ""stop at the header icon"". Do you mean there is space between the fixed header and the top of the page? Or does the header height and/or width change as well?

This still isn't working....in Firefox the URL displayed in the address bar is still displaying decoded and missing the hash (#)...so when you refresh on the URL, the page doesn't reload. 

There were still a handful of places that were using the location.hash.

I see there is a a second ""new"" way to work around this issue that was implemented, but I don't think its fully solving this problem and I don't quite understand why.

Going back to an earlier post....I got this working myself in the 1.1.1 release by simply just changing **everywhere** that `location.hash` was being **read** with `$.mobile.path.parseUrl( location.href ).hash`

I also went through the stable 1.1.1 release and changed every  `location.hash`, `$.mobile.path.parseLocation().hash` and `path.parseLocation().hash` with `$.mobile.path.parseUrl( location.href ).hash` and its working for me.

The second exception appears to be a bug, though we've discussed what to do in the case where something has already been initialized. 

@uGoMobi 

We should look at the widget factory to see if there's a way to tell if the widget has been initialized and then just bail if it has. With `_super` we could just put it in the mobile widget factor (ugh inheritance).

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.widget.js

I agree that it should be possible to have a left to right slide transition. That was the reason I opened this issue.
Because the reverse transition is used for closing the popup, supporting the option `data-direction=""reverse""` is probably not the right solution. I suggest we add a ""slideout"" transition.

You raise and interesting question here: given that we are trying to normalize touch and mouse events, should we also supply a spurious `which` value?

The existing [spec](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-touch-events-20110505/) doesn't make any mention of the attribute and this isn't surprising because it's actually a legacy attribute from the keyboard events according the the DOM lvl 3 events spec.

Hi, the fix does not work for me because I need to skip the filtering after I injected new data items in the list (I used to change the 'lastval' variable from outside the class but I realize that was an ugly hack so I changed your code a little bit and now it work find and it's clean (I hope) :



Let me explain the modifications: 
first I do need to know what is the value of the input text so I added two parameters to the event you created
(if I don't have this value I can't fill the list with my custom item values)
then when I fill the list with new items (all items are removed then new ones are added) : it means that they don't need to be filtered after.

in my event catch function I call event.preventDefault(); which means skip filtering;



note about filtering : 
why do I added code to chane  val and lastval variables?:
if I don't set val and lastval to """" then a search with accends won't work (exemple : enter ""côte"" the 'ô' would be filtered but I want it to be considered as a regular 'o')

I hope you understand my issues because it's not very easy for me to explain. ;)

This sounds more like something for the forum, because it's not about a bug in the framework but how you can accomplish something. Besides that, a sample page would be useful so we can see if you use a multi-page template or not, etc..

I know that its use may not be the standard, but I prefer a controlgroup instead of multiple buttons in the header, to make it more compact, especially if I have left buttons, right buttons and title.

Maybe there should be a common solution to position elements to right or left in the header, such as a data-something instead of a button related class, or maybe renaming the class. I'm not sure of it...

Setting the theme will apply a color scheme (i.e. colors that work together, including background color, widget color(s) and text color), so that's why I was saying I think color scheme can be ok. In the case of overlay theme for popup or dialog, then we are talking about just the one color, so maybe scheme is not appropriate. This is a very specific point, and this is why I would like @toddparker 's opinion. Also, throughout the docs we have used swatch, swatch or theme, but never ""color theme"". So that's why I am not in favor of ""color theme"". It will be applied to these docs and also the api docs and I want to make sure we make the right decision here, so that it doesn't get changed more than once. So hopefully we can resolve this today.

This fix seems to have broken the layout of a navbar and a list combined on android 2.3.x when list text is too long to display.  issue [#4958](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4958)  
For some reason it is interferring with the overflow property of the list on the same page.
I can confirm that the following settings for `.navbar ul'` alleviate the issue of issue #4958 so perhaps substituting one of these will also fix this issue without breaking backward compatibility or we may need to revert back to @johnbender's original javascript solution.  Unfortunately I haven't been able to test on a 4.0.1 device or similar. 



I have also seen @uGoMobi's clearfix suggestion of #5008 which fixes #4958 so perhaps we just need to implement that instead.

You'd need an image on the server for the header which via PhoneGap works for all orientations and devices (in theory) so there's no size?! it does have a max size in the CSS, but it's 100% basically otherwise I think.

It's just really hard to squeeze all my non disclosed plugins, css etc. into your ""test page"".
I've taken a quick try and nothing is working with 1.7.2 on that test page. [All I see is a spinning icon and the footer up top.]

Well I'll burn an hour or two trying further but I doubt I can help you reproduce this (obvious to me and seems like a major) bug?!
I'd assumed someone in the forum would be well familiar with this problem, and a couple of weeks would result in something more...
Again my first impression is Headers and Footers should only exists once and be static and the content changes. It's seems like an after though, wasteful as it's duplicated and redundantly hacked for headers & footers to work.
It appears as if they actually disappear after not animating to reveal a duplicate header underneath.
So it seems static headers and footers is totally being done wrong. If it's static there should be only one entry needed.
I think that's at the root of it's dysfunction. Cause it clearly doesn't update the content section's top after the image in the duplicate banner loads/resizes (stomping over the content area).

Sorry, I was only thinking about the listview options and didn't think about the feature that was added to set `data-ajax=""false""` on a container in general. My bad.

I agree that the fact that this requires `$.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled=true` should be mentioned in the ""Linking without Ajax"" section on this page:
http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-links.html

I was also looking at the section ""Enhancement"" in the data-attribute reference. Shouldn't that second paragraph be: ""Any link or form element inside `data-ajax=""false""` containers..."" ?

There is one more page with information about this topic. I just add the link here so we can check if all information together is clear and consistent. See `$.fn.jqmHijackable()` here:
http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/methods.html

@MauriceG - Do you mind looking into the docs?

4647,2012-07-11 13:02:40,"Hi @Reyncor 

`$.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled` does not disable Ajax.
It just switches on the consideration of `data-ajax=""false""` (and `data-enhance`) for parent containers.

Setting `$.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled` on init to `true`:`
<ul data-role=""listview"" data-ajax=""false"">
<li><a href=""page1.html"">Page 1</a></li>
<li><a href=""page2.html"">Page 2</a></li>
</ul>`
None of the links above will use Ajax.

`$.mobile.ajaxEnabled=""false""` will disable Ajax at all in your application.

If you don't want Ajax at all, you should prefer `$.mobile.ajaxEnabled=""false""`, because `$.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled=""true""` will force the framework to lookup for a Ajax-disabled-parent-containers for each link in your page, and also for parent containers with a `data-enhance=""false""` attribute set, which certainly will impress performance.

I will add ""button"" to the selector that now only contains the anchor element. Maybe the docs need to be adjusted a bit as well, because this functionality is not supposed to work for form buttons.

The input field of the slider is enhanced by the textinput widget. The cause of the issue is the same as for #4637. The call to disable() is missing in the textinput widget. That function adds the ""ui-disabled"" class. The class ""ui-state-disabled"" is added by the jQuery UI widget factory that we use. So it's not just a typo that we need to fix.

Thanks for reporting the issue.

The cause of this is that the bottom border is only added to the last item of the list by using the :last-child pseudo class selector. That doesn't distinguish hidden and visible elements. So you only see the bottom border in that example when ""Volvo"" is in view, because that is the last item in the original list.

Older browsers like IE7 and IE8 don't support the :last-child selector, so on those you will never see a border at the bottom of the list.

I have been thinking about the footer as well. That certainly qualifies as ""subtle"". Downside is that you might find out you have been reading the wrong information only after you reached the bottom of the page.

Something I have been thinking about is adding (small) breadcrumbs at the top of the content div and add the version to the first crumb. For example:

Docs 1.1.1. > Pages > Dialogs

That might also improve the search results on Google. That's another issue mentioned at #3330. Probably best would be if the title contains the version, but I think that would mean we have to hardcode it :(

",gabrielschulhof,uGoMobi
4595,2012-07-05 10:31:03,"The fundamental issue is that, given the navigational sequence below,



... where `*[]*` indicates the page currently being viewed and where ""page loaded without hash change"" means ""page loaded with `$.mobile.changePage( url, { changeHash: false } )`""

when the dialog issues `window.history.back()` upon close, the hash given to `_handleHashChange` will be that of the last page loaded normally (i.e., with hash change - enclosed in `[ # # ]` in the diagram above). This will cause that page to be displayed.

This is incorrect. The page that should be displayed is, of course, the last page that was loaded without hash change (enclosed in `[ |  | ]` in the diagram above).

To achieve this, we need to
1. Record the value of changeHash in each urlHistory entry

and 

2 a. Create a navigation policy such that changeHash: false entries are to some extent ""children"" of the last known changeHash: true entry, and it is the last child that will be switched to upon `window.history.back()`

xor

2 b. Modify the dialog's and the popup's close method to behave similarly to the `$.mobile.hashListeningEnabled = false` case in that they do not call `window.history.back()`, but instead they call some new function within the navigation that performs the jqm equivalent of `window.history.back()` without an actual hashchange.

I'm leaning towards 2 b.

May you can take another look ...

May I missed something, but you can:
- set icon per listview
- disable icon per listview
- leave listview as is and default icon arrow-r will be used
- overwrite icon per item if listview icon is set or disabled
- all works programmatically or by setting `data-icon` on listviiew

The grid component has indeed a maximum of 5 columns. Using more colomns isn't generally recommended on a mobile website. In case you still want more colomns you would have to add custom CSS.

4567,2012-06-20 15:59:57,"@PhilipK-ca 

Since you were talking about the grid component I thought you meant the grid blocks. I now see that the post on SO is about the navbar.

The grid component is based on CSS only. The structure CSS contain rules for ui-grid and ui-block classes which you can add to your markup.
The navbar widget uses the same CSS rules. It calls a helper function ($.fn.grid) that adds the ui-block classes to the navbar buttons. In case of more than 5 buttons it puts two buttons on a row.

The grid CSS is limited to 5 columns. There have to be some kind of limit because every number of columns requires specific CSS rules. That limit has been set to 5 because more columns isn't generally recommended for mobile websites. BTW - I don't see the specific percentage ui-block widths for 6 or 7 column grids in that SO post.

So, if you are talking about grid blocks, it is just a matter of adding custom CSS. If it's about the navbar you indeed have to modify $.fn.grid in the JS as well.

I am sorry I closed your issue right away after you were recommended to open it by the JQM Twitter channel.

I am using jQuery 1.7.1 with JQM 1.1.0 Final. On my index page, i use PHP to generate a list of links where each link is supposed to dynamically inject a page.

Now, when i click on any of the links using my dekstop running Windows 7 on Firefox, it generates the page perfectly and i can move back and forth.

Would it make sense to add a **role=""popup""** inside the data-options object when the popup transitions fire? Similar to dialogs, where I can say: 

  if (  data.options.role == ""dialog""  ) { do nothing }

The bottom corners of the collapsible look good. It is just that the listview inside it sticks out of the collapsible content div.
Non-inset list have negative margin of 15px. See the style note about this here http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/docs-lists.html

You can add data-inset=""true"" to the listview: http://jsfiddle.net/qDwtN/3/

Or - to make it exactly fit - you can add custom CSS where you set the negative margin of ui-listview equal to the padding on the collapsible content. To give the last list item same rounded corners as the collapsible content you can add ui-corner-bottom class: http://jsfiddle.net/qDwtN/2/

4507,2012-06-09 18:55:55,"I guess this would need some work. The dialog styles probably don't apply correctly when it's inside a popup, and as it stands, the div stored in the variable named `dialog` you attach to the DOM at `$(document.body).append(dialog);` has display set to none, so the popup will calculate its size as 0✕0. However, even if you add `dialog.css(""display"", ""block"")` it still doesn't work correctly, because the popup still calculates its size as 0✕0.

Basically, we need to figure out whether we want to support turning dialogs into popups. However, if all you want is a popup that looks like a dialog, then there are several examples in the docs. If you generate the DOM structure at runtime, I suggest you make it look like one of the examples before calling popup on it. That should work.

We normally need to manipulate the baseHref to deal with pages from different directories being pulled into a starting page. In your case, are all pages in a flat list and that's why you don't need this feature?

Sadly the first one is the only one we can't put in the framework CSS. Like Todd said, people can set the radius to anything they like and this would override their setting. If you want fully rounded buttons you can add it as a workaround to your custom CSS.

@toddparker - If you agree, I like to leave this is issue open with low priority label. Maybe I think of another solution that we can include in the framework CSS.

This change seems convenient for the use case described, but are we sure that this is the expected behavior for everyone who adds an active class to the original state of a button on a page? Also, if this is the default behavior for adding ui-btn-active now, how can people opt-out of this to get the original behavior (in which the class is only used for init)?

Are there other issues at play here aside from the inconvenience of adding that persist class, and that it apparently should be documented more broadly than for persistent toolbars alone?  

+@toddparker
",scottjehl,toddparker
4411,2012-05-21 16:19:30,"Ok, just re-read through this whole thread and although I agree that having the active state be persistent after reload would be convenient, we need to be very careful about introducing changes that could affect all the code out there in the world. Because we're following semantic versioning, anytime we change the default behavior, appearance or API of a widget it could be a problem.

If we changed the default to be persistent, then we'd need to add another class to set these back to the old behavior anyway so we'd be adding complexity and unexpected changes for the sake of convenience (even though I agree this would have been a good default). 

In this case, since we already have a mechanism to make the active state persistent, I think we should handle this by improving the documentation to make it clear this applies to all navbars, not just those in fixed or persistent footers. That will be a big help.

@uGoMobi - mind closing and making changes to the docs. I think adding detailed info and even demos to illustrate this is a fantastic idea. We should check the data-attr reference too.

I think if we all agree the more consistent listview behavior is preferred, we could make the change as the default for 1.2 but add a section on the list docs showing the CSS rule to tweak the heights to get back to the 1.1 style. Not sure we need a new attribute, this could just be a style override. Or, if we do anything it would be to allow mini on read-only but that may be a lot of work. That would be a solid change package.

The biggest offender with 5 seconds seems to be related to a blur() call results in a pattern of calls involving fn.init and fn.removeClass ... I didn't count the number of times the pattern repeated but I would hazzard to guess that it's doing it for each item in the listview.

",toddparker,scottjehl
4340,2012-06-21 23:32:35,"Alight @scottjehl figured out the root of the issue here. In 1.0, we first scrolled to the top of the page before starting a transition. In 1.1, we wanted to avoid this jump so we now fade the page out first by default. As it turns out, devices like an iPhone seem to keep the page above your scroll position in memory when doing a transition, but not the part of the page below.

So if you're on a long, complex page like the listview performance page with 500 items, clicking the first list item will work pretty well, but one halfway down will be very slow and a bottom one will crash the browser. Why? Because the browser is trying to animate a really massively tall page when scrolled down due to how it handle things. Test here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-performance.html

As a test, we added another condition to say that if you're either coming or going to a page where the scroll position is 3x the height of the device's screen, skip the transition. This makes the navigation back to it's snappy self. You'll notice we're using scroll position, not screen height here because I can navigate to a 10,000 pixel tall page fine but if I need to navigate away from that same page when scrolled down (or nav back to this with a scroll position restored), it will need way more memory to run the transition and could be slow or fail.

This 3x value is just a starting point, we can use whatever criteria we want. Here is the change to line 28 in jquery.mobile.transition.js to give this a spin:

`none = !$.support.cssTransitions || maxTransitionOverride || !name || name === ""none"" || Math.max( $( window ).scrollTop(), toScroll ) > screenHeight * 3,`

The question is how to layer this in. Do we just pick a value for this for 1.1.1 as a safely valve for performance now, then expose a config option for 1.2 to set the criteria? This is parallel to `maxTransitionOverride` - this sets the screen width that shuts off transitions automatically, this new one is like ```maxTransitionScrollOverride''' where we nix transitions based on vertical scroll position. Naming could be cleaned up to make this clearer.

@gseguin or @johnbender - do you want to give this a look and think about how we should get this in?

It turns out that doing a stack has almost exactly the same code as doing mutually exclusive popups. The only additional thing one needs to do is to ensure that whichever popup is the last one to have been opened ends up on top of all the other already-open popups.

This means that we need to keep track of the z-index values of each screen that is open, and each popup container. This is pretty simple, since we're already storing the already-open popups in a list. We just keep the max value of each of the two (screen and container) z-index values around, and give each new popup the max plus one.

What I was telling @johnbender was that this popup manager can be extended to handle things other than popups as well - i.e., all in-page-navigation can be handled via one of these managers.

4317,2012-05-13 18:54:50,"Hi @rskokan !
Because you do not set any theme on any container (page or content), the default theme is **c**.
The Buttons inherit that c-theme so they are white on startup.
When changing the theme to **a**, the buttons have to be **black**. 
The workaround raises an error: _cannot call methods on button prior to initialization_ and the hover ""animation"" is lost.
This may because you call refresh on the surrounding div, not the button input itself.

Tested with 4S iOS 5.1:  Going the way described above, it looks ok.

But doing the same with page 3 (flip transition), the footer stays like at the screenshot above until the screen is tapped.
Also going to page 3, tapping the iPhone toolbar (address bar comes in and move the page downwards) then using the fade to page 1 button, page 1 is shown correct for a short moment, but when transition is complete, the footer jumps to the position you can see at the screenshot above.

4223,2012-06-14 09:47:46,"At first I thought the idea behind the option to set this to false, was to make it possible to set padding yourself and don't have it overridden by the framework. For instance when you want content on the exact same height no matter the height of the header. Scott's explanation about it being an ""update"" and not a ""set"" function makes sense though.

The padding is already set in the css (see also related issue #4412). Changing it to a ""setPagePadding"" function requires an explanation in the docs that you have to override those rules with custom css if you set it to false.
If anyone wants this to be changed we need a PR that cover all those aspects.

A list inherits its theme swatch from its parent container.
So the theme swatch defaults to &quot;c&quot; (silver in the default theme),

1) @MauriceG in your jsFiddle it says that, absent a theme, swatch c is the default for the page.  Can you point me to where that behavior is documented?  That seems really important, but it was news to me.  I had assumed that the default would be ""a"" everywhere.  There's probably a great doc page that I'm missing.

2) @uGoMobi yes, what you're saying does correct my understanding of how things work. I guess I had assumed that if the footer is black (per theme a) and the only thing in the footer was a navbar (which I'd assume is super common, since it looks the most like the default iphone navbar) then the navbar would be black as well.  But, I'll create another swatch with black buttons to handle this scenario.

4129,2012-04-20 17:26:49,"@iandrewfuchs: the code you pointed to is the code I've been hacking away at.  And, line 114 is the scroll I already have control over.  That line 114 is actually part of the doneIn phase of the transition which I have good control over at this point.  However, there is another scroll that happens somewhere between the click on a back button and the first phase of the transition when going back to a page that had resulted in a lastscroll being tracked for that page.  It seems like a bug.  

For example, if I have one listview that is really long, so if I scroll down pretty far and cause the lastscroll to be set to something like 4000 for that active page, then I select an item, on the next page, if I click the Back button, which should kick off the scroll to top (if I'm scrolled down at all) before the startOut phase of the transition, but it doesn't...it actually scrolls to the scrollTo that was set for the previous page (now the $to page since I'm going back - in this case 4000).  That causes a jump 4000 pixels down, then it scrolls up as part of the startOut phase of the transition.  If I could just figure out where that bug exists in the code, I would be close to having a nice handle on each phase of the transition.    

By the way, another oddity was being caused by the toggleViewportClass() function call.  It seemed to be causing scrollTop to ONLY return between 0 and 80 on Firefox or 0 and 78 if on Chrome.  I just commented out the two or three calls to that function for now.  Did you notice that too?

4129,2012-04-21 03:17:51,"By the way... @landrewfuchs, have you tried applying Scott Jehl's opacity magic that addresses this issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4024

",dcarrith,iandrewfuchs
4129,2012-04-22 06:17:30,"@iandrewfuchs did you just happen to have scrollto.com in your domain stash?  Funny.

I looked at your test page and unfortunately, I'm still seeing the abrupt scrolltop before the transitions.  I understand your perspective that the long scrolls are not user friendly, but to a degree, I think it comes down to user preference.  Personally, I prefer the smooth controlled scrolls over the abrupt and jumpy scrolls.  However, I do agree that if we can make it so the user does not ever see the scrollTop (whether it's scrolling to the top, or it's scrolling back down to last scroll position when returning to a page) then that would be preferred over the animated scrolls.    

The way I see it, if we can control the scroll and each phase of the transition, then we can pretty much do what we want with it.  The way it is currently in v1.1, it seems to sometimes jump to scroll positions before it should (for example, the FROM page scrolls/jumps to the lastscroll of the TO page when going back - because of the call to window.history.back()) or it jumps to scroll positions that don't make any sense (for example, the call to toggleViewportClass() causes a scroll to 80 if in Chrome or 78 if in Firefox).  I still haven't looked into that...I just commented it out.  

It would be nice to be able to slow everything down so that we can observe what is happening when.  The work I did with adding the animated scrolls is a good start I think.  But, a step-through debugger would be nice too.  Let's see what we can do.

Hi Todd!
I'm a little confused about to add ui-bar to headers and/or footers.
The docs at **_1.2.0 pre**_ say
at http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/docs-headers.html:
_Note that **.ui-bar should not be added** to header or footer bars that span the full width of the page, as the additional padding will cause a full-width element to break out of its parent container._ ...

http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/docs-footers.html says:
_By default, toolbars don't have any padding to accommodate nav bars and other widgets. To include padding on the bar, **add a class=""ui-bar""** to the footer._

Thinking more about a **loadFirstPage** event.... this would also be very useful for deeplinks to artifical hashtags. Say I have a page _some.html_, in which I'm updating content via Ajax. 

I would like to reflect the updated page by changing the hashtag, but I can't because all deeplinks to this page ala **some.html#new_content** will break, because the page isn't there and I'm missing an event to tap into the first page being loaded to redirect to the actual page and fire an Ajax call to update the content.

8.2 comment the following line in  jquery.mobile-1.3.2.js
// $.mobile.window.bind( ""throttledresize"", $.mobile.resetActivePageHeight );

Finally this is it, and sorry for this a lot of code and my bad English ): I hop you guys can get any benefit from it .

I've set up a test page: [edit: removed this link; link to new test page will be added to PR]

I am still thinking about a good fallback for IE7. Question: can you take a look at the test page on a Windows Phone device? I can't test WP myself and it would be good to know if IE7 is the only problem I have to deal with.

@Wilto Since you are working on a fix for #3301 (field 60% width) I guess you have been looking into box-sizing border-box as well. Are there other issues besides IE7 that I haven't thought of?

Thanks!

4098,2012-05-31 21:11:38,"@uGoMobi - We tested box-sizing border-box on WP 7 and 7.5 using this link: jsbin.com/emaziy/ 

WP7 Result -----
The border-box form elements display ~10px wider than the current examples so the right stroke is exactly at the right edge of the screen. Nothing wraps oddly or looks off so this seems like an acceptable experience.

WP7.7 Result ------
The border-box form elements display ~5px _narrower_ than the current examples, but this also seems to be your intention because this is how that example renders on iOS5 and Android 4.0. With this narrower input, the space on the left and right is now 100% symmetrical so that change looks great to me.

In general, I think the slightly wider WP7 inputs aren't worth worrying about because most/all WP phones will be upgraded to 7.5 - Microsoft is being aggressive about upgrading. I think this looks great.

For reference, support for box-sizing:
Opera 8.5+: box-sizing
Firefox 1-3: -moz-box-sizing (unprefixed in modern versions)

I have more or less tracked this down to the **pushStateHandler** and the **onPopState** function. 

Disable the function call and you have no more trailing _hashchange_ events. 

I figure as _hashchange_ fires with URL changes and popState changes the URL after the actual changepage and transition, this could be a reason for an additional hashchange firing when popstate is modifying the URL. I guess it's a timing issue, because sometimes it triggers (popstate too late), sometimes it doesn't (popstate in time). The JQM 1.0. version used a setTimeout here. 

Trying to narrow it down.
",frequent,gseguin
4094,2012-04-26 21:09:36,"@gseguin 

Ok. I think I have it:

**Problem 1** = _fromHash_ and _toHash_ are always empty strings
This may be my faulty setup, but in the _hashValueAfterReset_ function this line



always returns empty strings for me. In case the urlHistory has an entry with url like #somePage, I'd expect it to return #somePage and not """". Not sure how to fix this.

**Problem 2** = the order inside if (popState) {... } seems wrong. 
In the current way it's set up, browser hashchanges can always pass, because:



To fix this, I re-shuffled like this (and manually set _hashChanged_ to true): 



it works for me. I only get a single call to **_handleHashChange** and thus a single changePage only. 

I'm not sure whether the browser or popstate induced hashChange should handle the transition. The way I set it up, it will be the popstate that triggers the hashchange. If that's it, I'd be happy to (try my hands on a ) pull request.

4024,2012-04-19 13:08:03,"Just as a test, I did what @orenagiv suggested and turned off my fixed header and footer and put the CSS in place.  While testing in my Phonegap app as well as just in the browser, It became clear to me that the fixed toolbars are definitely contributing to the blinky transitions.  So, it's not just causing a white/flash flicker in Phonegap as is covered by this issue.  I love the progress that was made to get the fixed toolbars to the state they are in now.  Unfortunately though, it seems that there are some side effects caused by the magic that was used.  Another test I ran, and actually ended up leaving in place, was to set all of my transitionFallbacks to none.  That way, if running on a platform that doesn't have good support for the 3d transforms, it just turns off the transitions.  The result is far better than the default fade.          
",dcarrith,orenagiv
4024,2012-04-20 18:58:45,"For me, that CSS tweak suggested by @orenagiv didn't make any difference. With the regular fixed toolbars, the main issue I saw was the toolbar on the TO page flickering in and out during the transition. However, applying the suggested CSS to static toolbars instead made for a much more flickery overall transition for me - where pages were blinking twice rather than an odd toolbar.

After a lot of tinkering tonight, the following commit seems to do some good, at least in Fade transitions on my iOS5 device:
https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/ff1a7e019f45ad00fc9aa3e0fcb08df5acc54a66

Alternatively, people could choose to just hide the toolbars during transitions, which would help too, if also changing the effect a bit. The css for that would be something like this:
.ui-mobile-viewport-transitioning .ui-header-fixed,
.ui-mobile-viewport-transitioning .ui-footer-fixed { visibility: hidden; }

4003,2012-04-11 11:18:10,"not sure if this is an issue.

I'm trying to find my way around with the new fixed-toolbars as per the docs.

Reproduce:
- Go to the docs page  http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0-rc.2/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html
- Firebug-shrink the page-height to below screen-height e.g. by setting  **page min-height: ...px** to **height: ...px** 
- The fixed footer will no longer slide-out and hide. 
- Instead it will jump up to mid screen.

I guess it's kind of an odd case having a page with page-height < screen-height AND using fixed toolbars, but I guess it might happen nevertheless (I'm thinking templates for headers and footers used across an app).

@johnbender 
I filed a similar issue with the old fixed toolbar - #3050 pull request, issue #2646. Back then the issue was setting CSS top: 0 when hiding the footer. This moves the footer to the end of the page. When the page is longer than the screen, the footer is hidden out of view. However, if the page ends mid screen, the footer will jump up to the middle of the screen.

Maybe this helps. If it's an issue after all.

Depending on what you are using server side you might need to pull in some part of your environment's standard library to parse the whole uri and get you the hash fragment if it's not provided by the request handling part of the stack.

Better to move this fix from toolbar to orientation widget:

- Open from home screen,

I update your test page so it loads latest code: http://jsfiddle.net/ZsKgD/
While testing several browsers I didn't see anything odd. The slider does not disappear. Maybe you can test it again on your devices.

Regarding internal (multi-page template), external (single page) and the pageinit event; it all depends whether the page has been removed from the DOM.
This won't happen with a internal page because it is in one file together with other pages, but does happen with external pages after you leave them (exceptions are the first-loaded page and data-dom-cache set to true).
So the next time you go to that page it will be created again which means pageinit will fire again.

3869,2012-03-23 07:36:30,"This issue has been opened and closed a few times in the past month or so, and I frustratingly can't find any of them!

But I did find the simple demo I made to reproduce the issue without jQM at all. The buttons in the footer can be clicked once to scroll the page, then they'll be unclickable. The focus/target area of the buttons actually leave the button boundaries!

http://jsbin.com/iredok

The only way to restore it that I could find is to interact with the page - toggling page display didn't seem to help, and neither does toggling style to trigger a reflow, like tweaking the padding on the page to something large, then removing it again.

The problem is not just in Android - it's iOS5 too! It's only an issue with programmatically scrolling the page - user scrolling doesn't cause any problems that I can see. It only seems to affect real form controls, like input, button, select, etc - anchor buttons seem to be fine.

One last oddity: double-tapping the buttons works in iOS5. I'm not sure why. 

Given that this is not our bug, I think the best we can do is document it so people know not to do it: ""If you're using form controls inside fixed headers, do not programmatically scroll the window."" 

We should also avoid in-page scrolling in our own components: for example, we were considering scrolling the page programatically when collapsibles are expanded, but that'll potentially introduce this bug.

3863,2012-03-20 19:21:20,"My current jQM project has two ""notext"" link buttons side-by-side in a fixed header bar. This wasn't a problem in 1.0.1, but the true fixed positioning in 1.1 has lead to a problem in the Android 2.2 browser. The first of the two buttons is usable, but the second one gets its active state triggered without actually causing navigation to the new page.
- Bug demo: http://jsbin.com/eyufam/148
- Same, without fixed-position header: http://jsbin.com/eyufam/149
- Corrected using new CSS: http://jsbin.com/eyufam/147

My fix works by eliminating all relative or absolute positioning in the buttons and hiding the button text with a modified version of the ""font crunch"" approach [used in the HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/commit/aa0396eae757c9e03dda4e463fb0d4db5a5f82d7) and discussed in jQM issue #3851.

So far I've tested the fix in these browsers:
- FF 11
- Mobile FF 10.0.3
- current Chrome for Android beta
- Opera Mobile 12
- Opera Mini 6.5.27452
- Android Browser 2.2
- Android Browser 2.3.3
- HTC's version of Android Browser 2.3.5
- Android Browser 4.0

It seems likely this issue is a subset of the larger problems with absolute positioning in Android 2.2 and 2.3 discovered in @Wilto's research into issue #3712. Might the approach taken in my fix for this issue help with other, related absolute positioning problems?

3792,2012-03-11 14:48:30,"I just upgraded our test Playbook running 2.0 and noticed that both checkboxes and radiobuttons are broken on this platform.

Go here:
http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/checkboxes/
http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/radiobuttons/

On PB2, the checkbox and radio icon is missing so these just look like buttons. Tapping either will show the down state but since there's no icon, you don't get visual feedback. Interestingly, the horizontal check/radios look and work ok. This is probably because these don't show the icon on the left and flip to ui-state-active when tapped so these are pretty different.

First, thanks for the fiddle. It's rare and always appreciated.

In general we support this type of activity through refresh methods triggered through the plugin system:



The update layout is meant, I think, mostly for you to bind to to know when you should update custom widgets or components in the page. Not as a mechanism for telling our components to update. Though I can sympathize with the confusion.

To support this we'd have to add a refresh or collapse method to the widget and that's not likely to happen before 1.1 final.

Sorry, I need to repost this. I think I have narrowed #3645 down to what's wrong.

I used your fiddle from #3645. This is the new fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/hDGVZ/3/

The problem is, you cannot trigger an event on the first page being loaded using on(). Doesn't work with pageID or div.jqmData(role=""page"").

If I do this using live() instead, I can set a listener for the the first page on both #pageID or div:jqmData(role=""page""). Both fire as expected when the page loads. Using on() on the first page however does nothing.

I can confirm that by undoing that change, and adding width: 100%; back in for the .ui-header, .ui-footer rule fixes this issue, so I'm guessing we just need to add it back, but perhaps scoped to fixed toolbars this time, since it's only needed there.

@wilto - was there a bug related to that commit, or a particular conflict within our own code that made it necessary? If it was only related to external customizations where a developer needed to add left or right padding of their own, I'm wondering if that's the sort of thing where we should say, ""if you need to add padding to the toolbar itself, adjust its width accordingly""…?

After this, I'll push a commit to fix this by bringing the width back for fixed toolbars only, and if any conflicts resurface as a result, we should probably figure out a plan to address them differently.

In testing, this not only fixes this issue, but seems to prevent blinks in Chrome during toolbar toggles (a nice unintentional bonus :) ).

3658,2012-02-29 11:29:48,"@wilto's fix looks like it improved the keyboard nav itself when headers are involved. 

It's using button-down now on focus? That seems unexpected to me… even if it might look better with our default theme. Shouldn't it just use hover/focus classes? Maybe our hover just needs more punch?

That aside, this latest change added ui-focus classes to focused buttons. Before, we were relying only on the :focus pseudo class on buttons themselves, but that doesn't bubble for focused child elements, so it didn't show up in listviews - list view markup is odd (links inside ""buttons"").

Anyway, I think the combined changes bring good coverage for custom selects. 

Fullscreens are still an issue, yeah. I'll reopen

So, if the script for those widgets is loaded asynchronously along with some code for hooking up to things once the page has been enhanced for sure, then we'll have load order issues. That's one of the reasons we need the second (init) event.

In short:

pagecreate - enhance page now
pageinit - the page is loaded and enhanced (meaning the DOM won't change anymore), and ready for your event hookups.

There was a bug in IE9/WP7 that messed up rounded corners with filter-based gradients that Microsoft couldn't fix so we went with dropping the ugly filter and keeping rounded corners.

3558,2012-02-28 14:11:02,"Hi @toddparker, @Wilto,

I have some additional idea how to disable link button in IE. We can render link buttons in ‘buttons’ plugin instead of ‘buttonmarkup’ plugin. In this case we can use disable() and enable() functions for link buttons the same way as for general buttons. All we need is to add [data-role=’button’] to ‘buttons’ plugin initSelector and remove ‘:jqmData(role='button')’ from ‘buttonmarkup’ plugin initSelectior. It works for IE8/9. In this case we will have 'disabled' attribute and also 'ui-disabled' css class. 'disabled'  attribute will make the trick to make link unclickable for IE8/9. Unfortunately I found out that this approach doesn’t work for IE7 because it ignores ‘disabled’ attribute and link stays clickable. As a possible workaround we can temporary rename ‘href’ attribute in disabled() func to ‘hrefTemp’ and set it again in enable() func.

I think this just transplanted the issue that jQuery had up into our code. The problem with swallowing the exception is that it's the same as not calling focus at all in IE. If we remove the focus call altogether then it doesn't much matter but if the focus call is important then we need to move the focus call to the point at which the element is visible.

3496,2012-05-05 19:07:48,"hi @tigbro 

You are right about the cause of the problem and that means it might only require a minor change to make this work.

By adding the classes you mentioned (and ui-controlgroup-last) to the list of classes that have to be removed we can use the current controlgroup function to refresh a controlgroup as well.
Only difference with real widgets would be that you don't have to send the 'refresh' parameter: $(#mycontrolgroup).controlgroup(); This is something we would have to add to the info in the docs.

Here is a fiddle that loads a version of the JS in which I made the change: http://jsbin.com/agayas/11/
Of course it requires some more testing and thinking about edge cases but so far I don't see a problem.

I don't think controlgroup needs to become a 'real' widget because it is always used in combination with another widget (button, checkboxradio or selectmenu). So it is more like an extension of those.
Maybe we can make it work this way that when you refresh those widgets the framework checks if they are wrapped in a controlgroup and, if so, trigger controlgroup() on that element.

I am in favour of a grid widget! It would be great when the grid/block classes are added by the framework like it is done for navbars so you can dynamically inject a new block.

@offsky 
In your fiddle you use document ready. In the docs at the page about events you can read why you shouldn't use that. Also, you call .checkboxradio() after appending new button markup. That function is to refresh the button after you manipulated the state of it. When injecting one you should use .trigger( ""create"");

Setting the padding based on toolbar height is trivial, but I'm a little hesitant of constantly updating it on resize, since this may not affect the average jQM user (only those with taller toolbars). We already do a lot of that sort of thing on resize, and pageshow.

Questions:
- Should this behavior happen automatically, or would a public method that you could call when your app needs it be sufficient?
- If we set it up to update the padding automatically, should that behavior be optional? Do we default to on or off?

Thanks!
",scottjehl,rwldrn
3484,2012-01-25 11:42:48,"Hey folks.

As noted in my commit message, this method is implemented now, but there are some pretty significant caveats to its usage.

Given the limitations, I'm unsure how best to proceed. I think for many cases, a rule like the following in a custom CSS file will provide the smoothest user experience:



Setting a custom value will ensure things look good when the page is initially transitioning-in (something the method is currently unable to do).

Using the method, devs could use the method to update things when their app reflows, such as on resize, but maybe at other times as well:



However, there are other caveats too, like setting a height in pixels, since it'll become incorrect if the font-size changes. Also, we already run a lot of scripting during page transitions.

This leads back to how it could be handled without JS.

The custom CSS value may not be infallible by itself, since a header with several child elements could be taller at certain viewport sizes than it is at others. Again, this can be addressed with custom CSS:



So, I think custom CSS is the best way to handle this one, as it's less intensive JS-wise, and will likely make for a smoother experience. Let me know what you think. Thanks!

I'm using jQuery Mobile 1.0 (as well as the nightly build - both don't work), and jQuery 1.6.4 in the above examples.  Adding @href=""#"" to the form tag or removing @data-ajax=""false"" fixes the problem.  ""Fails to load"" means that the ajax-loading.png is placed over the first page, although it is not animated and nothing happens.

The relevant error that comes up in the console upon clicking the button is:
jquery.mobile-1.0.js:2824TypeError: 'undefined' is not an object (evaluating 'thisUrl.replace')

Hope this helped.  Let me know if you still have trouble reproducing it.

When the pageinit event fires, that just signals that the framework is done enhancing the page. It does _NOT_ mean that the browser has responded to the changes we just made to the DOM/CSS. Changes to the DOM/CSS usually generate layout requests, but most browsers batch them for performance reasons, and don't actually re-layout the document until the call-stack unwinds and the app returns to the main-event loop. This is why setTimeout() magically fixes things for folks. When the timeout fires, the browser has had time to re-layout the document so that the height of the document is accurate, and most importantly larger than the viewport size, which is a requirement for the navbar to be scrolled off screen.

That all said, there are certain properties that you can access, that the browser can't give you an answer for unless it does a synchronous layout. If you access properties like offsetWidth/offsetHeight/scrollWidth/scrollHeight on something like the body element, that is usually enough to cause the browser to go through the layout motions immediately, so use with care.

If I understand you right that pull request @toddparker is refering to is not related. That only concerns regular links in bars.

You are talking about anchor elements that are styled as buttons. In case you add a rule for a:visited this will apply to all buttons because a:visited has a higer level of specificity than .ui-btn-up-c.

To prevent this from happening a rule has to be added for the visited pseudo class for each theme/swatch, for each button state (up/hover/down). In case H5BP CSS has rules for a:hover and a:active two more rules has to be added to each theme for the hover and down state.

Why not just remove it from your H5BP CSS?

3404,2012-01-10 18:57:02,"I noticed this when investigating #3402.  Since [this commit](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b32facdd1dbb0a2635ac0d54182e5a6cd5b96f5a), the ""structure"" styles are being loaded twice in most places in the docs, specifically when the `<link>` href is to the theme folder and not to the jquery.mobile.theme.css file.

For example, if the page header has this:



then css/themes/default/index.php is used, which loads the license file + theme CSS file + structure CSS files.  Since the theme file already `@import`'s the structure files, those styles end up being added before _and_ after the theme styles.

But if the page header has this:



then you just get the `@import`ed structure files + theme styles, which is correct.

Doubling up the structure styles is not an issue unless it screws up the order in relation to other styles, so I think the easiest fix for this is just to reorder the files in /css/structure/index.php so that you get structure styles + `@import`ed structure files + theme styles.

I'll mostly defer to @gseguin on this, but your interest is greatly appreciated given your obvious familiarity with the subject matter!

Our primary goal, before even beginning with AMD, was to create a download builder so that people could slim down the library where possible. We obviously needed to determine dependencies and using AMD to do that resolution was a clear win over doing something custom (note: the deps themselves are still a work in process). The use of it in the docs and tests is just a happy coincidence that lets devs discard php while working on the library. 

The decision to use pragmas came after attempting to using sed in our build process which turned out to be clunky. We also wanted any reference to AMD to be discarded in our builds since we aren't really using it to define modules, just for dependencies. 

All that said, we are considering leveraging AMD in a more traditional manner (which I'm relatively ignorant of) by doing things  like you've mentioned and possible defining module exports.

Hopefully that gives you some insight into our motivation and why our AMD implementation looks rather stunted :D
",johnbender,gseguin
3386,2012-01-05 21:43:21,"@johnbender that makes sense, I know of some libraries that just use AMD-style internally for this kind of thing and do not use it once the file is built. That is a great use for it, and I think what I mentioned above would fit that style and reduce some line noise in the source. But I'll wait for @gseguin to comment on it.

3373,2012-07-16 21:31:24,"Based on @jblas his comments and having discussed this with @johnbender I close this ticket since it is more a jQuery Core than Mobile issue.
",jaspermdegroot,johnbender
3371,2012-01-02 17:57:18,"I found this in jquery.mobile-1.0.css:
/*orientations from js are available */
@media screen and (orientation: portrait){
.ui-mobile, .ui-mobile .ui-page { min-height: 420px; }
}
@media screen and (orientation: landscape){
.ui-mobile, .ui-mobile .ui-page { min-height: 300px; }
}

The css assumes that all devices have at least 420px height in portrait mode which is not true on my HTC Tatoo (it only has 320 px). This causes the displayed page to be scrollable which is not what is intended. I can scroll the page down so that the header dissapears.

To reproduce You can use the following html:
&lt;!doctype html&gt;<br/>&lt;html class=&quot;ui-mobile&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;head&gt;<br/>    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;title&gt;Bla bla&lt;/title&gt;<br/>    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width,initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/css/jquery.mobile-1.0.css&quot;/&gt;<br/>    &lt;script src=&quot;js/jquery/jquery-1.7.1.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>    &lt;script src=&quot;js/jquery/jquery.mobile-1.0.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br/>&lt;/head&gt;<br/>&lt;body style=&quot;background-color: green;&quot;&gt;<br/>&lt;div data-role=&quot;page&quot; style=&quot;background-color: blue;&quot; id=&quot;androidTest&quot;&gt;<br/>    &lt;div data-role=&quot;header&quot;&gt;<br/>        &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;<br/>    &lt;/div&gt;<br/>    &lt;div data-role=&quot;content&quot;&gt;<br/>        &lt;p&gt;Hello world&lt;/p&gt;<br/>    &lt;/div&gt;<br/>&lt;/div&gt;<br/>&lt;/body&gt;<br/>&lt;/html&gt;

Notice that the css is served locally. The bug manifests itself when you put the min-height to a value that is bigger (say by 50 px) than the screen height of your device.
",dilbert-elbonia,media
3371,2012-01-03 01:09:26,"Just adding some context here. 

This min-height is present so that the address bar can be hidden (assuming that's a desirable feature in your app). If the page is shorter than the screen, the address bar won't hide on iOS or Android. If you're interested, here's a really long post on the subject of hiding address bars... http://24ways.org/2011/raising-the-bar-on-mobile

Of course, the values here are pretty arbitrary as there's no common screen size value to use across devices. Since iOS is capable of rendering the best jQM experience currently, these defaults cater to that platform, but they only serve as a default that is later overridden by a calculated JS value, based on screen size or window height, and adjusted at load, orientation change, and resize.

In other words, these values are only used during page load, after which they're replaced with something more appropriate. We're open to ideas on how to remove them, ideally without breaking the address bar hiding feature, which seems to be popular among our audience.

As a sidenote: if the height is just plain wrong on your device, it's likely that our JS needs some help, rather than the CSS. This one is pretty hard to get right across browsers, but see the $.mobile.getScreenHeight function for more on that.

Thanks!

We can disable the event for one of those cases (url or object) or add a new event for one of them (`pageafterloadbeforechangezomgwtfbbq`?). I have to ask @jblas about which makes the most sense (probably the second) but this first will break backwards compat and the second will mean deprecating one of the `pagebeforechange` calls.

Q1

I agree it would be nice to have a `data-*` attribute for the option but putting it on the link itself seems odd in the same way that designating the page loaded should be a dialog is odd. In the case of `data-rel=dialog` the convenience is such a massive win that any weirdness and difficulty in implementation is forgotten. Otherwise we might end up with a bunch of dialog specific data attributes on the link. 

I think we should make it a page/dialog data attribute option. The only people we're pleasing by putting the data attribute on the link is the intersection of the set of people who don't know whether the linked page should be a dialog or a page at design time and the set of people who want to alter the default bottom corner behavior (small set of folks imo).

@toddparker can/should this be off by default?

Q2

The data attributes should be available in the `this.options` object in the dialog widget. If we go the above route that should be a non-issue.

3290,2011-12-21 20:38:44,"Regarding #1, some browsers don't clip the content inside of an element to it's border-radius, so if content inside a rounded element specifies a background, the corners of the content render over the rounded corners of the element. I believe this is why things like the custom-select pop-up (used when items fit completely within the viewport) use padding on the element to make sure the rounded corners show. In this particular case, the .ui-content container that is the parent of the listview specifies a 15px padding all around, but the non-inset listview by default specifies a -15px margin which basically negates the .ui-content's padding. We need to consult @toddparker, @wilto, and/or @scottjehl as to what the proper thing to do here is? Live with it? Add padding? I noticed that a listview inside custom-select dialog actually gets a unique class placed on it ui-selectmenu-list, but didn't see any rules defined for it.

Regarding #2, it would be nice if we could figure out what exactly is causing the slow down, and what contributes to it? Is it the number of items in the list? Is it  a specific style that's in use? What are you using as your test case for this? When you mention scroll lag, are you talking about when your finger is down and you are dragging things around? Or is it after you drag and lift your finger to scroll with momentum? I ask because I'm wondering if the lag is due to a redraw of the hover/down state on the list item you touched to initiate the drag?

Regarding #a, I think this should be done regardless. We don't want to introduce interdependencies between or knowledge of other components if we can help it.

Regarding #b, not sure what you meant by a ""different place"", but if there is another way to apply it that doesn't introduce this lag I'd be willing to hear about it.

Regarding #c, we don't want to do this. The rounded corners are a property of an ancestor of the listview so we don't want the listview dictating to it's ancestor containers/components how they should be styled.

Regarding #d we should do this if there is no solution/workaround. I also see this related to #1 ... if in the custom-select dialog case we see square buttons everywhere except WP7 and FF, then maybe we should disable it for all custom-select dialogs ... this is where the option in #a comes into play. It would be passed to the dialog() constructor in the custom-select code.

So anyway, in createVirtualEvent it looks like that code was copied from UI and I am still not clear on the comment there about ""fixing"" the event multiple times. The jQuery.event.fix method is intended to normalize a browser event into a jQuery.Event object. Once you have a jQuery.Event object there shouldn't be a need to fix it again, since the event has already been normalized to the best of jQuery's ability. You can just copy over all of its properties. I recall talking to @scottgonzalez about using jQuery.extend for this but can't recall if there were specific issues that prevented it.

Most likely this is pointing towards a need for something like the ability for jQuery.Event to accept an existing Event object and copy its properties, because we definitely shouldn't have UI and Mobile doing a copy-pasta on parts of jQuery.event.fix.

1. baseTagTest() as implemented in 1.0 is not returning the correct support value in the case the document contains an existing <base> tag.
2. baseTagTest() as implemented in 1.0 does not test the actually dynamic change of the base tag in the case the document contains an existing <base> tag.
3. getClosestBaseUrl() assumes that the data-url path for a given page is the base when in-fact it may not be.
4. External documents that are loaded as pages can contain a base tag that uses a _DIFFERENT_ path from the application document that loaded it with AJAX.

The baseTagTest() re-write I posted a few comments back addresses both #1 and #2.

@jguyomard attempted to fix #3 by forcing the URL to be used to be the base if $.support.dynamicBaseTag was true, but the fix assumes that all external documents will have the same base, when in fact they won't, especially in the case where no base tag is ever used, but the platform/device actually supports dynamicBaseTag.

#4 is a known issue. We don't support the loading of external pages that specify their own <base> tag, which I hope to fix during the 1.x timeframe. I believe there is an actual issue already reported about it.

I think a better interim fix for #3, until we can add support for #4, is to modify getClosestBaseUrl() to do this check:



That way we can get the case where the application document contains a <base> and the external pages don't, working.

The alternative, would be to assume that all external documents pulled in are assumed to have the exact same <base> path which I think @jguyomard was thinking and instead check:

The version of JQM we're running is after the @Wilto version. We're running the official JQM 1.0 final release.  ""Out of the box"" , JQM 1.0 final was setting aria-hidden=true on all lists.

We changed the JQM 1.0 final code (line 6192 in version 1.0) in our local copy to now read...

buttonInner.setAttribute(""aria-hidden"", ""false"");

and now lists in our local copy of JQM work with ARIA / Voiceover.

I've attached a screen shot of a section of your code changes. I highlighted in gray the field value in question. In our version, we changed ""true"" to ""false"" to prevent ARIA from hiding the buttons / lists.

3216,2012-01-22 16:37:47,"I've encountered a few issues with the new fixed position code.  @barbalex and @AbhinandanPanda have mentioned some of them.

1.) The tap to toggle is also triggered when clicking buttons on pages (or LI items, etc) with fixed headers/footers (I suppose it's just when you click on anything since @barbalex mentioned that it happens when trying to focus on form inputs too).

2.) Sometimes the fixed header will toggle, then it's just gone (i.e. if I scroll back up to the top, it isn't inline at the top as it should be). At that point, the only way to get the header back is to scroll down enough for it to be toggled on a click and then click to toggle.

3.) I know this has been mentioned in the 3217 thread, and I'm not sure if it could have been caused by the fixed position changes, but maybe.  I have two buttons in a data-role=""header"" role=""banner"" div that were showing up fine before I pulled down the latest code to test this fixed position issue.  

The first issue deals with buttons with only text in them (no icons).  The ellipses truncation is cutting text off sooner than it did in the official 1.0 release.  Noticed on a couple devices running some form of Gingerbread then Tested on Chrome, Safari and Firefox running on OSX.  It seems that it's just an issue caused by a change to when that ellipses truncation kicks in.  On the browsers running on OSX, I have to set the width to somewhere between 692 and 696 or so to get a six and seven letter words to show fully.  There should be plenty of space even when rendering on a mobile phone browser.  Two buttons in the same row are allotted 28% each (total 56%) of the width of the page.  

The other issue is with two buttons that are on a fixed position footer.  The two buttons only have an up and down arrow icon in them.  For some reason, the width of the button is rendering much more narrow than it used to.  So, it's not wide enough to show the whole 16px wide up and down arrows.  Those are the only two things on the footer.  With the official 1.0 release, I could have the space allocated for the two buttons at a 10% width of the page.  After pulling down to test the fixed position code, I have to give them about 25% of the width of the page in order for them to render properly.  Certainly 10% should be enough for rendering a little button with a 16-24px button on it.

3207,2011-12-02 13:31:00,"padding/margin gets very big and ugly at small resolutions like 320

Culprit seems to be the following

default value is set as:

`.ui-field-contain { padding: 1.5em 0; margin: 0; border-bottom-width: 1px; overflow: visible; }`

And one line below we have:

`@media all and (min-width: 450px){
    .ui-field-contain { border-width: 0; padding: 0; margin: 1em 0; }

I also suggest clarifying the best usage of the events ""pageBeforeCreate"", ""pageCreate"", ""pageBeforeShow"", and ""pageShow"".   Due to pre-1.0 changes in JQM and bad Internet examples, there's large discrepancy on when and where to use these events.  Though the event names seem self-explanatory, I get confused often and must resort to ""experiments"" to determine which I need.  The asynchronous page-loading model makes these events particularly confusing at times.  (Or maybe it's just me.  LOL)

",jasondscott,toddparker
3154,2011-11-23 19:33:12,"As of jQuery Mobile 1.0, the entire markup within a page is scanned for elements to be enhanced. This is problematic for 3rd party widgets/libraries that don't want anybody enhancing their markup or attaching behavior. We need some data-\* attribute that we can place on an element container that tells the framework not to enhance anything inside it.

There is a potential performance problem here since this means all components that do enhancement must first look up the ancestor hierarchy to see if the element they are about to enhance falls under one of these special containers. @toddparker and I were discussing this and he suggested that perhaps we only pay this cost if a configuration flag is turned on ... that is support for this special attribute would only be available if the user knowingly turned it on and was willing to pay the price. When implementing this feature, keep in mind that we may want to avoid using $.fn.closest() and instead crawl the ancestor hierarchy manually since it is much faster.
",jblas,toddparker
3154,2012-02-17 20:18:25,"@toddparker @jblas 

So I stopped to think about making this alteration to the various `$.fn` plugins. In the same way it doesn't  make sense (to me at least) to just exclude elements from widget enhancement implicitly by adding logic to our `_createWidget` decoration, it doesn't make sense for someone to call `$(""foo"").controlgroup()` and only have some of the elements enhance without an obvious reason why.

Instead I've added `$.fn.jqmEnhanceable` (open to naming suggestions) as a collection pruning method so that wherever these fluent helpers are called it will be obvious where to look for the exclusion logic. 



I'm going under the assumption that I should add these to all the callsites of all the plugins internally because these data-enhance false containers could live inside widget markup that might contain something that requires `buttonMarkup`.
",johnbender,toddparker
3154,2012-02-18 00:44:55,"All that's left, barring a @scottjehl injunction on the whole explicit/implicit business, is the documentation of `data-enhance=false` and `$.fn.jqmEnhanceable`.

http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-search-filtertext.html

You should file a new issue for the filter event request.  Alternatively, you could have a high frequency timer checking whether you have text in the filter input and any listview items that match `$(""#mylist"").children(""li.ui-screen-hidden"")`.  If you don't want to use a timer, you could bind it to the `change` and `keyup` events on the filter input, but then you'd have to make sure the jQM filtering was complete before you ran the check.

On forcing the filter to be reapplied: I haven't tested this, but I'm pretty sure you can just trigger the `change` event on the filter input after you add items, since jQM's filtering function is bound to the `change` and `keyup` events.
",jakeboone02,toddparker
3149,2011-12-12 23:34:40,"@frequent

Each UI component in the framework is self-contained. The way they hook into the enhancement mechanism is by binding to the pagecreate event at the document level. This means that anytime an instance of a page component is _CREATED_, each component handler will get invoked. These handlers usually search for elements (by tag name, by selector) underneath the page element that is the target of the ""pagecreate"" event.

Pages within the framework are created by invoking $.fn.page() on a jquery collection that contains a page element. Because the Page component is implemented as a UI widget, you can really only call $.fn.page() on a given element once. Subsequent calls to $.fn.page() as a constructor are ignored since an underlying page object already exists for that element. This means the ""pagecreate"" event is only fired once _EVER_ for a given page element.

This is why @scottjehl added support for a generic ""create"" event. The intent was that the ""create"" event could be triggered by developers, for a page that was _ALREADY_ created, to wake up the UI components to search for newly added markup, within the target page, they should enhance.

Most components, excluding the page component, listen for ""create"" events.

That all said, if you inject page markup into the DOM and then navigate to it, the new page should be enhanced automatically for you. Is this not the case?

A couple of options here:
- Block the click handler when a change page is in progress. Note we already track this and queue any requests, which is what happens here.
- Throw an overlay over the entire content to catch any clicks.

Option 1 above would require us to catch the click and basically kill it (preventDefault and stopPropagation) because we don't want the 2nd click to actually cause the browser to navigate.

Option 2 may have some rendering implications on slower platforms that think they need to repaint the entire screen because what is transitioning is underneath an element.

From here go to close to the bottom of the page (error does not happen if final move to the bottom of the page is a flick). Scroll to the bottom of the page by placing your finger down on one of the names and drag the screen moving upward until the page is at the bottom. Lift your finger off the screen.

Three quick updates that I made you might be interested in. 
- `$.fn.attr()` -> `$.fn.prop()` 

`disabled` is a boolean attribute and per the 1.6.1 docs `prop` is the prefered method for accessing and updating booleans on elements. Credit to @eddiemonge for pointing this out and helping me to understand that the distinction pertains mostly to boolean properties.

https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/0ffaab8d223733a3695328630e5e9902f570baa1
- I chose to reference the text wrapper element directly instead of exposing the implementation via the class selector. This way the `buttonMarkup` helper can change how it creates and references the element without anyone having to know about the details.

We don't currently support query parameters as part of the hash fragment, though this is something that's been discussed frequently internally and is on the feature request list. 

For clarity you'll note in the [rfc](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.5) that the fragment is ""is indicated by the presence of a number sign (""#"") character and terminated by the end of the URI"". So if you are looking to provide those parameters as part of a request to a server they need to be moved before the fragment.

We decided that if we make changes again it should be a permanent solution, so we don't keep changing things each version. We didn't have enough time to do this for 1.4 so it has to wait until 1.5.

From the 1.4 changelog: ""Deprecated current behaviour of stripping query strings from hashes. Starting in 1.5 we’ll be following spec on hashes and provide a hook to handle custom navigation.""

In the meantime we will look into a workaround that can be used with 1.3 and 1.4. When there is one we will inform you about it in a comment on this ticket.

We scroll down one pixel on load to hide the nav bar. You can disable this behavior if you like by setting `$.mobile.defaultHomeScroll` to 0 in a document ready binding added _after_ the jquery mobile javascript is included in your document.



Keep in mind that this likely won't work for the first page load (let me know if it does) and it will disable the navbar hide. If you give it a try and we can justify the use case I can add a ||= in there to prevent redefinition before the first page is loaded.

I've actually seen this problem before. It's not actually firing multiple events. It's a bug in Chrome where it is echoing _EVERYTHING_ written to the log again any time you write to the log. If you actually attach the log-page-events bookmarklet, it somehow fills up the console buffer with enough text that the bug does not happen.

You can also verify that this is a console bug by simply throwing an alert. You will see that the alert only happens once as expected.

I think this is a documentation issue. From the [docs page](http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/docs-headers.html) you can build your own bar's using the provided `ui-bar` structural css with some alterations. The header styling that requires the `h1` is just a convenient default.

",jhogervorst,uGoMobi
2719,2013-05-23 22:56:47,"@uGoMobi 

Just started working on this issue. Unfortunately there're some difficulties again. Because the height property of textareas has a CSS transition, setting the height to `auto` (as required for the solution you proposed) is displayed with a transition as well. The required height values of the element are only correct after the transition ended.

A solution as described [on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11132043/251760) would be to add a CSS class `.notransition` that is applied before setting the height to auto. However, because the final resizing should be animated, the initial height should be restored afterwards.

The final implementation would be like this:



What do you think about it? Is it worth it? If so, I'll (try to) implement it. And if you have suggestions for the name of the class, that'd be welcome. (I was thinking about `.ui-input-no-transitions`?)

2639,2011-10-07 22:46:07,"Hi Steve
Thanks for the feedback.

I'm looking into this now. It looks like we have outline set to ""none"" in one place that it shouldn't be, so I'll fix that up. I'm assuming it was in there to keep the outlines from creeping into the mouse experience, which is a constant complaint we get as soon as it crops up.

You mentioned the buttons being ""not real links."" Can you expand on that? Maybe the buttons you were looking at are an edge case that I'm forgetting about, but all of the buttons on the site should be either anchor elements or some sort of form button or input button. One exception is we're wrapping the input @type=button elements in a div to achieve styling that was otherwise difficult to achieve, but the input itself should still be actionable. Let me know!

As for landmarks, I suppose we could use some improvement in the markup our docs site, but that won't affect the widgets that we provide to end developers. The one area of the framework code that does seem to match a landmarks use case is the ""page"" divisions, which are optional elements that can be used to create a simple header, content, footer breakdown. When we enhance those components, we apply the ARIA roles ""banner"", ""main"", and ""contentinfo"" to them, respectively, does that seem appropriate? These elements aren't in every section of our docs, but you can find them on a lot of pages like this one: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0rc1/docs/toolbars/docs-bars.html

As for other ARIA usage in the widgets, we tend to not need too much of it in our form controls, as we use the native controls in most cases, but there are a few places we're using ARIA for custom controls. The slider control for example, uses ARIA attributes, as does the custom select menu (but not the default selectmenu, as that's a normal select). There are some other places I'm probably forgetting...

Anyway, I'll get on that focus outline fixup. let me know if you have any feedback on the points above, and if you have any other ideas for improving our accessibility before 1.0 ships - it's a top priority for us!

Firstly to clarify I'm was describing an issue in my own wep app using jQueryMobile (http://fullmeasure.co.uk/OpenDirective/IPO/Final/) not your site.. In fact it seems I owe you an apology as I see the top element in the DOM after your lazy enhancement is in-fact an a element I must have got data blind and only saw the 2 spans. The 2 buttons I have may be an edge case as they are in header/footer. I cannot get  either to action with enter key, which is the real bug report.

Yes that is what I meant. Sorry not to be clear. It seemed an obvious uses case.  I have to apologise again as I now see the role= markup. All I can think is I did something to break the enhancement or firebug reporting at some point.

BTW I also tried using the HTML5 structural elements (header, content, aside) and it mostly worked with some CSS damage. I see the problem in supporting both the more specific HTML5 and general div is the CSS and jQuery selectors would become messy, and so probably inefficient.

I think the problem is that each time you load car_catalog.jsp you are adding another live() handler. What you should probably be doing is using die() (the opposite of live) to unregister your car_catalog.jsp live handler whenever pagehide is called ... and don't forget to also unregister your pagehide handler.

This bug was originally about the incorrect positioning of the footer after a scrolling past the document dimensions. You've mentioned a couple more bugs related to footers, the collapsible problem (which I fixed), and the tapping problem. I appreciate you reporting the problems, but where we can, let's try to file separate issues so we don't morph/hijack existing ones.

I don't have an time estimate at the moment, but we are trying to do what we can before 1.0 final.

Regarding the footer hiding accidentally when tapping on objects on the page, etc. That's the behavior that was originally implemented. I know its very problematic in some cases where clicks/taps on objects in the doc don't swallow the events they act on. Regarding the hide on scroll behavior, that too is intentional since we don't currently support sup-page scrolling.

2553,2012-02-29 09:02:08,"Hey all

I'm not positive, but I think this was configured better before this change - not sure it was actually a bug. While it's confusing that the checked attribute wasn't updating, I think that's actually expected behavior for properties like ""checked"", in which the attribute delivers an initial property value of the element, but after that, we'd update the property rather than the attribute. With that original system in place, to check the value, you could use prop() instead of attr()

We switched from attr() to prop() when jQuery core added the method, since in theory, prop should be used for manipulating properties like this after load. Now that it's using attr() again, I don't think the input's actual checked property is being updated anymore, and the new issue #3670 suggests as much. Setting the attribute may be sufficient for form submission 
(did we test that?), but I'm not sure it digs in to set the property itself.

By using attr() to change the value, jQuery's "":checked"" selector doesn't seem to find the property, but ""[checked]"" does, since we're updating the attribute. 

I noticed we still have the prop()-based version in the code, commented out beneath it. 

@wilto - I think this was a pull you might have approved... Maybe you could chime in on why we needed to change this back to attr()? I wonder if the following is the change we might need to make:



(before, in the commented-out code, the second call to prop there was using attr() instead, which may have been the real cause of the bug originally. maybe...)

2546,2011-09-27 18:49:43,"Hi @laustdeleuran

What version of jQuery Mobile are you guys using? For the record, we don't modify links, we modify the location hash for the browser after we've loaded external pages. When we load files via XHR, we are actually using normal URL paths. If the path contained in the link's href is a relative path, that path gets resolved against the source URL for the page that contains the link.

The reason I ask what version you guys are using is because the hash reference to an external page should be a site relative path. The example given above, and in the forum post:

index.html#page1.html

shouldn't be possible with the beta and newer versions of the framework. We moved to using site relative references because the framework sometimes could not distinguish between a file in the same directory as the application and an  id.

It might help if you or @vanthemaniac could give us an example of an application manifest listing the files involved, and then an example of the link markup that doesn't work. Also notating what file contains the link that doesn't work would help.

The pageinit event is _ALWAYS_ fired for every page that is in the initial document loaded in the browser, and for every page pulled in dynamically via AJAX. The issue folks are having here is that they are wanting to register event handlers that listen for pageinit from script in the external pages that are being loaded when the user navigates to it. The one requirement the framework has is that if you want JS in an external page to be executed, it has to be embedded within the page content of the external document. This is because the framework only uses the markup of the first page in the external document, and throws everything else away. It does this because it has to avoid reloading duplicate JS and CSS files that may be referred to in the external document.

To re-iterate, the pageinit event is being fired, the issue here is how folks register their callbacks.

I just did some testing in several browsers and they all handle the specific case of navigating to the same document while there are states on the history stack, differently. Some fire popstate events with the last active state, some don't. Some replace the current active state with the new document instance, others push a new history entry ... and of course all of this depends on the format of the URL being pushed (hash or no hash).

Is there some reason you need to link to your homepage.html with a rel=""external"" link, instead of just allowing the framework to navigate as it naturally would? If for some reason you _MUST_ use rel=""external"" then I have to suggest turning off the pushstate support within the framework for your usage as I did above with a mobilinit callback.

So you are recommending that allow the default behavior of data-dom-cache=""false"" and when the app needs to keep a page, in order not to reload it when the back button is pressed, prevent the 'pageremove'? Does the pageremove event have access to the same information as the page events (ui.nextPage)? I have only one page that  is dynamically cached, it is cached unless you return to the root.

Also I am not clear on how I can prevent caching of the first page loaded. By default it is cached. I have tried data-dom-cache=""false"" on the page before it is loaded but it did not work. If this is supposed to work then I will try it again. However this would mean I have to add data-dom-cache=""false"" to every single one of my pages just in case it is the first one loaded. I have only one page I want cached permanently which is the root page. 

In the way the cacheing has evolved it would seem to me that you should not cache any page unless specifically requested (data-dom-cache=""false""). Even embedded pages.

2329,2011-08-23 23:50:47,"Ok, so I debugged this on @jostster's system. the basic setup is that he has a listview with list items that when clicked, brings up an internal page with a form on it. There are several 'custom' selects on this page several of which are dialog selects, and the rest the small overlay select.

He programatically calls change page when a 'save' button is clicked, and the changePage request is for the page we came from. The culprit removing the form page is the pagehide callback registered from the select's close() function:



The 'this' reference in the callback is the page containing the actual select. I'm not familiar with that code, but I'm guessing it should be the custom select dialog that is getting removed. Right @jbender?
",jblas,jbender
2329,2011-08-24 00:16:53,"@jostster and @kinblas,

First, there's a bug fix in HEAD that only binds the remove when domcache allows it. That should give you a workaround in the short term.

The purpose of that rebinding is just as the comment says. We don't want to remove the page that a dialog comes from when we open said dialog, but we do want to remove that page when we go elsewhere so we disable it temporarily and then re-enable it. The dialog itself will be removed by the other pagehide.remove binding.

So:  



From what it the flow here appears to be



In which case the Form is being removed as we expect it to be. I would decorate the Form page with `data-dom-cache` false with the code from HEAD assuming I've understood the issue.

The reason you can't just refer to the id of a div in the main application page, from an external page, is because it violates the rules of graceful degradation. By that, I mean ... if your application is loaded in a browser where we've had to disable the AJAX functionality for some reason, the external page will get loaded as a new document in the browser.

There are a couple of options here with trade-offs.
1. Add our own `_init` implementation as in the patch I posted above. One downside here is if someone wants to extend the jquerymobile widget they need to juggle the init to preserve our events. I talked with @ajpiano and he said that in jqueryui 1.9 it will invoke the super method so we've be fine here in the future as long as we plan to upgrade the jqueryui widget factory. My only real concern is that someone, somewhere has extended the mobile widget, defined init, and will hate me for all eternity if I break their code.
2. Decorate the `_create` method with a follow up `_trigger( 'aftercreate' )`. Fragile and is generally not very robust in the face of change. I don't like monkeypatching/decorating it surprises people and me down the road.
3. Alter the `jquery.ui.widget.js` and add the `_trigger( 'aftercreate' )` to the end of the `_create` method after the call to `_init`. Downside being that we now have to manage changes to the ui widget vs our patch unless we decide talk with the ui guys and move it upstream. In the latter case it would actually be `_trigger( 'init' )` to follow on with the convention of calling `_trigger( 'create' )` after calling the `_create` method.

When you click on this link, jQM should:
- make the querystring available somehow in the ""pagebeforeshow"" event
- render #basepage, with the complete url (#basepage?city=a&state=b), so that it is bookmarkable
- update the history, so the back-button works properly
- work on all browsers

The problem I have is inconsistent behavior on different browsers, especially when clicking multiple links with different query strings...

Some have suggested that the solution is to render all possible pages on the server, each with their own unique

That approach would not work for me.

found elsewhere that in IE the submit event is actually attached to the

submit event is attached to the form.

I found some stuff about code that ""bubbles"" the submit event up to the form

2001,2011-09-29 18:21:23,"@scottjehl mentioned to me that jQuery 1.7 mentioned something about form event bubbling in the release notes. This made me take a look at the jQuery Core 1.6.4 implementation. Turns out that IE does not bubble form submit events so jQuery core executes some code that enables a special handling for submit bindings. When you bind to ""submit"" on IE, you are actually binding to ""click"" on submit buttons/images and a fake submit event is triggered in the click handler so that the event bubbles up the DOM hierarchy. This means our live() handler gets executed before the real submit event for the form is dispatched.

Looking at the implementation in jQuery core 1.7, it looks like they've tweaked this code a bit so that instead of firing the fake submit event on click ... they instead register a submit handler on the parent form of the button/image clicked, such that when the buttons are clicked, they wait till the form submit event dispatched from the browser is fired. The special form submit callback then kicks in and triggers the event on the parent of the form so that jQuery handles the bubbling manually.

We're shipping RC 1 today so this will probably have to wait till jQuery core 1.7 is released.

1) I need data-ajax=""false"" in the form tag. The issue wasn't that the
submit() wasn't being triggered, it was that after being triggered, the
built-in AJAX functionality would take over and post back to itself because
no action attribute is defined.

2) Hitting Enter from a text field when using input type=""submit"" doesn't
work, but using button type=""submit"" does work.

FYI I have a fix for the undefined problem. I'll check it in once I finish writing the unit tests  for it.

Regarding your issue with the redirect ... we can't tell when a redirect happens because the browser only calls us back _AFTER_ the redirect has happened so we have no clue that one occurred. That said we've been telling folks to place a data-url=""/tasks/list"" on their page element in the results.

So I'm still a bit confused about what we're talking about here. So is the issue you are trying to point out that if you visit test2.html, go back to the previous page, and then click on the testing2.html link again, that you see a loading message followed by a transition?

If so, the reason this happens is because externally loaded pages are tagged with an @data-url that is the site relative path to the file it came from. In this specific example, you are overriding this behavior by specifying a @data-url attribute on the page being loaded, and the value of that attribute is document relative. The intent of allowing folks to specify a data-url attribute on externally loaded pages is to provide a workaround for the case where the server does a redirect to an entirely different path on the server. I guess the code path to handle this case just uses whatever path is in the @data-url attribute as-is, so when we attempt to find the page the 2nd time, we get no match and think we need to reload the file.

I guess I can add code to that external page @data-url code path that resolves the URL relative to the original URL used to load the page ... which would fix your specific case which is really pointing at the same file, but this would do absolutely nothing for the original use case this was supposed to support, unless we get into tracking re-mapped URLs, which could be problematic if a server does conditional redirects.

... Sorry just thinking out loud here. :-)

1833,2011-06-15 22:25:54,"@scottjehl told me about this one:

If you load a JQM application, then navigate to another page, you see a slide transition. If you hit the browser back button, you see a reverse slide transition to the initial application page. If you then hit the browser's forward button, you are taken to the page you previously visited instantly with no transition.

Looking into it, the logic for calculating the transition to use in this situation is pretty much the same as it was prior to the navigation code refactor I did. The one difference is that the initial page used to have a boolean false value as its value for the transition property of its urlHistory stack entry. Now it has ""none"" so the old logic allows the ""none"" to be used as the transition for the new page.

CSS-based transitions already work well on many flavors of desktop Webkit and now Firefox 5 and will soon be pretty well supported. Most importantly, they tend to be hardware accelerated. We're going in that direction because they tend to be very smooth it's a a future-looking approach, not because this is mobile-focused. 

 If you do end up re-creating all the various transitions in JS, please do let us know and we can offer it as a plugin.

@matthewdl: Thanks for the feedback. We're working on recommendations for scaling the framework up to tablet and desktop, but so far the transitions were mostly targeted for the mobile browsers that supported them at the time we created them. Now that support has expanded, we aren't intentionally excluding any browsers from transitions, we just haven't gotten around to adding more prefixes for browsers that support our current setup (which is based on keyframes). We've had a ticket open for this for some time, and we're looking to add other prefixes soon. 

That said, we're not entirely sure how our transitions should play out by default in desktop browsers yet, since many of the transitions tend to feel distracting and unnatural in that environment for simple page changes (particularly the slide transitions). Since page transitions are more common in mobile browsing than the desktop web currently, we didn't see this as a major issue for beta 1, but we're starting to work on it now. Slight tangent, but on the new docs site, we've set our transitions differently depending on window width, moving to ""fade"" around 600px and up, and then to ""none"" at 1000 and up. We may experiment with this thinking in the coming weeks, and we'd love your feedback. 

Anyway, we're looking to broaden our transitions support now, ideally without adding too much bloat to the css. Maybe the suggestion above will be a good starting point to explore.

Then, as suggested from the other post: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issuesearch?state=open&q=custom+icons#issue/849 I added the following code to my separate CSS file:

@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),

       only screen and (min-resolution: 240dpi) {

This fixed the issue I was experiencing.  Yea!  Which leads me to ask, is there a way to call a custom data-icon name of your choice like we did with the buttons, but in the context of Collapsible Content?

Your example above illustrates a problem that caused me to hold-off on implementing the up-level references in the first place. When working with paths that are embedded within the HTML, folks don't always end directory references with a trailing slash.

So for example you have the path:



which internally gets translated to:



if we are then given:



We're not really sure if 12345 is a directory reference, or a document reference.

I've written a minimal page to reproduce the issue in two different ways.

Case 1:
1) http://ozten.com/random/jquery_mobile_select.html
2) Click Edit
3) Change Selector value
4) Click Done

Expected:
Returns to first screen
Actual: 
Loading error (Yellow alert)

Case 2:
1) http://ozten.com/random/jquery_mobile_select.html
2) Click ""@Context""
3) Click Edit
4) Change Selector value
5) Click Done

Expected:
Returns to ""Content"" page (#ct-1-page)

Actual: 
XHR request is made for ct-1-page which is a 404. No error dialog. On some platforms, the loading page overlay is left spinning.

Work-around: Removing data-rel=""dialog"" makes a normal page, which doesn't have this selector navigation issue.

904,2011-03-03 14:10:05,"Hi Everybody,

I posted this in another area that is currently closed (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1140#comment_803127), but thinking it's better suited here.  

In response to everyone's postings, thanks for all the great tips.  Here are the steps I took to fix my problem:

In the jQuery Mobile CSS: jquery.mobile-1.0a3.css, I commented out the following code:

@media screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), screen and (max--moz-device-pixel-ratio: 2) {
    .ui-icon {
    background-image: url(images/icons-36-white.png);
    background-size: 630px 18px;
}
    .ui-icon-black {
    background-image: url(images/icons-36-black.png);
}
}

Then, as suggested from the other post: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issuesearch?state=open&q=custom+icons#issue/849 I added the following code to my separate CSS file:

@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),
       only screen and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),
       only screen and (min-resolution: 240dpi) {
    .ui-icon-plus, .ui-icon-minus, .ui-icon-delete, .ui-icon-arrow-r, 
    .ui-icon-arrow-l, .ui-icon-arrow-u, .ui-icon-arrow-d, .ui-icon-check,
    .ui-icon-gear, .ui-icon-refresh, .ui-icon-forward, .ui-icon-back,
    .ui-icon-grid, .ui-icon-star, .ui-icon-alert, .ui-icon-info {
    background-image: url(images/icons-36-white.png);
    -moz-background-size: 558px 18px;
    -o-background-size: 558px 18px;
    -webkit-background-size: 558px 18px;
    background-size: 558px 18px;
}
    .ui-icon-black {
    background-image: url(images/icons-36-black.png);
}
}

This fixed my 'a' tags with a data-role of button and a custom data-icon, as referenced here: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a3/#docs/buttons/buttons-icons.html

However, it did not fix custom icons that I created for Collapsible Content: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a3/#docs/content/content-collapsible.html

Therefore, where I overwrote ""ui-icon-plus"" and ""ui-icon-minus"" in my separate CSS file, I included the background size of my custom sprite as follows:



This fixed the issue I was experiencing.  Yea!  Which leads me to ask, is there a way to call a custom data-icon name of your choice like we did with the buttons, but in the context of Collapsible Content?  For example, instead of overwriting the ""ui-icon-plus"" and ""ui-icon-minus,"" as I did in my separate CSS.  I think it would be great to keep these consistent across the board, so no matter what data-role you're using, you'll always have the ability to append a data-icon of your choice.  Thoughts?

For opera mini, the pre tag just needed some CSS to force word wrapping.  This is a bug in the doc's own css file, not in jquery mobile.  Perhaps this should be considered for inclusion in the main theme file, though?

For opera desktop, @miketaylr tipped me off to a bug in opera where if the border width and positioning value exceed 32767px, a wide horizontal scroll bar will appear.  Reducing left/top positioning values down to 9999 fixes it.  Weird stuff.

Judging from the comments here and the fact that using the jqm emulation produces the desired result it sounds like everyone expects this to be a post orientationchange event. That is an event that is triggered when the orientation changes and the document element size has been altered. The docs are actually ambiguous as to whether the orientation value will be pre/post change.

> Triggers when a device orientation changes (by turning it vertically or horizontally). When bound to this event, your callback function can leverage a second argument, which contains an orientation property equal to either ""portrait"" or ""landscape"". These values are also added as classes to the HTML element, allowing you to leverage them in your CSS selectors. Note that we currently bind to the resize event when orientationChange is not natively supported.

There's a case to be made for having an orientation change event that fires _before_ the document element has resized, but for now after I double check with the team I'll look into making the current `orientationchange` event include the post resize orientation value and clarifying the documentation a bit.

This doesn't address the issue of the event firing _before_ the screensize has changed on Android but at least the user will get the correct value from `event.orientation`.

Yah, I noted that in the message before the commit. The change only gets the user the right value, but because the different browsers fire the event at different times, most importantly _after_ the resize has occurred, we don't have an easy way of making sure the event happens when the screen is the right size. We might address this post 1.0, but not before.

@samnan9

We'll hopefully try and address the quirks here but the combination of the event firing many times per orientation change in conjunction with the poor consistency in timing is going to make it difficult if not impossible. For sure this won't be fixed before 1.0.

There was a bug in beta1 where we were firing off our ajax/page-transitioning on vclick, but due to quirky event implementation differences between the platforms it was hard for us to catch the synthesized clicks that follow. This is the cause of the 2nd ghost click you were seeing.

For beta2 we went back to our old strategy of updating visually on vclick and doing the ajax/page-transitions on the click event which is really the only way to work somewhat reliably on all the platforms and avoid the quirks/bugs.

455,2011-10-26 20:35:17,"@blnight

Your not the first to ask for this option, and perhaps we should consider a way to turn it off via a config option. The problem that @toddparker was referring to above was that without doing the ""scroll to the top"", transitions to new pages will result in a change in the document height ... the problem is different browsers do different things when this happens. Some stay at the current scroll offset even when the document height is less than that offset, resulting in what looks like a blank page, while others will adjust accordingly showing you the bottom of the new page content. Aside from this problem, it just looks wierd to see a transition that doesn't involve the top of a document.

Believe me when I say we have tried several times to figure out how to make this smoother, for example offsetting the rendering of the new page by the current scroll position during the transition, etc ... but we always get bitten by blinky/flashing rendering when we fix the scroll position for the new page because the browser thinks it hasn't rendered that part of the document.

I just wanted to give you a feeling of the types of issues you may come up against if we give an option to turn this behavior off.

For instance, we may want to perform 'our things' (fetching data from the internet, client side rendering, etc) in the background, before page transitions, in order to speed things up.
However there are certain cases that require the page to be fully shown, because our javascript enhanced widgets (or google maps for that matter) don't work if the dom is hidden or with display:none.
The only way to achieve this behaviour is using page events.

So, I think that the current proposed solution (supporting parameters in the hash part of the url and using page events to access the pageUrl) is enough to play with dynamically generated pages.

I think I see where the disconnect is with this issue ... the original issue was reported at a time when we were actually dropping query params when placing the path of an external page inside the hash. That bug has been fixed a while back. There have been other folks in this bug and other related bugs ... which some have been closed, not by me, in fact I wasn't involved in any of those discussions ... where folks are asking for the ability to specify query params for embedded pages.

I personally have been trying to make things easier for developers. I was the one that added the path parsing code that made it easier to parse URLs properly, even in the case when urls had query params and hashes in the document fragment of the URL. All of that is available in $.mobile.path.

That said, I'm still wondering what you are asking for. Are you asking for a utility function that can allow quick lookup of a given query parameter in a URL you supply? Or are you asking for the ability to pass data to an embedded page as a query string in the hash? In either case, we really need to file separate issues.

I'm sensing some frustration from folks. I'm willing to help, all I'm asking is for folks to file issues that clearly explain what problems they are having, and to help us with the details since not everyone is doing things the same way or proposing the same thing.

450,2011-10-21 00:49:02,"@andyl: I'm using the same url schema for many applications and it seems to work properly.

I totally agree that using the ""pagechange technique"", as described in the official doc, is quite ""ugly"" since it's nothing but an hack, but I'm **_incredibly grateful**_ to that someone who made this possible, since we've something reliable and officially supported now.

I suggest you develop or use a plugin that implements that ""hack"" in your application, because writing that thing every single time is quite boring.

As for the $.mobile.urlget() function proposed by @IJay, I'm not sure it should be included in the framework, at least not in that way.

The basic problem with jquery mobile is that it lacks an official hash router (cfr: backbone.js and sencha touch) for dynamic pages, although it's quite simple to write one now that hash parameters are supported.
Without a router, every single developer will ""cook"" his own solution, leading to a total mess and that frustration @jblas was talking about.

450,2011-10-21 01:42:57,"Until we get something similar in the framework, I think it's a viable option.

The only problem is that it's built around my needs only, so it might be quite 'strange' to someone who's not used to work with Backbone.js, or simply is not familiar with javascript MVC routing.

I've tried to simplify things for people who don't want to learn regular expression by providing an utility to convert an hash with parameters to an object, which is quite close to the function @IJay proposed a few posts above.

If anybody still cares about this, I created a simple plug-in which allows you to pass and maintain URL parameters within embedded jQuery Mobile pages for the multi-page template. It works well but could probably use some touch-ups and improvements...which I'll do if people ask for them & time permits..or people can also contribute. You can find the plug-in here..

431,2010-11-11 17:20:47,"I checked out the git-repository (1.0a2pre) a few hours ago and have been trying some features following the docs. 

Setting: I used the minimal files for css and js which I got after executing 'make' and the core jquery.min.js from js/ and copied the default theme images to my folder.

When using button icons no icons occured although images were at the right place. 
After has been working with js/jquery.js I executed the google closure compiler creating a new jquery.min.js which helped. 
Also http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.3.min.js which is proposed in the docs does not seem to work with button icons. 

Therefore I would suggest adding a compilation feature in Makefile which could look like:
@@head -8 js/jquery.js > jquery.js
@@java -jar build/google-compiler-20100917.jar --js js/jquery.js --warning_level QUIET --js_output_file jquery.min.js

339,2013-05-01 15:52:21,"@uGoMobi Here's the relevant [Rails documentation for checkboxes](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-check_box).

It outputs a hidden field followed by a checkbox of the same name. The order matters. If the checkbox isn't checked, the value of the hidden field becomes the default. If the checkbox is checked, then that value is used. I haven't dug into what exactly what JQM is doing, but when it's augmenting a checkbox, these two fields can end up in the wrong order. If the hidden field comes after the checkbox, the checked value will never be used.

Again, I'm not entirely sure why placing a label after the checkbox has an impact on JQM's behaviour. The problem is that the location of the label in the code does not impact how the checkbox is rendered, so it looks like it will work, even when it doesn't. It's also the case that every other control typically has the label before the form field, so it seems natural to put the label before a checkbox (given the same rendering).

93,2010-10-04 21:39:29,"Interesting.
It would be nice if we could just use an existing ID if it's available, but then we won't be able to deep link to that page through a hash (the ID always matches the hash 1-to-1).

Do you think it would be okay to recommend that people add another wrapper div inside the @data-role=""page"" div and put the ID on that?

We could also consider using data-id's for the deep-linking, but that would really fall apart without JS (at least with the current system, non-js users can be deep-linked to content that's in the DOM at load).

Related: we need to escape dynamically generated ID values so that they are valid ID attribute values.
