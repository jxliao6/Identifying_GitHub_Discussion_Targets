487,2016-12-01 10:14:43,"Hi all!

I've created a localized version of the slate keyboard layout for [qwertz_de keyboards here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-holger/slate_qwertz_de/master/ASCIIToCode_Qwertz_de.plist).

As ""dumb"" testing (i.e. replacing the ASCIIToCode.plist with my file) worked fine I wanted to fork the slate repo and create a proper ""enhancement"" to contribute to slate, I'm running into problems however:

- Cloned repo and opened project file in XCode
- Dragged and dropped my plist to Slate/Common and copying it there
- Added new layout to Common/Constants.[m|h] and Config/Binding.m
- (Fixed two deprecations in JSONkit.m automatically)
- Built & ran Slate => 
  - ""Unrecognized Key"" for my additions
  - My plist is missing from the Contents/Resources folder (even though it's included in ""Copy Bundle Resources"").

Anyway, hope the keyboard layout is of use. If anybody has a hint what I am missing here I'd be happy to learn!

Cheers!
Holger

So this might not be a Slate problem as such. Still, I would be very interested if someone had a hunch why Slate was affected by an Emacs setting. Did it create a lot of windowing data that Slate had to slog through? Did it add any hooks? Emacs doesn't have accessibility access.

2. Change the apps locations on that desktop or e.g. close all apps 
3. Recover the complete desktop that display all windows arranged in the way as of step #1

Any chance to do that (with slate or something else)?

So far, I have configured my .slate.js like that:

Saving and activating works as such but obviously there is no reliable way to do it for a specific desktop. Say save desktop 2 (via snapshot), save desktop 3 (via snapshot) and so on .... and then e.g. only recover say Desktop 3.

I think Slate should provide same way to arrange and resize windows as tmux (combination of keys after toggle) **or** kind of idea of language to manipulate windows - like VIM does for text objects: In series of keystrokes.

This way there is much less possibilities to interfere shortcuts in other programs and it would be much easier to remember how to command window-manager.

I am not really sure why this is happening:

EXCEPTION: TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'rec.width)

My end goal is to eliminate all the slate.operations and have one function that can split screens according to a gridlike arrangement. DivisionX and Y represent the split in width and height and indexX and Y represent the position of the window within this grid.

Though somehow it does not like `rect.width;` which I have tried acquiring with both slate.window().screen(); and slate.screen();

This over my macbook pro connected to a cinema display. So I am hopping to be able target the screen using the same code that is in `whichScreen`.

Please let me know what I have done that is incorrect. Thank you.

Hi @jigish,

First of all thanks for your awesome work. I thank you in my head each time I'm triggering my layout adjustment command :)
I've tried every window manager I've found for OS X & the one you did is still the best we can find these days. JavaScript configuration file is just the icing on the cake !

According to your GitHub activity I understand that you are pretty busy with other stuff in your life than this application (& that's a good thing for you). However I saw over there so many issues & pull requests that I'm wondering about the evolution of this app. I don't like to see apps I like & use to start going down because the maintainer is a busy man (I am a busy man too, we all are & that's good for our lifes).

So what about to cherry pick some people to give them write access in this repos? It can be a good thing to keep the project up to date with the OS & community needs.
I know this idea seems crazy, but I really think this can be a good thing for your project. You can keep an eye over there & give your opinion (I am sure you still are interested by the project).
You can also just say ""yes please do that"" or ""no I don't want that for this app"". You can still be the leader of course.

Please think about this idea :)

First of all, my apologies for being _very_ absent over the past couple of years. I've had some serious work-life balance issues and only been contributing to projects I've used for work. That has changed, though.

It has been a while since I first wrote Slate and am planning on pushing a complete rewrite to my github (probably with in ~2 weeks). As it is a complete rewrite, Slate2 will not support many features up front and the config has changed quite a bit. In addition I'm thinking about supporting only Yosemite+ with Slate2. That being said, I will be committing to it very actively to bring it up to speed with Slate.

As far as this version of Slate is concerned I'm happy to do any of the following:
1. add a pointer to @mattr-'s fork to the readme
2. merge a large pull request and give write access to @mattr- 

either works for me, but I will be putting a pointer to Slate2 on the readme once I push it to my github.

again, apologies for my absence.
",jigish,
437,2015-06-02 22:34:14,"Another option would be to commit the rewrite into this repository and add a pointer in the readme to @mattr-'s fork for anyone who wants the original slate.

",jigish,
437,2015-06-02 23:05:31,"@jigish
- +1 for the Yosemite+ requirement.
- Is your upcoming rewrite in Swift?
- Are you going to use the `JSContext` class instead of a hidden WebView?
- You might wanna ask for some volunteer contributors who can help clean up the Github Issues that have accumulated and maybe help with the readme.
",sdegutis,
437,2015-06-02 23:07:32,"@jigish Also, feel free to use https://github.com/sdegutis/WindowManager as a baseline for your rewrite if you choose Swift.
",sdegutis,
437,2015-06-02 23:29:35,"yes to Swift and `JSContext`. I actually have a lot of the basics written already, just need to implement to more complex stuff. I'll definitely take a look at WindowManager -- thanks!

If we decide to maintain the original Slate here then I'd suggest just wiping all github issues and pull requests with a generic ""I'm wiping this please reopen if it is still an issue"" message.
",jigish,
437,2015-06-03 00:52:16,"@jigish Also, one approach that might be worth considering is to use Lua instead of JS. Lua is very similar to JS semantically, but much easier to integrate with than JSContext. Plus, Apple's rules around converting structures to/from JS are not super well defined, and there are times it will do a different thing than expected. Plus, the ObjC API for it does not integrate with Swift classes, you have to write NSObject-based classes with them. Since Lua has a C API, I wrote a Swift wrapper as https://github.com/sdegutis/lua4swift which you can use if you want. Just throwing it out there as a possibility.
",sdegutis,
437,2015-06-04 01:41:31,"@jigish I'm happy to continue maintaining this version of Slate, so however you want to handle the rewrite, whether in this repo or in a separate repo, it doesn't really matter to me. :smiley:

I know GitHub support is generally happy to do those sorts of things for us.
",mattr-,
437,2015-06-05 15:04:48,"@sdegutis If you (or anyone) is wanting to go the Lua route, I would recommend just checking out [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) and building from there. I've actually already started a pseudo slate rewrite (similar config principles) and would be happy to work with you in going that route. Lmk if your interested and I can push up my project to GitHub.

I use both 10.6.8 and 10.9.5 (soon 10.10.3) depending on what software I need to use, so I look forward to installing Slate2 on my Yosemite partition, but I'm going to continue using Slate on my preferred version of OS X.

435,2014-12-04 17:50:15,"# Main issue

I have bindings set up to allow me to switch between multiple windows with the same key stroke. These switch to the next available app that is open (ultimately, I'd like to also rotate between all open windows in an app...but not yet). Here is the code:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This works in nearly all cases (that I've tested). Unfortunately, there seem to be a few instances where the binding passes an `undefined` window object, for example when a window was just minimized. It also happens in some apps (_cough_ Texmaker _cough_) even when the window is in focus; I suspect this has something to do with the way separate panels are coded/handled by the app.

The following code put at the beginning of `rotateFocus` bypasses the problem:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
# Aside

I ended up using `success` to check for window switching, which I is the best option; however, I naively began by testing the app name after the focus had switched: `win.app().name()`. However, the window object is not updated after the action. I am not sure if this is intended behavior, but I wanted to point it out. I can create a new issue if needed.

This second one does not work, the hint icons will overlap:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I suppose this means that calling bind will create a function for the current configuration of the file up to that point, but someone familiar with the source would have to confirm.

After doing some work to get the subshell to stick around and give me information about its env, it doesn't look like a proper subshell at all.

As a result, many commands that I could otherwise use in my bash shell cannot be used from within slate.

Thoughts? Solutions? Is there a fork or PR somewhere with better shell support?
",mathias,
417,2014-07-31 04:02:20,"I haven't looked at this particular part of the code, but I'm pretty sure that the shell being used to execute these commands is a restricted subshell, meaning that it won't pull in any of your normal initialization files such as `.bashrc`, `.profile`, etc. The best way that I know of to address this at the moment is to create a script that you can call out to via a full path that is self-contained (meaning it pulls in, sets, or otherwise manipulates the shell environment how it sees fit in order to run whatever it needs to run).

Hopefully that sheds some light on the issue. I'm not a aware of another fork or a PR that adds the better shell support that you're looking for.

One issue is that to use this on different machines, I can't hardcode the absolute path to my dotfile's scripts dir since it might live in a different user's home directory.

Oddly enough, a path like `~/bin/foo` does seem to work occasionally, provided that shell script doesn't try to shell out to anything else. Sourcing .bashrc and/or RVM's\* `~/.rvm/scripts/rvm` script doesn't work. (*since I was trying to use Ruby and thought it was an issue with Ruby gemsets, but have since given that up)
",mathias,
417,2014-10-23 20:34:58,"have you determined which shell you are using?

Wrapping everything you need to run in `bash -c ""your stuff here""` might help you get around this.

unresponsive apps.

Tested by pausing Google Chrome with a command like `kill -STOP 11019`,
then interacting with Slate (using hot keys to reposition windows). I
observed that there is some lag before the `CGSEventIsAppUnresponsive`
API actually registers the state of the world; it returns `false` at
first, but after about 20 seconds it correctly returns `true`. During
the initial interval, interacting with Slate is laggy; after that, it
becomes snappy.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

There are a couple issues with those lines. The problem seems to be that the
window tries to resize before moving, and OSX prevents them from overflowing on
the right or bottom of the screen (only when resizing, nudging works fine). This
means that if the right edge of your window touches the right edge of the
screen, the first line will not work. If the bottom edge of your window touches
the bottom edge of the screen, the second line will not work.

If you move the window away from the right/bottom edge, but less than 10% of
thre screen size (as encoded in the above commands), the increase will be capped
by the distance to the edge. So having the right edge of the window 10px away
from the right edge of the window means the window can only grow by 10px at a
time on the left.

Here are alternative commands that give the correct behaviour:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This does however leaves us in this state:
- When trying to grow the window to overlap the bottom or right of the screen, nothing happens (this is okay).
- You can grow a window to overlap to the left of the screen, it works (which is okay-ish, but inconsistent with behaviour of bottom and right).
- When trying to grow the window to overlap to the top of the screen, it is instead nudge in that direction by the amount it should be grown by. This is weird.

The first two bullet point are not a consequence of the alternative commands, while the third is.

356,2013-10-26 18:20:34,"Finder on Mavericks has in interesting new behaviour: when you tell it to move or resize a window via Slate, Finder will actually animate the change, showing the window gliding over from its original to new location (or stretching out to its new size).

Unfortunately, this seems to interfere with commands that _both_ resize and move the window; if a Slate move command requires the window to both change in size and in location, only one of the two will actually take effect. Splitting it into two separate commands (using separate calls to win.resize() and win.move() in JS) doesn't solve the issue. My (untested, uninformed) guess is that Finder's animation is only capable of one transformation at a time, and as long as it's still animating one change, it's discarding calls to perform other window moves/resizes.

If `orderScreensLeftToRight` is set to false, the screen ID is the Mac OS internal ID (indexed at 0). If `orderScreensLeftToRight` is set to false but you still want to reference screens in the default ordered mode, prefix the screen ID with `ordered:`.

So something like `runOrRaise(""Emacs"", function (w) { return w.title() == ""foo.org""; })` would focus the Emacs frame currently displaying the `foo.org` buffer.

One other note -- the `Snap` binding has a behavior that changes.  If the dock app is not running, it starts.  If the dock app is not the current app, it becomes current.  If it is the current app, then it is hidden.  The `focus` behavior of Slate is a little different in that it will always focus the app regardless of whether it's current or not.

I've been using Slate on my MacBook air for a while, and it works perfectly, including when I had second monitors connected (a Dell and a Ben Q).

I would like to implement pie menus for Slate in JavaScript/HTML. 
It would be great to be able to do something like this:

http://www.donhopkins.com/home/movies/TabWindowDemo.mov

To that end, I am playing around with exposing the WebView that Slate uses for its JavaScript interpreter. 

Instead of making a hidden WebView in JSController.m, I am making a window in MainWindow.xib, plugging it into SlateAppDelegate, and grabbing it from the JSController.m initialization code. 

So Slate's JavaScript interpreter can create HTML user interfaces in the WebView in the window. 

I need to write some wrappers to make it possible for JavaScript to control the window, show, hide, position, bring to top, etc. 

And also it would be great to figure out how to make a transparent window that only shows through where HTML draws, leaving the background of the web page transparent. 

I'm not sure how easy that is, but it's worth doing if possible. 

It would also be great to flesh out the accessibility and speech recognition APIs, and make it possible to write all kinds of intelligent application automation and integration scripts, bots, with nice HTML user interfaces in JavaScript. Take a look at what Dragon Naturally Speaking has done with Python: 

https://code.google.com/p/dragonfly/

Here are some thoughts and opinion I wrote about window managers, stuff I've done in the past with older systems, and the direction I would like to take Slate, from a discussion on Hacker News:

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5861229

X-Windows is a dead end (and has been for a long time), and X window managers are as complex and dug into a pit of pointless complexity as the Space Shuttle.

There are a lot of good reasons to have a scriptable window manager, with a scripting language tightly integrated with the window system.

When I started hacking X10, I wanted to implement pie menus for it. There was a cheezy little library called ""XMenu"" that was intended for other programs to use to make menus, which I adapted for pie menus, but no programs actually used it, and it was not very configurable (no menu definition language, just an api), plus its model and api was not well suited for pie menus. And once you have menus, you need a way to make selecting their items actually do something!

So I adapted the ""uwm"" window manager to support pie menus, so you could define your own pie menus and linear menus in your .uwmrc file. Because a window manager could really benefit from pie menus: lots of the commands are spatially oriented and can be arranged in appropriate mnemonic directions, and they have a fixed set of common window management commands that can be thoughtfully arranged into a set of efficient pie menus, as well as a menu definition language to enable users to create custom menus for running apps, connecting with remote hosts, etc.

I wanted to experiment with different styles of menu tracking, mouse ahead, display pre-emption, feedback, screen edge handling, rolling between pie menus and linear menus, invoking window management commands, and stuff like that, and uwm's C code was not very flexible in that regard.

We also wanted to perform a controlled experiment comparing the selection time and error rate of pie menus and linear menus, so I needed to program the window manager to administer the experiment, define and randomize the menus, prompt the user to select from pie and linear menus, time the menu selections, report the statistics, etc.
I had been using Mitch Bradley's ""Forthmacs"", which was a very nice Forth system for the 68k. (It eventually evolved into the Sun 4 Forth boot ROMS, OpenFirmware, and the OLPC boot ROMs). It was capable of dynamically linking in C code (well not dll's or shared libraries, but it would actually call the linker to relocate the code to the appropriate place in Forth's address space, read in the relocated code, and write Forth wrappers, so you could call C code from Forth, pass parameters, etc -- SunOS 4.2 didn't have relocatable shared libraries or light weight threads back then, so Forth had to do a lot of the heavy lifting to plug in C code. But Forth was a really great way to integrate a library into an interactive extension language, call it from the Forth command line, build on top of C code in Forth, call back and forth between C and Forth, play around with it from the Forth command line, etc).

So I refactored UWM a bit so I could plug it into Forth and rewrite the main loop and event tracking code in Forth, and write higher level menu tracking and window management code in Forth, and administer the experiment in Forth. For example, you could pick up a window and throw it, and it would fork off a light weight Forth task to make it bounce around on the screen! See the ""fling"" code: 

http://www.donhopkins.com/home/archive/piemenu/uwm1/hacks.f

I didn't realize it at the time, but it foreshadowed what I would later do with NeWS and PostScript.

It was very nice to have a window manager that I could program in Forth, because that was my scripting language of choice at the time, and I could integrate it with C code and Xlib. But then I learned about SunDew aka NeWS (I read the SunDew article in Methodology of Window Management: http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/inf/literature/books/wm/... and saw Gosling give a talk about it at SUG).

I visited James Gosling, David Rosenthal, Owen Densmore and Mitch Bradley at Sun, who showed me NeWS, and gave me a beta copy to play around with. I learned to program PostScript, and switched from Forth to PostScript for programming windows managers, pie menus and user interfaces. PostScript is a much better language for that than Forth, not only because it has a nice graphics model, but because it's a lot more like Lisp or Smalltalk than Forth, and NeWS extended it with an object oriented programming system that used the dictionary stack to implement inheritance, with which we built user interface toolkits and entire apps, like a visual PostScript programming environment and debugger: 

http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/?q=node/97

NeWS was architecturally similar to what is now called AJAX, except that NeWS coherently:
- used PostScript code instead of JavaScript for programming.
- used PostScript graphics instead of DHTML and CSS for rendering.
- used PostScript data instead of XML and JSON for data representation.

Some years passed, NeWS was canceled, some other stuff happened, the web came along, the Mac stopped sucking so badly and adopted Unix and NeXT Step, the term AJAX was coined to describe what NeWS was doing all along and what X refused to do for political reasons, and JavaScript took over the world.

So back to real-time: I just recently installed and read the source code of a nice Mac tiling window manager called ""Slate"": https://github.com/jigish/slate . It look very clean and well designed and even simple, and I think it has a lot of potential! You can program it in JavaScript (it makes an invisible web browser and injects a JavaScript API to the application into it, and delivers events to JavaScript when windows move or change state, calling JavaScript handlers that can call back and manipulate the windows to achieve tiling window layout, and so on and so forth), and it exposes some of the Mac's accessibility API to JavaScript, which brings a lot of power to the table.

Slate is very powerful and flexible, and I'd like to teach it to support pie menus (and other user interface widgetry, maybe by simply popping a web browser up in a window), so you can define pie menus in JSON for window and application management or whatever you want, and script their behavior in JavaScript, and manipulate windows and apps via the accessibility API from JavaScript. Maybe throw in an http server so your window manager can surface web pages and interactive user interfaces in web browsers (that would be a good way to implement pie menus in JavaScript and html, instead of coding them up in Objective C).

I think that Slate takes exactly the right approach with JavaScript, and I hope to get my head around it and do some work with it, like making pie menus for window management, app launching and controlling the accessibility API.
",SimHacker,
322,2013-06-26 23:51:28,"Well I got it to use the web browser in the window of the ui file, so I can display html in it! I had to comment out the line:
[[webView mainFrame] loadHTMLString:@"""" baseURL:NULL];
from JSController.m because that was happening asynchronously and stomping on the stuff I put into the window. 
And I was able to make the web view and window float on top and be transparent except for the html content like this:

  SlateAppDelegate *appDelegate = (SlateAppDelegate *)[NSApplication sharedApplication].delegate;
  NSWindow *browserWindow = appDelegate.browserWindow;
  browserWindow.opaque = NO;
  browserWindow.level = kCGPopUpMenuWindowLevel;
  browserWindow.backgroundColor = [NSColor clearColor];

  webView = appDelegate.browserWebView;
  webView.drawsBackground = NO;

So now I can start coding up some pie menus in javascript, and fill in the rest of the api I need to show and hide and resize and position the browser window, and capture the mouse clicks of course, to implement pop-up pie menus for Slate! And whatever else is convenient. 
Maybe it would work to make the browser window big enough and positioned over the entire set of screens, and draw stuff in absolute screen coordinates, to implement any kind of overlay feedback (window dragging rubber bands, etc). Don't know if it would perform well, but that would make it easier to do a bunch of different user interface widgetry at the same time all in the same webview without them interfering with each other. 
",SimHacker,
322,2013-06-28 19:56:34,"Making the transparent browser window big enough to cover both screens works like a charm! 

One thing I don't know if it's currently possible is to bind mouse clicks to Slate functions -- it only seems to use the names of keys, not mouse buttons. 

But even without that feature, I think an easy way to pop up pie menus in response to click events is to draw some html over or adjacent to the window that you can click on to get the pie menu, and handle all the input tracking in the web browser itself. 

Mouse events that happen over non-transparent parts of the web browser are delivered to the browser, so it should work just fine. 

But it would be nice for the purposes of pie menus to be able to capture mouse clicks (with shift modifiers or without) on windows, and even conditionally pass them on to the app if they're not interesting. Any idea how to do that? 

I've been looking at the accessibility stuff, to figure out what kind of stuff Slate can make applications do, but I haven't dug really deep yet. 

Does the JavaScript/Objective C bridging magic automatically let you get and set properties and call methods on the Objective C Accessibility objects from JavaScript, and drill down to their children? 

Or would more wrappers need to be written to support that? 

There's a lot of surface area to the accessibility API, so it would be great if the bridging was automatically handled, so I didn't have to write millions of wrappers. 

Although it might be necessary to define some of the constants from the .h files in JavaScript at least.

I am excited about the possibilities of being able to implement Slate user interfaces in HTML/JavaScript!

322,2013-07-01 02:47:50,"The windowMoved and windowResized notifications to JavaScript were passing in an app wrapper instead of a window wrapper, so I fixed RunningApplications windowChanged to check for kAXWindowCreatedNotification, kAXWindowMovedNotification, kAXWindowResizedNotification, kAXWindowMiniaturizedNotification, kAXWindowDeminiaturizedNotification, kAXMovedNotification and kAXResizedNotification and in those cases call runWindowJSCallbacks (which sends a JSWindowWrapper parameter instead of a JSApplicationWrapper parameter) instead of calling JSController runCallbacks:payload: (which sends a JSApplication parameter), and also I added notification for kAXWindowMiniaturizedNotification and kAXWindowDeminiaturizedNotification. 

I have punched holes in JSWindowWrapper to expose its AccessibilityWrapper, and in AccessibilityWrapper to support manipulating its AXUIElementRef window, including the methods actionNames, performAction:, attributeNames, getAttributeValue:, getAttributeValueCount:, getParameterizedAttributeValue:parameter:, isAttributeSettable:, setAttributeValue:value:, postKeyboardEventKeyChar:virtualKey:keyDown:, and implemented webScriptNameForSelector: and webScriptNameForKey: so they replace :'s in selectors with _'s, so you can call the methods easily from JavaScript.

I'm running slate 1.0 on 10.8.3 on a MacBook Pro Retina 15'.

At work I use an external monitor and the internal one. Unfortunately the screen ids of these monitors are switching randomly. So I have to adjust it in .slate and restart slate.

Does anybody have an idea why this switching occurs?

Eclipse released a javascript plugin named VJET (http://www.eclipse.org/vjet/). It allows to extend the plugin by introducing typelibs (https://github.com/eclipse/vjet.typelibs).

1. Install emacs-mac-app 4.1_0 (latest version for the moment of bug submission).
2. Launch EmacsApp, open two windows.
3. Click ""Take snapshot"" in slate menu.
4. Click ""Activate snapshot"" in slate menu.

The result is that both emacs windows move onto exactly the same location, one on top of another (while they should obviously remain in place).

alias irc 'Colloquy'
alias skype 'Skype'

alias cl layout ChatLayout
alias tl layout TerminalLayout

${tl} BEFORE show ${term}

bind 2:cmd;alt ${tl}

At this point, both ""cl"" and ""tl"" are very similar. However, when i activate the ""cl"" layout, I also want my skype and irc apps to appear on the screen. 

So my first idea would be to append a ""show"" command to the AFTER clause of ""cl"", similar to the example for the layout directive.

${cl} AFTER hide all-but:${chrome} | show ${irc},${skype}

However, this does not show irc or skype. Adding a second AFTER clause does the trick
${cl} AFTER show ${irc},${skype}

Example:

Let's say that we call the modes `focus next` and `focus prev`. If we have windows arranged like this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

then `focus next` would focus the windows in the following order: `A -> B -> C -> A -> ...`, and vice versa for `focus prev` (notice that it wraps around).

So, I am creating a new issue. Feel free to delete/close this, if it makes sense]

I love Slate. But with some many configurations possible, one soon starts to run out of _convenient_ hotkeys that don't conflict with global ones or those used by other apps. 

And so, allowing Fn as a modifier (with all the combinations possible by combining it with other modifiers), would really be super helpful. And, at the current point, it might be _the_ single-most important feature that enables users to  make Slate an effortless part of their window management workflow -- for any and all types of window management tasks.

FWIW, using KeyRemap4MacBook allows one to bind to the Fn+key or Fn+modifier(s)+key type shortcuts. Even on Mountain Lion. Which means that it should be possible, in theory, for Slate to be able to allow Fn based based bindings as well.
",himanshu0,
262,2013-03-06 19:38:15,"The core functionality of KeyRemap4MacBook is provided as a kernel extension. This presents a vastly different model of installation and authorization than Slate: Launching the Slate app vs launching the KeyRemap4MacBook installer, providing admin credentials, going through the installation procedure, and then rebooting (after which you are at risk of provoking kernel panics). Don't get me wrong, KeyRemap4MacBook is great; but it's a different class of tool. I doubt it would be worthwhile for Slate to make the same sort of compromises. Plus, there's nothing stopping you from using them together.

FWIW, using Slate's `modal-key`s can help greatly with available bindings.
",SethMilliken,
262,2013-03-08 15:09:13,"@SethMilliken: Agree with you for the most part. However, KeyRemap4MacBook requires admin privileges only once, during installation. So as far as inconvenience goes (ignoring security aspects), its hardly an issue. Also, it might be worth investigating if admin privileges are required specifically for the Fn functionality (though I have a hunch it they would be, as well).
Using modal-key is a great option, I agree. I did not know about it, so thanks! But its not as seamless as an action that did not require switch modes etc.
Regarding using KeyRemap with Slate: Not a bad idea (I had thought earlier of doing that myself), but it still requires hotkeys to first be created using Slate, and mapping other (Fn-based) ones to those using KeyRemap. And these Slate hotkeys could still conflict/potentially conflict with other hotkeys, unless one choses really random/weird combinations that are unlikely to be used by the system/other app... but that's far from an ideal solution as far as I am concerned.

Having said that, I agree that you make useful points. If gigish/anyone else authorized to do so feels that the issue should be closed, they can go ahead and do that.

Suppose I have the following key bindings:

Currently, these two are equivalent and will be activated when one enters modal mode using cmd+f9 and then presses the upwards arrow.

I think the desired behaviour would be if the first syntax did exactly that while the second syntax would be triggered by entering modal mode using simply f9 and then pressing cmd+up.

Same goes for all other `push` commands I’ve tried (`push up`, `push down`, `push left`, `push right`; However, I’ve not tried using any of the optional params (`style` and `screen` or the `direction` values `top` and `bottom`).

Slate 1.0.24

Every time I restart, the window hints key seemingly isn't bound, but the other keys (like moving windows) are. If I click on Slate's menubar icon and select About Slate or Current Window Info, nothing happens.

I think what's actually happening is that Slate's windows are somehow not showing or in a hidden state.

If I then select ""Check for updates"", all of Slate's previously-hidden windows (e.g. Get Info) suddenly appear, and the window hints start working.

I'll try to whip up a quick test page with some mocks of the `slate` object functions so people can test out their `.slate.js` to make sure it is syntactically correct. As of right now the best way to do this is `slate.log` and trolling the OS X Console :) while running Slate.

214,2013-01-24 15:50:04,"Right now it seems that issuing multiple 'focus behind' commands simply swaps focus between two windows even if there are many windows stacked on top of each other. I assume this happens because focus behind grabs the window directly behind the current window and then places the current window directly behind the newly focused window.

Would it be possible to cycle through all stacked windows? Would this be as simple as moving the current window behind all others when a 'focus behind' command is issued?

It would be really great if it was possible to cycle through overlapping windows in either direction (like a cmd-tab vs. shift-cmd-tab).

Thanks for entertaining the idea!

in app1:
- window1 is at point a,b
- window2 is at point c,d
- window3 is at point e,f
- the windows have a focus order of [window2, window3, window1] which means that window2 is on top of window3 which is on top of window1

I do _not_ know the explicit z-index of the windows. Meaning if there are two different apps behind the current window I have not found a way to determine which app is above the other.

(I don't know how to use the markup at GitHub, but if you copy the entire text of the script, it should compile OK in AppleScript Editor, at least it did for me.)

Next time you run it, it lets you make a choice from whatever files exist in the Slate Sets folder and replaces the .slate file with the one you selected, then relaunches Slate to activate that one.

Even if you cancel changing config files, it makes sure Slate is running from the most recently loaded one.

So if you make changes or add any files to the Slate Sets folder, you can load the new ones quickly, no matter what  the file name is. One of the things it doesn't do yet is to provide the name of the last file you activated.

(The above assumes you're already using a .slate file. If you aren't, it performs the operation of creating one from default settings before it performs either of the actions described above, so you would need to run it 3 times to observe its full functionality.)

Thinking about it now it's obvious why: the German keyboard layouts (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), as well as others, are QWERTZ, not QWERTY. Could you add a “keyboardLayout” value for it? I'll be happy to provide further information or to test patches.

197,2013-01-13 06:13:38,"The problem is that when making a window that can be resized move to a corner, not setting the size set for the window doesn't yield optimal results. But when you apply that strategy to a window like System Preferences that can't be resized, the size formula probably wouldn't make it go to the right place if the destination corner is on the right side.  Rather than configuring separate sets of corner pushing shortcuts for resizeable and non-resizable windows, I used a sequence to try to apply the size constraints first, then push to the indicated corner. Top left needs only the formula, but the other 3 corners need the sequence. This assumes that displaying the whole window for windows that can't be resized takes priority over how much of the screen is occupied by the window. Here's an example

alias topleft corner top-left resize:screenSizeX/2;screenSizeY/2
alias topright move screenOriginX+screenSizeX/2;screenOriginY screenSizeX/2;screenSizeY/2

182,2012-12-05 15:34:18,"I learnt today that you can specify a style for `throw`... From `README.md`:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

It seems to me that `resize` with no parameter causes the window to be maximised in the new screen after the throw, whereas `resize` with parameters allows resizing, relative to the new screen's dimensions.

I suggest adding a `proportional` mode which resizes the window so that it occupies the same proportion of the new screen as it does of the old one.

So, suppose I have two screens; screen 0 is 500x1000 whereas screen 1 is 2000x3000.  And suppose I have a window on screen 0 whose width is 250 and height is 750 - so it is 50% of the width and 75% of the height of screen 0; when thrown to screen 1, it would resize to 1000x2250.

(IIRC this is, btw, SizeUp's default behaviour.)

I suppose another way to do this would be to allow it to be calculated in the config, and using `resize:x;y` style.  However, at present I don't think it's possible because the old screen's dimensions are unavailable?  (Would `windowSizeX` and `windowSizeY` refer to pre-throw window size correctly here?)

However, the use case I've described is perhaps obvious and common enough to warrant its own style?

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

but I wondered what you thought about lifting this restriction in some way.  So here are some thoughts.

Consider:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

To me, this seems an entirely reasonable thing to do, and in an ideal world, this would define `ch1` as a chain whose first invocation fired `seq1`, and whose second fired `seq2`:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

However, that seems not to happen at the moment; I presume that's because aliases are expanded as strings, so we end up with:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

and it's completely unclear/ill-defined which `chain` or `sequence` operations each `|` belongs to.  I don't even know what the actual parse tree is in this case.  Is it just going left-to-right?  If so, then I guess it's equivalent to:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

with a one-step chain?  (But this is just a guess, I haven't investigated what's _really_ happening.)

One simple way to get round this would be to just redefine how aliases work so that they're more like function calls than string expansions.  Then my approach above would work, I think. It would have a small performance overhead but I doubt it would be noticeable (?).

To really fix it means getting busy with the parser.  I haven't looked into your implementation, what you're doing with your AST, etc. but some thoughts...

An obvious first step is to introduce parentheses, allowing interpretations other than the default, e.g.:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

though I don't know how complicated this would be to implement or what knock-on effects it might have...

To Do It Properly I guess means defining precedence levels, in which case I guess `chain` is lower precedence (since its invocations are separated in time and triggered by humans, whereas `sequence`'s parts all happen one after the other).  Then 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

gets parsed as 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

by default.  Of course, you'd then probably still want to introduce parentheses so people can write:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

if they actually do want that!

Apologies if you've considered (and maybe disregarded) all this already. Slate an awesome piece of software as it is, and I realise this is probably a whole can of worms you've got better things to deal with. But I thought I'd flag it up in case you're interested...

177,2012-12-03 15:28:28,"I seem to have found an odd case where `move` doesn't properly resize the window.

I have two screens:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

(The larger screen is placed physically above the smaller, but I don't think that is relevant to the issue.)

The following keybinding is an attempt to define a ""maximise"" operation on Ctrl-Alt-Cmd-`m`:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

and this mainly works. However, if I maximise a window in the big screen (to 1920x1178, because of the menu bar), then throw it to the smaller one, two things happen:
1. The window's height is automatically constrained to the new screen's height (Chrome goes to 1046, for example - not sure why it's not 1050).
2. The window's width is _not_ constrained to 1680, and remains at 1920.

Now, that would be OK, if hitting Ctrl-Alt-Cmd-`m` again caused the window to maximise on its new screen. But it doesn't! It has no effect at all, it seems.  That strikes me as a bug.

I've got around this with the following kludge:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

i.e., precede the maximise operation with one which reduces the window's width to 50% of the screen's; this works, and I was happy with it. But for reasons I will elaborate on in another bug report, it's no longer so satisfying, so I thought I'd raise this issue separately, in case it's of interest (and to reduce confusion in the other report).
",gimbo,
177,2012-12-03 19:18:11,"yah I've noticed this too. OS X doesn't like resizing windows when either 1. the window is off the screen or 2. the resize causes the window to go off the screen. as a result the current move operation does something like this since you can't both move and resize the window at the same time:
1. resize the window
2. move the window
3. resize again in case the first resize fails

OR
1. move the window
2. resize the window
3. move the window again in case the resize was awkward

I have to think of a better way to do this. I think this should work:
1. resize the window to something tiny like 1,1
2. move the window assuming the size will be perfectly what is in the binding
3. resize the window (OS X may resize to something that is slightly off - explained below)
4. move the window again no longer assuming what the size will be

""The window's height is automatically constrained to the new screen's height (Chrome goes to 1046, for example - not sure why it's not 1050).""

There a couple reasons why this could be:
1. You have a hidden dock on the bottom of the screen. OS X is funny about how large it says the screen is. If there is a dock, it will cut off some pixels and say that your 1050 screen is actually more like 1046. Super irritating, I agree and technically I may be able to fix this but I think it may be more trouble than what it is worth.
2. The application itself refuses to be sized to 1050. This happens a lot with text editors and terminals. They don't liked to be sized such that a line is cut in half so they force the height/width to be a multiple of the font height/width.
",jigish,
177,2012-12-03 19:32:33,"_nods_ - hidden Dock in my case, and yes, have seen this with terminals, etc. too.  It's no problem really.

Sounds a bit hairy.  With my approach, you can perceive the two resizes, although I've made it seem smoother by resizing to 90% of screen width rather than 50% - though of course that's no general solution, I can just do it because I'm maximising in this case.  I wonder if, with your proposed approach, we'd notice the stages?
",gimbo,
177,2012-12-03 19:38:00,"you most definitely would. It would happen quick, but you'd _definitely_ see the stages. unfortunate, but currently the only way I can see to ensure proper moving/resizing.

though now that I think about it, I could _calculate_ whether the window is or will be off screen and adjust my approach accordingly. thought this seems like it would probably introduce a ton of corner cases and bugs. I feel like one single approach that works in all cases would probably be better.
",jigish,
177,2012-12-03 20:51:31,"ok weird. seems like I may have done some work to fix this before. can you paste the exact sequence of commands you do get in this state? in particular I'm interested in what your `throw` looks like. I've tried a number of different ways to break move and I cant seem to =/.
",jigish,
177,2012-12-04 18:34:38,"Sure thing.  Consider the following config:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

(Big screen is above little one - perhaps this is significant for why you can't reproduce?)

Then this sequence:
- Open a new window on big screen (Chrome, say).
- Maximise it.
- Throw down to smaller screen - window is now too wide (but the right height).
- Attempt to maximise.

fails at the fourth step: the window's width is _not_ reduced to `screenSizeX` for the new screen.

However, provided I reduce the width first, it works OK.  For example, if we have:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Then it works fine - and indeed this also works even if `fit-in-screen` is:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

but _not_ if it is:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

... so it looks like it's the reduction in width that really matters, for making it work...
",gimbo,

(As an aside, adding `resize` to the `throw`s as you requested gives the expected behaviour: upon a throw, the window is immediately resized to fill the new screen.)

Assuming you did mean to close this issue, I must sadly report that the problem remains for me.  If I understand correctly, you would expect that under 1.0.15, the following configuration:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

... would give the desired behaviour?  Alas, it doesn't.  Here's a detailed run through:

Initial status:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Then I throw it down to the smaller screen:

Then I hit Ctrl-alt-cmd-m again, but there's no change to the window's status.

After reducing its size, using a key bound to

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

and then maximising it with Ctrl-alt-cmd-m, it's maximised properly:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

then any window hanging off the bottom of screen 0 will not behave correctly with move operations that change its height.

174,2012-12-02 23:31:15,"So I got this to work sort of, but not as ideal or as generic as I'd like. 

`bind pad4:cmd,alt,ctrl,shift chain push left bar-resize:screenSizeX/2 | throw next resize:screenSizeX/2;screenSizeY`

There are two uses cases that are not currently covered with this command. 

### A user with more than two monitors.

Let's say a user has three monitors. On the third key press in the chain, there are no more commands so Slate loops back to the original command (which is simply to resize the window without moving to the next monitor). So essentially that third key press doesn't do anything since the window is already resized left from the previous throw next command. 

You have to press it again to move to the next command in the chain which actually throws to the next monitor. 

You could work around this by adding another command to the chain repeating the throw next command, but that requires updating the config file depending on how many monitors you have and still runs into the second use case issue...

### You change your mind and want the window on the original monitor.

As mentioned in the previous use case, when you loop the chain command, that first command doesn't do anything. 

So if you want to bring the window back to the original monitor after initiating the chain you have to press it four times (assuming you have just two monitors) instead of three. 
1. Resize left on first monitor. 
2. Resize left on second monitor. 
3. (chain repeats) and resizes left on current monitor (but window is already resized left). 
4. Resize left on first monitor. 

The question then is there a way to work around these two use cases? Primarily the second one?

172,2012-11-29 00:30:08,"When I first saw the description of modal keys, I was incorrectly envisioning something like the modal editing modes of vim. What I had hoped was that I could enter a modal state where Slate would then interpret all subsequent commands, until modal mode was exited, as belonging to the associated modal key.  For instance:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This would allow me to enter modal mode with `cmd+shift+t` and then use arrow keys repeatedly until I pressed `cmd+shift+t` again (or some alternate universal modal escape could be defined, like the `esc` key). I think the long modifier sequences that seem common in the configs I have observed are appropriate for one-off commands, but for repeated commands, such as might be expected with nudging and resizing, a modal mode where single keys can be used repeatedly would be very helpful.

You could just have the format be like:

bind tab:ctrl switch UIOPJKL

There might be a usability issue if you're chording the switcher, but I think it could be helpful. I tend to have a variety of windows open full screen. I could set a variety of toggles and layouts. I feel like it might be quicker to do this sometimes instead.

Also if the position of the hint could be controlled that'd be rad. Say offer the option of top/left/bottom/right and center.

Say refine it from what I said before to offer three options for position. For horizontal layouts offer it vertically: top, middle, bottom. For vertical have it be left, middle, right. I think this control would be great, as I've noticed a usability problem with the window hints where depending on the combination of icon and letter colors. Being able to position the hint location would help with that for me. Heck if you could position the title as well that'd be great. 

I for one wouldn't care about the forward back bindings being depreciated. They seem redundant to me with the the native cmd-tab switcher.  I'd bet some others would miss them though.

165,2012-12-13 09:41:57,"@jigish  Still didn't achieve what I wanted. After trying some options in `undoOps`, I found something weird happening. 
1. When `chain` is removed from `undoOps`, the following 'chained' command does not save snapshot at all:
   `bind f:ctrl;alt;cmd     chain move screenOriginX;screenOriginY screenSizeX;screenSizeY | undo`
2. However, normal `move` options do save snapshot:
   `bind f:shift;ctrl;alt;cmd     move screenOriginX;screenOriginY screenSizeX;screenSizeY`

Tried this with 'move only'(`undoOps move`) and 'everything except chain'(`undoOps activate-snapshot,grid,layout,move,resize,sequence,shell`).
Adding `chain` results in saving the snapshot, but fails to activate it -- perhaps due to what you said, as it saves another snapshot.

From the observation, my guess is that
_undoOps without chain_ makes it **fail early** when `chain` is seen, preventing the inner `move` save snapshots..? 
I've tested it by reading the `Application Support/com.slate.Slate/snapshots` file.

165,2012-12-14 00:31:18,"But what does _undoing a chain_ mean?

Since `chain` is combining multiple operations to one, I'm not sure whether letting the chain operation be undo'ed or not makes sense at all. It also conflicts with the phrase ""you can undo only movement-based operations"" because chain itself has nothing to do with movement.
You can't _undo the whole chained operations at one_ either, because it's circular.

How about removing chain from undoOps completely and
checking whether there are any other undoOps _inside_ the command?
",jangxyz,2012-11-28 00:25:30
165,2012-12-14 11:06:03,"I haven't been compeltely paying attention to this, or to how undo is implementing, but I just wanted to butt in with some general thoughts, which may or may not be helpful...

The usual way to handle undo is to build a stack of undo-able operations as they're performed, and then when you undo it simply pops operation items from the stack and applies their inverse (so you can only undo operations whose inverse you can compute (perhaps by explicitly storing prior state) and it's not in general possible to undo operations which have side effects, such as performing shell commands). I don't think chaining has any special effect here, because as you progress through a chain performing operations, it would just push commands onto the stack in the usual fashion? Or am I missing something?

`sequence` is a bit more interesting than `chain` because here we have multiple operations performed in aggregate; but that's OK, you just push onto the stack a special sequence container with each of the composite operations referenced from it, and if you undo/pop that operation, it just goes through the operations in the sequence in reverse, applying their inverses in the usual manner - with the usual caveats that certain operations have no well-defined inverse/undo.

I realise I might be talking about completely reimplementing how you do undo - but this is how I'd do it, anyway. :-)

I want to contribute a new keyboard layout, but I can't wrap my head around the logic of  `ASCIIToCode.plist` and `ASCIIToCode_Dvorak.plist`.

Could someone explain me what this files are about?

Adding a new layout would consist of adding a new .plist, then changing `Binding.m`'s method `asciiToCodeDict` do add the new layout. You'd also have to add a new keyboard layout string constant as well (e.g. `KEYBOARD_LAYOUT_DVORAK`).

Speaking of which, are you binding it to cmd+tab and have to seen any weird behavior? Specifically, sometimes when you activate switch it will think you're holding down the activate binding and forward the selected app all the way to the end of the list without you doing anything.

141,2012-10-30 08:34:59,"I just installed Slate earlier tonight and it has already earned its place in my login items. I thought there might be a way to map back to the ""send front window to back of current app's windows"" operation onto command-backtick (that is, cmd-`) like it was in older Mac OS X releases, but unfortunately have not been able to find any to do it. Can I make a feature request for this behavior?

**Rambling background for why I want this:**
_In older releases of Mac OS X, command-backtick was reserved for ""send frontmost window to back of current app's windows"". This made perfect sense as command-shift-backtick did the exact reverse, i.e. ""push backmost window of current app's windows to the front"" operation (and it in fact still does this operation)._

_Command-backtick changed in I think 10.5 or 10.6 to a strange hybrid that goes something like:_ 
- _make `n`th-from-front window into frontmost, incrementing `n` for subsequent operations..._
- _...but reset `n` if you click anywhere or if you switch applications;_
- _and if you're using Safari, also reset `n` if certain javascript/flash events fire in the frontmost window!_

_This has some annoying results for me. If you open three windows 1, 2, and 3; you can repeatedly perform the sequence ""command-backtick; click somewhere in the front window"" to alternate between windows 1 and 2 without ever bringing 3 to the front. There have been several new releases of OS X since this behavior changed to the current version that I dislike, so I have kinda given up hope of it being changed back._

It might be nice to be able to select which option to use from a key binding. For example, when resizing it would be nice to be able to select which anchor to use:

anchor = (optional) which corner to anchor on top-left|top-right|bottom-left|bottom-right (default is top-left)

by pressing e.g. ctrl+u (top-left), ctrl+o (top-right) etc.

and then being able to use the previously set resize commands. 

This avoids having to set new bindings for resizing from different anchors.

Similar ideas could be applied to other options.
",arlobryer,2012-11-17 20:33:03

I totally understand your point but I am wondering why simply creating two bindings doesn't solve the problem? Implementing the ability to bind multiple keys within a single bind directive is actually completely against my current architecture and could take a lot of effort to implement. If you can use multiple bindings to achieve the same effect I think it would be better to just use that then spend a bunch of time implementing another way of doing it.

Ah, didn't realise it contradicted the design so far. I guess I was imagining it would add flexibility by letting you 'multiply out' the commands as it were (say 4 option commands and 4 resize commands for a total of 16 resize possibilities). I think I was imagining that the chain operation could be adapted to this purpose. 
Assigning separate bindings totally works too though and is the solution I'm using at the moment.

As for my question… I saw the list of available keys and saw ""f"" before f1, f2, etc… so I was thinking that might stand for the function key ""fn"" but I can't get it to work as a modifier. If it currently does not work as a modifier are there plans to implement it, would be great especially on my laptop keyboard where so many of my modifier key combos + arrow keys are tied to other items.

Again, thank you for your time on this project, it is nothing but amazing for a 1.0 release and once I get the hang of configuring everything it will be an essential install on every machine of mine.

@jbleuzen I think you have the right idea. Thats the app I used to get my initial values. Unfortunately I don't have any non-US keyboards laying around so I can't really test it all out. It would be great if we could compile a list of keys everyone would like to see and I can add them in. For this I would need:
1. The character representation of the key. For example '3'. Note that the key should _not_ be created using modifiers. This means '3' is good, '#' is not.
2. The key code that the character represents on qwerty
3. The key code that the character represents on dvorak

If I can get this information I can start adding keys that people want one by one.

I've only tried this with Slate JavaScript configs.

If you're looking for a list of key codes, this isn't the worst place to start: https://github.com/tekezo/KeyRemap4MacBook/blob/version_8.3.0/src/bridge/generator/keycode/data/KeyCode.data (note that KR4MB uses hex and Slate decimal).

I'm on 1.0.10, I just upgraded this morning to verify its still doing this.

In my .slate, I have this:

`bind 5:f6 move screenSizeX/3;screenSizeY*7/9 screenSizeX/3;screenSizeY*2/9`

When I hit that key combination, the targeted window should move to 848,1080 with a size of 852,315.  Instead, it moved to: -4,0 with a size of 900,900.

If instead I change it to a chorded command, as so:

`bind 5:cmd move screenSizeX/3;screenSizeY*7/9 screenSizeX/3;screenSizeY*2/9`

It has the expected behavior.

",robacarp,2012-10-16 17:31:08
127,2012-10-09 20:24:22,"Smells like a bug to me. I'll take a look. As a side note in most cases you're going to want to add in `screenOriginX` and `screenOriginY` to the origin coordinates to make sure it is put onto the right screen.
",jigish,2012-10-16 17:31:08
127,2012-10-10 21:27:34,"Hmm. Ok I can't exactly repro what is happening but from what I can tell it definitely seems like it is because you are not using `screenOriginX` and `screenOriginY`. Here is what I think the bindings should look like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

`screenOriginX` and `screenOriginY` are the origin coordinates of the current screen. if you don't specify them it will just start at `0,0` which is the top-left of the monitor with your menu bar.
",jigish,2012-10-16 17:31:08
127,2012-10-11 17:02:54,"Welll... that didn't work.  Perhaps something is confused because I'm using dvorak?

I copied and pasted that command into my .slate, loaded config, and it sends windows to the top-left @ 900x900 still.

In my current case, I really only position windows on my primary monitor.  My second screen has a terminal on it, but it is always full screen.  Positioning from 0,0 is what I want, implicit or explicit.

The other commands work just fine with or without the origin specification.
",robacarp,2012-10-16 17:31:08
127,2012-10-11 17:08:17,"I've just stumbled onto another symptom.  I noticed that if I changed the command you provided above to begin with `bind  v:f6 move...` the window moves to a different spot and size, but still not the correct place.  This time it moves to bottom-right of primary screen and becomes ~640x315.

Then, and this is where the magic happened, I did f6 then 5 (which wasn't mapped to anything at all) and the window went back up to top left, 900x900.

Delete the v:f6 binding, reload config, window still goes to bottom right, 640x315.
Quit Sate, restart, v:f6 and 5:f6 mystery bindings go away.

I _think_ this is might be caused by the mappings not getting wiped on config reload (starting with a clean _slate,_ heh).

**Edit:** and now, since I expunged the corrupted map for 5:f6, the mapping as given in my .slate file works fine, with or without the screenOriginX/Y.  :-)

**Edit Again:** this is definitely a map corruption thing.  When rewriting the same chorded map, reloading slate does no good, but quitting and relaunching slate gives me a map with the revisions.

127,2012-10-11 18:38:57,"ok so I really need to document the fact that Load Config is unstable lol. It doesn't do a full reload, but is useful when slightly tweaking existing bindings.

Aside from that, let me see if I understand correctly:
1. You are using dvorak (I'm assuming you're also using the config to enable dvorak right?)
2. modal binding doesn't work but normal binding does
3. screenOriginX did _not_ fix the problem
4. two different modal bindings with the same operation do different things

Does that sum it up?

Given your comment that Load Config isn't considered stable code, then I wouldn't worry about it.
1. I am using dvorak, and it is configured as such in .slate
2. I only have modal bindings mapped, and they work fine when I quit + reopen slate.  As far as regular mappings, I have no test background.
3. changing the mappings to include screenOriginX did not alter the behavior whatsoever.  All of my window placements happen on the primary screen.
4. the only time I observed two modal bindings doing anything similar was when slate needed to be restarted.

For me something like this results in looping between option-1 and 2 for the remaining windows
layout laptop 'Finder':MAIN_FIRST:REPEAT  ${option-1} | ${option-2} 

as a workaround I made unique options for the first 10 windows, it works but it is not very elegant
layout laptop 'Finder':MAIN_FIRST                          ${top-right} | ${option-1} | ${option-2} | ${option-3} | ...

My setup is like this: two emacs windows on the left, side by side, and every other windows on the right, of the same size (only the frontmost being visible).

I just tried it out and it works as expected with a `bind` operation. But I cant get it to work in a `layout` operation. I define a layout and bind it to a keystroke. It just resizes the application but doesn't focus it.

1. use a `sequence` for a one-off case where you want to just focus one app on one layout.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
1. use `layoutFocusOnActivate` if you always want to focus things after any layout activates

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

When I do a cmd alt up or cmd alt down, I sometimes get a different behavior. Here is one I found reproducible.

I have two emacs windows on the left hand side of the screen, with the exact same size (620x873), stacked one over the other. I also have a Firefox window almost maximized to the whole screen (1436 x 878). If I put the emacs windows forward (by cmd-tab), doing ""cmd-alt-up"" switches between the two windows, as expected. However, if I do ""cmd-alt-down"" I switch to the Firefox window. Then it's not possible to get back to the emacs windows by any combination of ""cmd-alt-arrow"". This seems a bug for two reasons:
- it's not consistent with the other key binding, which is bound to the same thing
- there is an emacs window behind, so it should be preferred.

I have also found some other strange behavior:
- switch from Emacs to Firefox (cmd-tab), then
  - cmd-alt-up brings back the emacs window (so switching with cmd-tab is different than switching focus)
  - cmd-alt-down brings the emacs window forward then immediately sends it back, leaving the Firefox window with the focus. This can only be done once after a cmd-tab.

USE CASE: A `throw` operation that both resizes _and_ repositions the window.

EXAMPLE: with the proposed `sequence` operation:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I could imagine useful scenarios involving adding a `nudge` a `focus` or even a `hint` to a sequence, too (e.g. throw the current window to another screen and then focus a window that had been obscured by the moved window in preparation for the next operation).

An `IGNORE_FAIL` option would probably be appropriate for this, as well.

The issue with doing this with something like `hint` is that `hint` breaks the current event loop while waiting for the input so you'd have to restrict `hint` to being the last operation.

Nor do I have any documentation in the code (though I have a couple issues for myself to add documentation and unit tests - #97 and #98).

As far as building goes -- You need to get the latest Xcode. Slate uses ARC which is why you're getting all the undeclared identifier __bridge all over the place. Thats an ARC specific directive that tells the compiler that the code I am referencing is non-ARC. Once you get the latest Xcode, the target ""Slate"" should build it. I also have a ruby script that can generate the .tar.gz and the .dmg in script/slate.rb. Basically run `script/slate.rb gen` and it will generate everything and throw it into the build/Release folder. There are some dependancies though (one of which is a git submodule) so you may need to look through the script and make sure you have it all.

Sorry I can't be of more help. I'm trying to get things documented but slate has grown to a size that it is a pretty large task now lol.

Anyway, it turns out that in order to get the latest xcode, I need to upgrade from Snow Leopard. I'm not convinced that I want to do that right now, so I'll have to temporarily retract my enthusiasm for implementing this feature myself. I'll have to revisit the idea after I figure out whether I want to upgrade to Mountain Lion. Thanks again for all the good work!

103,2012-10-03 18:03:51,"@mohanzhang Xcode 4.2 is/was available for Snow Leopard. Apple was so _nice_ to remove it from their servers but you can find it on [TPB](http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6721955/). I realize that not everyone is a friend of torrents but in this case Apple is not even helping developers on old OS X versions anymore.

103,2012-10-03 21:40:08,"Thanks @paddykontschak - For the record, I neither deny nor acknowledge the existence of this torrent.

@jigish But suppose hypothetically that I got Xcode 4.2 via some means and then tried to build the project again. I'd, uh, _probably_ get errors like the following:

.../slate/Slate/SlateAppDelegate.m:36:13: error: existing ivar 'currentHintOperation' for unsafe_unretained property 'currentHintOperation' must be __unsafe_unretained [4]

Any idea what that means? Is there some setting I'm missing somewhere?
",mohanzhang,2012-10-07 00:04:18
103,2012-10-03 21:49:17,"hmm. thats a good question. I'm using Xcode 4.5 so i'm not getting that error. From what I can tell it would be complaining about how the properties are declared for some reason. Probably adding something like `(strong)` after `@property` would fix it. This would be a problem most likely fixed by Apple's compiler upgrades since 4.2.
",jigish,2012-10-07 00:04:18
103,2012-10-03 23:19:31,"I think you're right. Adding (strong) made the error go away. I read briefly about the issue and it does seem that there was a change in ARC in later versions of Xcode. Xcode 4.2 starts out with 7 errors initially, but as files compile successfully after being fixed in the above way, those lower in the dependency chain that were previously not touched then start giving similar errors, creating a cascade of errors that will take forever (or ""too long for me"" :p) to fix.

Well ok, I guess it's back to the Snow Leopard vs Mountain Lion internal debate. Not to turn this into a os-war tangent, but it does kind of suck that with Apple's recent directions, there is no longer a clear choice for best OS anymore :(

In the off-chance I decide to go for the upgrade, here's the basic design I considered:
- Add a new config called ""focusOnLayoutOperation"" that can be true or false
- Inside activateLayout in LayoutOperation.m, check for the config value and if true, iterate windowsArrRef and bring each one into focus

Of course, I have no clue if there are any details that disqualify this design since I haven't looked too closely, but would you say something like that is reasonable?
",mohanzhang,2012-10-07 00:04:18
103,2012-10-06 22:04:27,"So actually I thought it would be kind of elegant to use the ordering of the directives in the .slate file to be the order in which the windows are focused. So the last one specified would be the last focused and therefore the one that is focused at the end of the layout operation. This way we have consistent behavior regardless of what order the windows are in windowsArrRef. I actually may get around to this today so you may not have to worry about Snow Leopard vs Mountain Lion until later in the future :)
",jigish,2012-10-07 00:04:18
103,2012-10-07 00:04:18,"This is done. Will be in version 1.0.7 when I push it. The config is called `layoutFocusOnActivate`. I like the first word in the config name to be the operation it touches so it is a bit easier to figure out what they do.

Basically, if set to true, it will focus all windows that the layout operation touches in the order that it touches them. The order will be the order in which the applications are configured in the .slate file.

I read a good portion of the readme, cmd-f'd around for a few keywords in there too, and read the titles of all the open and closed issues and didn't find anything like this. Hopefully I'm not just creating spam here.

Keyboard chording is something I try and do as little of as possible to keep my RSI at bay.  As such, I had my Divvy setup configured with only application-wide shortcuts, and F6 launched the Divvy window.  The paradigm became: F6 then 0, to quickly shove my browser window up to the top-right corner, or F6 then 1 to take up the whole screen, or F6 then 6 to give me a centered window, etc.  All of the commands were single keystroke arrangements, but prefixed by the mode-trigger F6.

A benefit of this is that I was able to map out many many window sizes and placements without really impacting the global key command space.  The entire number row and the entire top row of the keyboard are all mapped to a few different things.   The mapping would simplify greatly using your layouts and snapshots feature, but my personal preference would still be to have a modal interface rather than a chorded.  (cough _vimuser_ :-)

I'm pretty sure I'm an outlier here, and that it might just be a major rework of your code to support a feature like this, but I thought I'd drop it in the suggestion box anyway...for a rainy day.

Thanks again for a well done window manager!

1. if we're going to embed ruby/python/lua I'd like to do it right. e.g. you should be able to run the if/else _while_ the binding is activated. So you could use the current values of the window/screen/etc to change what you want to do with the particular binding in real-time. Like what @v-yarotsky commented.
2. I do _not_ want to shell out to achieve this. that would have horrible performance. As such I need a language with an interpreter that I can bind directly into objective-c. For example: what @mgax has done in his python branch.

I'm going to try to look into this today/tomorrow most likely and hopefully come out with a decision on the language to use going forward. Right now Python/Lua seem like the easiest to embed. Though I personally prefer Ruby so if I can find a good way to embed it I'll probably try that.

Also, if I do this, I'm going to try to revamp the documentation/wiki as part of the process since most of the syntax will change as a result.

From within Python code, you have access to the Objective-C runtime, so you can call into Slate's classes. Here's how to use it: https://gist.github.com/4162837.

The `currentWindow` object encapsulates operations on the focused window and the `slate` object allows the script to do things like query all the windows and show window hints.

1. Is the DSL for configuration different from the programmability language?  If so, I should think it would need a huge justification.  The complexity of supporting two languages (both implementation and FAQ) seems to outweigh the idea of two.
2. Assuming there is one language, do we invent one of our own? IT doesn't matter if it's a subset of another known language, it'll just be different. Again, unless someone has a huge justification for this, we should go with something well-known in its entirety.
3. Assuming that we will be using something well-known, what baggage will the language implementation bring in? From the time a keystroke is received to when the effects of the event handler are fully visible, it has to be fast. You can't page in megabytes.  You can't run a garbage collector multiple times. Are there other programming-model impediments that we would bring in?

MacRuby is LLVM compiled to some extent and uses Objective-C classes directly so there is little to no lag translating the objects.

The server idea is interesting and has some significant advantages, I definitely agree that it would have to be forked into some separate Daemon or something though. It is an interesting idea for a project, maybe a fork of Slate, a socket interface for the mac accessibility API or something. However, that is something to discuss maybe in another issue/fork.

The advantage of a language embedded right in is it allows a DSL so users can configure Slate in a familiar language, it would also make adding new commands slightly easier because no parsing code would be required. However, it also allows for advanced users to code more complex behaviours.

In addition to `~/.slate`, you can create `~/.slate.js`, which gets executed in a WebScripting context. There is a `slate` global object with a few methods:
- `log(message)` - print a message using NSLog.
- `bind(keystroke, callback, repeat)` - register a binding that will invoke the given JavaScript function.
- `resize(x, y)`, `nudge(x, y)`, `focus(x, y)` - perform these operations.
- `relaunch()` - restart Slate to reload configuration.

This is what a configuration file might look like: https://gist.github.com/4569350.

The next step is to implement missing operations, and to simplify the syntax, so you can write:

1) key sequences

is it also possible to add key sequences?

like: 

['k:cmd,alt' , 'a', 'x']
['k:cmd,alt' , '1']

2) slate Shortcut Prefix

let me somehow define a general intro shortcut to activate slate, so all my slate commands overwrite the shortcuts of other apps.

3) key definitions

because i dont like strings as definitions, can we somehow get rid of the 'l:cmd,ctrl,alt' as string syntax? i like it more as constants or objects? or is this too much overconfigurated?

somehow like this:
Key.a.cmd.ctrl.alt
Key('a').cmd.ctrl.alt
key.enter.cmd

4) access to all child windows?

use case: i have a firefox open with many (child) windows - now i like to set the size not only for the current active child window, but for all childwindows of firefox?

additional: for all apps(+child windows) on current screen 
additional: on all screens

is this with the dsl then posssible?

1) Can I have an example of how this would be used? Are you saying that a sequence of keys would trigger a binding?
2) you mean Modal Bindings?
3) I think this is a bit overdone. What would make sense is to wrap the entire keystroke in a class which would make it easier to support modal bindings.
4) yah this is what I would want to do. the `slate` object would have the information about the current window and maybe with an option on the method we could add the information about all windows on the screen. I say an option on the method because it would affect performance.

because some shortcuts overwrite my app shortcuts i would like to have a sequence to activate it

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

i would hide all shortcuts behind a starting shorcut `'s:cmd,alt'`

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

91,2013-01-20 08:15:17,"@jigish Go ahead and merge it, that was the point :) I was also thinking about pulling in Underscore.

Instantiating an Operation for every callback is not ideal, but we can worry about performance later, once we figure out what's possible with scripting, and where it's going.

I actually prefer string key definitions, they are shorter and more expressive, reminiscent of CSS selectors. The whole binding syntax is inspired by Backbone [event delegation](http://backbonejs.org/#View-delegateEvents) for views.

What sort of extra bindings do you have in mind? Here's one possible approach: Keep a simple API for JavaScript, basically a thin wrapper around `RegisterEventHotKey` and `activateBinding:isRepeat:`, and implement more complex constructs in JavaScript, where it's easier to experiment.
",mgax,2013-01-24 00:31:55
91,2013-01-20 13:50:50,"I think a cool way to do modal/flexible bindings would be to have an api function in JS that allows you to remove bindings. That way you could implement your own modal bindings as well as other things like pressing things in quick succession.

91,2013-01-20 16:02:43,"@trishume Yes, that's precisely the idea, but the Slate bindings implementation doesn't make it easy. I have an idea how to make it work though. Also you need a working `setTimeout` implementation, but that should be no problem.

91,2013-01-21 02:35:23,"I've been experimenting in my [javascript-kvc branch](https://github.com/mgax/slate/tree/javascript-kvc) with a JS-friendly way to access application and window information, based on [KVC](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueCoding/Articles/KeyValueCoding.html) (key-value coding), as suggested by Apple's documentation on [WebScripting](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/WebKit/Protocols/WebScripting_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/cat/WebScripting). For example:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The `pack` and `unpack` methods are necessary because `NSDictionary` is not automatically converted to a JS object. [Here](http://grep.ro/quickpub/slate/2013-01-21/) is a build of the `javascript-kvc` branch.

91,2013-01-21 02:40:40,"Interesting. I've been refactoring all the operations and such to make it easier to access through JS myself. Focusing more on the operations themselves and less on free-form function bindings. Was planning on doing something like this next but glad you got to it :). Once I finish implementing all the operations, I'll check this stuff out and see if I can do a clean merge.
",jigish,2013-01-24 00:31:55
91,2013-01-21 02:44:37,"btw, a little taste of what I've done:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Sort of changed around the syntax and such to make it easier to add new operations. Each operation can be created using the string name then an options hash. The hash can contain functions which will be evaluated at run time or constants which will be stored into the operation at config time. `slate.operation` will instantiate an operation and calling `run` on the returned object will run the operation. This way we don't waste time recreating operations over and over.
",jigish,2013-01-24 00:31:55
91,2013-01-21 07:10:37,"ok just pushed my changes. theres a ton of stuff there. here is what is left to make this fully functional (so you only need the `.slate.js`):
- include @mgax's stuff to expose current window info, screen info, and other things
- add the other directives (`config`, `layout`, `default`, `source`)
- verify/add support for modal keys and implement modal toggle

some additional ideas/notes:
- `config` locally. i.e. setting a config for a particular binding and not for others
- `loop` operation. only available from js. will execute the given operation or function for every window (you'll be able to get the current window info from the function). should probably add an option to only loop through windows in the current app.
- `layout` should really be easier in js than it currently is in the default syntax. I'll try to clean it up when I implement it in js. Ideally, you should be able to call non-movement operations from within the layout (for example `hide`) without jumping through hoops and the various options should be easier to specify.
- `source` should be able to source both normal `.slate` files and `.slate.js` files.

I'm going to start with `config` since it should be really simple.

I need to figure out a way to detect the syntax errors. I haven't really spent much time on it though. If apple doesn't have any APIs to detect it one idea is to try to run  a very simple function like `function() { return true; }` after importing the user's JS.

91,2013-08-07 21:44:17,"@mgax, @mgax, @jigish, @trishume, @wez:

I just looked at the scripting-language discussion above, and I have some information that may help.

Recently I wrote my own window manager called AppGrid that was along the lines of Spectacle.app but with slightly different actions. Then I wanted to see if I can add scripting to it, so I copied Slate's approach of embedding JS. (However I used JSCocoa which wraps JavaScriptCore directly rather than going through a WebView.) And I renamed the app to [Zephyros](https://github.com/sdegutis/zephyros).

This worked fine, but I wanted to try adding Ruby too. I looked into MacRuby, and as noted above, realized that it only works in GC-enabled apps, and my app used ARC. And RubyCocoa was deprecated. So I just compiled Ruby 2.0 and embedded it directly. It was easy enough to do, took just one weekend.

But then I wanted to embed Python. And Lua. And F-Script, and Nu. But I realized this wouldn't scale, because the executable was getting really big. And I wanted to script it in Go and Rust and Elixir, but you can't embed these into an ObjC app. So I concluded that embedding was the wrong approach if my goal was to extend it via more than one language.

So I came up with what I think is a good compromise. The app acts like a server, listening on a local unix socket, and scripts are written as clients that connect and send messages and receive responses. The protocol is a simple JSON protocol that mimics ObjC method calls, so you would send Zephyros `[message_id_1, my_window_id, ""title""]` and it would send back `[message_id_1, ""Terminal.app - bash""]` for example. Here's some [more details about it](https://github.com/sdegutis/zephyros/blob/master/Docs/TCP.md).

The performance doesn't suffer from this approach. Even on my slower Mac, it performs just as good as it did when it was embedded. The overhead of using unix sockets and parsing JSON doesn't seem to be much higher than the overhead of translating JS <-> ObjC using a WebView. But admittedly you'd have two processes running instead of just one. However that may be a pro rather than a con, depending on how you look at it.

What do you think of taking this approach in Slate.app? It might involve a little internal refactoring, but I think allowing Slate to be scripted in many languages would be really cool.

Also, this message is just a warning. You _can_ click continue and it will automatically load the default slate file so you can try it out. It'll just get irritating because every startup will show this message.

One thing is keeping it from being perfect for me, though. My use case is that when I connect or disconnect an external monitor, I want to re-layout windows that are on multiple spaces.

My current stab at a config file:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

(I've just bound this to a keyboard shortcut for testing, I've not set up the defaults yet)

Chrome is on Desktop 1, and Sublime is on Desktop 2. If I hit ctrl+r while on Desktop 1, it correctly repositions Chrome, but doesn't touch Sublime. If I'm on Desktop 2, Sublime works but Chrome doesn't.

I won't give up on this feature as I would really love it myself, but unfortunately I was thinking I'd try to throw together some applescript to do this as programmatically it doesn't seem possible with Apple's current APIs and according to the Hyperspaces dev team this is no longer possible.

As of right now:

OS X 10.5 and 10.6 can technically support this through applescript.
OS X 10.7+ does not support this in any way.

As such, I don't feel comfortable implementing a feature that is only usable by the older version of OS X so yah, I'll be shelving this idea until I come across a solution (if ever i do) =/.

Another app I use, TotalSpaces also can move windows between spaces so there must be a way.

A temporary solution could be to trigger a specific layout when the current space changes. I found an old and probably no longer useful post on that http://tonyarnold.com/post/2023/detecting-when-the-active-space-changes/. Along with this, the above space IDs could be used to limit which windows are changed depending on which space the user is on. Then you could configure an app such as Finder to be in one position and size on one space but another position or size on a different space.

I'd also like to put in my +1 on this feature. A friend of mine has been using Awesome WM on his ArchLinux box and tempting me to try and find something similar for OS X and your app is the closest I've found. The apps I've tried all suck because it takes too much time to configure where the apps are. Then if your screen changes resolution, the positions are all messed up and you have to redo all that work.

Please, don't. If you can't get slate working with the default OS X

Amazing work on Slate. I am late to the party but it is a pretty awesome tool so far.

The application ""Stay"" http://cordlessdog.com/stay/ does some of these things while working with Spaces. I set it up to see if it could handle saving window layouts that are activated by a change of Monitor connection. It did a pretty good job, and did work with Spaces. but unfortunately it was too buggy to deserve a 15$ buy.

My use case is a laptop which is connected and disconnected from a desk monitor of a different resolution many times throughout my work day and I come in and out of meetings. I set up Stay to optimize the location and placement of a handful of always open applications in their respective Space for each monitor's resolution. In addition to Slate's other handy features, I am hoping to use it to mimic the same function.  (I use TotalSpaces as an enhancement to the native Maverick's Spaces) 

Thanks for the great work on Slate. I look forward to see it evolve.

I've just discovered Slate and love it, but can't stand moving my windows around spaces manually!

I defined the following actions in `.slate.js`:

Caveats:
- The window click coordinates and delays are found by trial and error, you may need to adjust them.
- The tool only allows for sending a limited range of keystrokes, so moving window to desktop N isn't possible with it.

I am just like you -- over the years I have gotten used to having certain ""window management keyboard shortcuts"" and, each time I upgrade OSX essentially, they have screwed around with it and broken my existing solutions.  Literally every time I have upgraded, I've had to rejigger my setup.

Yesterday I upgraded from Mavericks -> El Capitan ... this broke ""TotalSpaces 2"" ... which I was using for spaces management, and for moving windows from one space to another with a keyboard shortcut.  I'm ok with El Capitan's new Spaces feature (although it is not as good as TotalSpaces) ... but amazingly in El Capitan there's no keyboard shortcut to move a window to a new space.

I dug and dug, and I discovered that in ""SizeUp"" (which I have used in the past and still have a license to), the keyboard shortcuts to move windows between spaces, are working.  

So -- really this doesn't have anything to do with Slate, but in my research to try and figure out how I can accomplish this _at all_ on El Capitan, I ended up here ... and so I am just leaving this here, to help folks upgrading to El Capitan in the future: try SizeUp.

67,2012-04-25 11:33:48,"I'm currently using Slate only for the directional focussing, which is an awesome feature! But I can't seem to get it to work consistently, and I'm not sure if this is a bug in Slate or a misunderstanding of this feature on my part.

I have the following configuration:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I'm not quite sure how to explain the behaviour... basically focussing only works _sometimes_. I think the problem is mainly when trying to focus to a window from a _different_ application than the current one. For example, if I have a Firefox window and an iTerm window, I'm sometimes able to switch from one to the other, but not back to the previous window. It doesn't seem to make a difference if the windows are overlapping or not.

Is there maybe some kind of debug output I can enable to see what Slate is doing?

By the way, I added the `focusCheckWidthMax` setting to be able to switch between non-overlapping windows, and I also tried setting `focusPreferSameApp` to `false`, but this only seemed to make it worse (e.g. I wasn't able to switch between two overlapping Firefox windows anymore).
",toupeira,
67,2012-05-01 18:41:12,"The best way to see debug output is to actually run the project from within Xcode. Other than that I can explain how the focusing is implemented and you can tell me if it is doing something wrong based on that :) --

Lets say you're trying to focus a window to the right of the current window. Slate will create a rectangle starting from the top-right point of the window with 1 pixel width and ending at the bottom-right point of the window. Slate will check to see if any open window is within that rectangle. If so, it will focus that window (if focusPreferSameApp and there are multiple windows, it will focus a window within the same app). If no window is found, it will increase the width of the rectangle iteratively until it hits focusCheckWidthMax.

As such, focus only really works if you've tiled your windows and don't have windows that overlap much. I'm working on some changes to the way I track windows that should make focus more useful in the non-tiled case, but those changes are a ways off.

If you have a screenshot of your window configuration when the problem occurs please send it to me and I'll take a look.

The scenario in which I have noticed this is when I have multiple windows open on both the left and right hand sides of my screen arranged using 'push left/right  bar-resize:screenSizeX/2' To jump from side to side I use 'focus left/right' It is not clear how slate decides which window on a given side to focus, but it does consistently choose the same window.

 For example, if I have windows A and B on the left, and B and C on the right, 'focus left' will always select B and 'focus right' will always select C, even if A or D happened to be on top. I think the preferred behavior would for directional focus would be to select the topmost window when multiple windows are found.

67,2013-01-24 20:24:50,"interesting. I thought it does focus the topmost. I'll take a look at the code to refresh my memory. If it doesn't I'm pretty sure thats a bug.
",jigish,

I originally noticed the problem with iTerm2. After playing around with Firefox, Safari, Finder, and iTerm2 for a few minutes it seems that it is only a problem with iTerm2. With the other applications it seems to always focus on the topmost.

I'm noticing that iTerm2 doesn't resize perfectly to half the screen  if I 'push left/right bar-resize:screenSizeX/2' (is it fitting to the nearest full row and column of text?). Could that cause problems with directional focus?

i've worked around that by rolling my own JavaScript directional focus functions that use slate.windowUnderPoint(), which works more predictably. for example, here's my code to focus right (with focusCheckWidth and focusCheckWidthMax hard coded to 10):

52,2012-03-26 18:00:53,"This may require some research & asking around (Dmac may have an opinion about this) to validate whether centered is actually better than in the upper left.

Anecdotally, when I'm looking at windows and quickly switching between them, my eyes are focused in the center of the window, waiting for the hint character to show, not the upper left corner. For me it's a slight annoyance to have to look at the upper left corner of the window, wait for the character, type it, and then focus back again on the center of the window.
",philc,2012-03-27 22:33:14
52,2012-03-26 18:15:28,"One way to do this might be to expose `windowSize{X,Y}` when setting `windowHintsTopLeft{X,Y}`, to make it configurable. Then to center it I could just say

52,2012-03-26 22:07:49,"Hmm, so theoretically you should be able to do that already. I'm pretty sure I tested that. In the ""Expressions"" section of the readme anything that is not explicitly stated to not be allowed in a certain location is allowed everywhere. The only problem is I currently test a point near the top left for visibility regardless of where the hint is configured to be placed. I would need to change the hint operation to test the center of the hint for visibility instead. In relation to issue #50, I could just have it default to the ""smart"" option and the configurations would override that to change it to be a fixed position.
",jigish,2012-03-27 22:33:14

51,2012-03-26 17:56:53,"On my screen, I have 3 windows from left to right, with the first one focused. The hints are A B C.

If I focus the second window, the hints are B A C. The hint letters change depending on which window is focused. I think it will be less disturbing if the hints had a stable ordering from left to right across the screen (i.e. the leftmost window is always A).
",philc,2012-03-28 00:04:34
51,2012-03-26 22:01:31,"This is because the order in which I get windows from the API. As a result of the switch operation I may add a constantly updating global list of windows sorted by which window was activated the last. In this case, I should be able to attach a hint letter to every window and keep it the same throughout its lifetime. This would also allow me to save time calculating which hint should be attached to which window which may make the hint operation faster.
",jigish,2012-03-28 00:04:34
51,2012-03-26 23:50:16,"IMO, sorting that list by the window's X and Y would be more usable than giving each window a consistent hint, because particular windows churn all the time, but ""the left half of my screen"" stays constant.
",philc,2012-03-28 00:04:34
51,2012-03-27 23:15:35,"I can agree with that, but the problem I see is even though the ""left half of my screen"" remains constant the number of windows will always be changing. Thus if I choose to anchor the ""beginning"" of the window list to the left side of the screen, the hint for the rightmost window will be constantly changing while the hint for the leftmost window will be constant. That seems sort of silly. If I keep the hint tied to the specific window over its lifetime it may be a bit more intuitive, as at least for me I think of the content of each window rather than its location when I want to switch to it. So if I tie, for example, the terminal running my rails to ""b"" and I think to myself ""I need to focus my rails terminal"" it seems a bit more natural to just be able to hit ""b"" again to get to it if I've already done that once.

For now, though, keeping track of windows over their lifetime is part of the switch operation's task which will take a bit more time. So I'll implement the left-to-right ordering as a config as I still feel it would get a bit counterintuitive at times.
",jigish,2012-03-28 00:04:34
51,2012-03-27 23:19:06,"also as a side note, the more windows that are open, the more overhead the left-to-right version will add as I'll have to sort the windows based on x and y coords before I can hint them. hopefully it won't reduce performance too much.

50,2012-03-26 17:53:51,"This will allow you to show hints for more windows. Today, if the bulk of a window is showing but something is obscuring the upper left corner of the window, you can't select it with window hints.

The caveats to doing this are
1. You may need to visibility test two points in a window instead of just one, which may slow down how quickly you can show hints if that visibility test is expensive.
2. The placement of the hints will not always be in the same place on the window -- sometimes it's the upper left, sometimes its centered.
",philc,2012-03-27 23:03:25
50,2012-03-27 23:03:25,"I have implemented this in the following manner:

windowHintsTopLeftX and windowHintsTopLeftY are now arrays of expressions. Their sizes should be equal and non-zero (or all hint operations will fail validation during startup). The hint operation will first check the locations in the arrays sequentially until it finds a valid one, then display the hint there. if all the locations are invalid, it will not display a hint for that window. the new default values are:

config windowHintsTopLeftX (windowSizeX/2)-(windowHintsWidth/2);0
config windowHintsTopLeftY (windowSizeY/2)-(windowHintsHeight/2);0

which means that hint operations will first try to show the hint in the center of the window, and if the center is covered, try the top-left of the window.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

If you provide a nice UI out of the box, none of these will be needed.  Having customizable behavior is nice, but having customizable appearance limits what you can do in the future. If you wanted to add a nice visual effect upon selection (e.g. animating the text color from white->yellow), you can't, because you don't control the appearance.

In particular, letting users specify the hint positioning prevents you from doing smart hint placement in the future. A really nice feature would be to show a hint in the upper left corner _or_ the center of the app, depending on which is visible. This happens to me all the time now -- I'll have a terminal which obscures the left side of some window, and I can't select those underlying windows using window hints, because their upper left corner is hidden (but the rest of the window is visible).

It's up to you, but I'd rather you take control of the aesthetic instead of letting the user mess with it so that you can provide a nice one and keep your software and README simpler.

After doing this adjustment via Preferences, the Slate screen numbering does not update -- screen 1 could now be on the right, while screen 3 is on the left, for instance.

screenOriginY seems to know about the menubar, its value is 22px.

Here is how it works:

Default (no work on your part): screens are ordered from left to right (by the top-left origin X coordinate, falling back on Y coordinate if they are the same). This means they are _not_ ordered as I listed in my above comment.

If you want to use the old style ordering, you can set the config ""orderScreensLeftToRight"" to false.
