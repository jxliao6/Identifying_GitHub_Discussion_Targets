81,2015-10-29 06:00:24,"@minimaxir Note that when the list changes, cd to naughtystrings and run ""go generate"", then commit the changes to the generated file in naughtystrings/internal. (Must have go installed to use ""go generate"" unfortunately; hopefully that won't be much of a burden. Or I guess Go users can periodically run it for you and send a PR; in that case, it would be good to add a note in the README about it.

81,2015-10-29 07:46:28,"@minimaxir I should also add that the generate command at the top of naughtystrings/naughtystrings.go is this: `go-bindata -ignore \.git\S* -ignore LICENSE -ignore README\.md -ignore blns\.base64\.txt -ignore blns\.txt -ignore package\.json -o internal/resource.go -nocompress -pkg internal ..`. Note that the command has to explicitly list all the files you _don't_ want added as a resource to the binary from the big-list-of-naughty-strings directory. If you add any new files to the big-list-of-naughty-strings directory (that's the `..` part), you'll have to exclude them in that command too. It's very unfortunate, but the `go-bindata` command only supports exclusion right now. Hopefully I or someone else can add inclusion flags to it some time so the generate command doesn't have to be as brittle as this.

@minimaxir It's quite easy:

59,2015-08-20 07:26:21,"@stuartpb I though it over, but I'd rather have the 502 which has greater impact because:
- Google `cirosantilli` leads directly to my website page which contains all my projects
- the front page is notoriously useless, with only 5 projects

46,2015-08-19 19:37:07,"@stuartpb To quote the link you just cited (emphasis mine):

> **The Unicode Standard permits the BOM in UTF-8**,[2] but does not require or recommend its use.[3] Byte order has no meaning in UTF-8,[4] so its only use in UTF-8 is to signal at the start that the text stream is encoded in UTF-8. **The BOM may also appear when UTF-8 data is converted from other encodings that use a BOM. The standard also does not recommend removing a BOM when it is there**, so that round-tripping between encodings does not lose information, and so that code that relies on it continues to work.[5][6]

46,2015-08-19 20:16:46,"@stuartpb However, that does not apply to many web applications because they accept ""plaintext"" generated by Microsoft applications or Google Docs.

> Even so, Microsoft compilers[9] and interpreters, and many pieces of software on Microsoft Windows such as Notepad will not correctly read UTF-8 text unless it has only ASCII characters or it starts with the BOM, and will add a BOM to the start when saving text as UTF-8. Google Docs will add a BOM when a Microsoft Word document is downloaded as a plain text file.
",ssokolow,stuartpb
46,2015-08-19 20:35:15,"@stuartpb My point was that, ""The presence of a BOM anywhere in UTF-8 is a bug."" sounded like you might have been misinterpreting the way this case should be tested and, when you clarified, it still felt like you might have been misinterpreting... just in how the standard applied to the applications in question rather than what the standard said... something I no longer think.
