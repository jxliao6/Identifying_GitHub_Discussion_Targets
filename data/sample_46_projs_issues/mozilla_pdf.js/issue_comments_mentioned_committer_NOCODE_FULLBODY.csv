8192,2017-03-24 15:12:52,"@yurydelendik For me this is analogous to the situation where a couple of Web APIs had to change their names because MooTools was applying partial polyfills and code on the Web started depending on it.

Polyfilling is risky, IMO it should be done only with complete polyfills and only in final apps, not in libraries. If libraries need a particular API that's not available everywhere, they should wrap the native API in an utility function and use that function; that removes the whole class of possible bugs like this one.

In short: library code shouldn't modify objects it doesn't own, e.g. native browser globals.",mgol,yurydelendik
8192,2017-03-24 15:18:25,"> Polyfilling is risky

@mgol oh, I agree. Entire PDF.js viewer application must reside in its own sandbox (I recommend iframe), but people keep using it within bigger apps. So we have to react accordingly.",yurydelendik,mgol

Based on this, a naive solution could perhaps be to use `Util.normalizeRect` at https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/d0d9843a0e62b8abdfcd293f7e6acce0b9ce7f6d/src/display/pattern_helper.js#L321.

7959,2017-01-31 21:36:56,"> The bots fail at `annotation-fileattachment.pdf`. I don't think that's coincidence, but opening that file manually in the viewer works just fine. Any ideas as to why this fails here?

Normally I take great care to run all applicable tests locally, but here I forgot to do that since I didn't think that any of changes in the `src/` folder would matter. Obviously I was wrong, since the `LinkServiceMock` used by the test-suite was missing (now) required methods.
The best solution would probably be if we could use the [`SimpleLinkService`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/pdf_link_service.js#L425) in the tests, but for now I've amended the `LinkServiceMock` in `test/driver.js` with all the missing methods.

@timvandermeij Thanks for pointing out exactly where the tests failed, since that helped me to very quickly pinpoint the exact location of the problem.",Snuffleupagus,timvandermeij

I agree with that. I'm sorry if the question was not clear. I was resolving #7261 for bidi.js, but I found this particular issue that seems to break.

So, should I add the full suite of unit tests that was meant to resolve #7261, or as an interim, just tests to ensure that this particular logic (percentage of RTL text) doesn't regress?",Skaty,yurydelendik

7916,2016-12-29 00:08:43,"@yurydelendik, the general idea is that you'd use a module loader, such as `require.js` to load `viewer.js`and, then, run it at an appropriate lifecycle of the page/web application. PDF.js is already module-loader compatible in its core: `pdf.js` and `pdf.worker.js`. This PR would allow the same paradigm for `viewer.js` as well.

One of drawbacks of the current state of `viewer.js` is that it is hardcoded loading upon _DOM loaded_ event. Yet some advance uses may require additional setup/layout/etc. work to be done before `viewer.js` loads and displays a PDF file.

I'll try to change the test files as well to use `require.js` with `viewer.js`, as a reference implementation.",sindilevich,yurydelendik
7916,2016-12-31 19:26:37,"@Snuffleupagus, reverted the indentation and fixed `viewer.html` to absorb the module nature of `viewer.js`. Am not 100% sure about the way I've handled `DEFAULT_URL`, maybe the `viewer.js` module itself should put it global, through the `pdfjs/display/global` module.

@yurydelendik, `viewer.html` consumes the module version of `viewer.js` now. Sometimes it is required the window with a PDF.js viewer will show a PDF only at a later stage in page's lifecycle. For example, a customer requirement: the user gives his/her consent to view a PDF file on the PDF viewer page itself; only users that have explicitly agreed can view the PDF; user consent is audited and logged. Another example: using PDF.js as a part of a tabbed page, without an `iframe`; only display a PDF, when you switch to the PDF viewer tab. I am pretty sure that 1) breaking the hardcoded dependency on the `DOMContentLoaded` event, 2) introducing a mechanism of a manual bootstrap of the PDF.js viewer, and 3) tidying up the global scope even more brings its benefit in a vast majority of development scenarios.

I hope you'd agree. Thank you in advance.",sindilevich,yurydelendik
7916,2017-01-05 18:36:34,"@yurydelendik, thank you for the review. I can think about yet another commit that will solve the enhancement №4: ""_refactor UI to not use document.getElementById or similar queries from global page context_"".

I could make the `viewer.js.run()` method take an `options: Object` parameter. One of the properties of the `options` method would be called, say, `host: DOMElement`. Then I could revise other parts of the `viewer.js` suite to use that `host` object as the scope for DOM queries and events.

The only tricky part here, is the very different nature of `viewer.js` when it is compiled vs. at development. The compiled `viewer.js` keeps all the other modules inside of itself. That way declaring a variable at the scope of the enclosing IIFE, makes this variable accessible by every part that comprises `viewer.js`. When working with the sources, you somehow need to pass that reference to the DOM element from outside to every module, required by `viewer.js`.

I would like to hear your opinion, please.",sindilevich,yurydelendik
7916,2017-01-05 18:57:07,"@yurydelendik, this PR already resolves items: 1, 2, and 3. But I don't feel myself confident enough in PDF.js codebase to also resolve items 4 and 5. Would be glad for any help, though.",sindilevich,yurydelendik

Thanks for commenting. I wholeheartedly agree with you over most of the points you mentioned.

As far as beginner thing is concerned, a beginner to PDF.js doesn't necessarily mean beginner to JavaScript and its ecosystem. Also, including `SimpleViewer` would have done the job, but it is too difficult to extend the underlying API/behavior and point of the article was to give users the ability to use low-level APIs PDF.js provide to build an extensible solution matching their needs.

I appreciate your feedback. I' am closing the issue.

Thanks",ilatif,Snuffleupagus

Resizing window is going to call PageView.update(scale, rotation).

In the [repository](https://github.com/Vi-dot/ng2-pdf-viewer), you can find the functions in [pdf-viewer.component.ts](https://github.com/Vi-dot/ng2-pdf-viewer/blob/page-view-way/src/pdf-viewer/pdf-viewer.component.ts) file : 
- renderPage(pageNumber: number) -> used at start to draw each PageView
- refreshSize() -> used on window resizing to update each PageView without reloading all the PageView

Thanks for your help",Vi-dot,timvandermeij

Same for `pdfViewer.currentScale = newScale;`, do you know if everything is reloaded ?

7841,2016-11-25 13:17:33,"> I'm not sure it is a right approach to disable them completely for the iOS.

Perhaps not, but it's a simple one and we *really* don't want to waste a lot of development/testing time on fine-tuning `compatibility.js`. Its purpose is to make it possible to use (most) browsers that have missing/broken features together with PDF.js out of the box, but you're certainly free to not use `compatibility.js`, or to modify it to suite your needs, in custom deployments.
Generally speaking we will err on the side of caution, and disable some features perhaps unnecessarily for certain browsers (for simplicity), since more fine-grained feature testing is often difficult.

> Though I did experience the same issue as @Snuffleupagus in WeChat and the way I've fixed it was similar to #7822 .

Please note that I've never used, nor have I claimed to use, the WeChat browser (which seems to be specific to the Chinese market).",Snuffleupagus,Snuffleupagus

As far as OPS.setTextMatrix @Snuffleupagus mentioned in the review of the earlier version of the pull request, I'm pretty new to the guts of the PDF spec, but at first glance, it would appear it suffers from a similar comparison issue.

From the same review of the earlier version of the pr by @yurydelendik ""Does it require resetting textContentItem.lastAdvanceWidth/lastAdvanceHeight to different value?"": Again, I'm pretty new to this but I think you are right, because if there's a series of textMove and showText commands it will continue appending to the same textContentItem since the moveText branch that calls addFakeSpaces then skips flushing the current textContentItem.  

It seems to me (a bit sleep deprived at the moment though) that this branch doesn't account for the moveText command then in the textContentItem - seems it should add to lastAdvanceWidth/Height and/or the width/height for where this move was supposed to be.  I haven't dug in enough to determine if it should just be accounting for the width of the fake spaces inserted or for the full ""diff"".

If anyone is familiar with this code and can help me wrap my head around this, would appreciate any insight.  Otherwise will need to look at this with a clearer head, which probably may not happen until next week as I'm traveling right now.

Here, besides the original patch by @brendandahl which already fixes the majority of the problem, I'm also amending `src/core/glyphlist.js` with the (common) names used in AMSmath Type1 (La)TeX fonts.
This is based on lists of TeX glyph names, and reasonable Unicode values, that I found while searching the web. Hopefully this should be enough to avoid mapping these math symbols to regular characters, thus preventing FreeType from using the wrong glyphs when computing hint values, and should also improve text-selection at the same time.

If this is a reasonable approach, we probably need a couple of Linux users (currently affected by the issue) to test this to ensure that it's in fact a sufficient solution.

code was just moved to the pdf_print_service.js

> Now the code has two code paths, one where mozPrintCallback is available and one where it is not. 

For simplicity, web/demo viewer will never use mozPrintCallback -- it is in bad shape now (see [1308259](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1308259) and [1308579](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1308579)) and performs rasterization like we do, and yes, for the extension we continue using mozPrintCallback just not create a drastic change. If decision to improve/remove mozPrintCallback will be made we can either use firefox_print_callback in the pdf_print_callback or remove firefox_print_callback.

> How does this not affect printing behavior (or how does the change improve the behavior)?

The changes are: 
- Firefox in the demo viewer prints the same way IE or Chrome and quality of output shall be a little bit better (due to png)
- No style hacks in the Firefox extension code
- Better readability of the printing logic within viewer
- Ability to replace CANVAS/PNG with SVG output

I don't think I'd be able to write a decent PR to do that simply because the codebase is very difficult to modify without significant prior knowledge. 

<hr/>

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it doesn't seem like the PR itself has any bugs in it, just that it could be optimized. My users and I are experiencing significant lag in reading PDFs due to #7612 and have been for the past 4 weeks (and I'm not the only one facing this bug), so I would sincerely appreciate if a fix could be released ASAP.

As such, do you think we could get this PR merged first as it fixes the _major_ performance bug in #7612? I can make the changes to `/examples` as requested by @timvandermeij 
Then you could make a separate PR to optimize that code at a later time; as I'm sure with your prior experience and deep understanding of the codebase that would take very little time (as opposed to me struggling with it for many hours on end).

Please let me know if that's possible and thank you for your understanding.

@benweet Could you check if using `<button>` elements might help, or if you can improve accessibility (tabbing) of the hidden input fields? It could help determine what the best thing to do here would be. If those options do not work, I also suggest to just use regular checkboxes and radio buttons without styling for now and figure out styling in a follow-up PR.

Thanks for fixing this. However this brakes stuff in our app related to normal selection (click and drag). We rely on using [`Range.getClientRects`](http://devdocs.io/dom/range/getclientrects) to calculate selection boundaries and with the timeout we get wrong values there.

Because this fix is for double-clicking, I found following solves my problem and keeps the fix:

7612,2016-09-08 18:50:56,"> Check if bundle.js includes worker -- it's wrong (from page loading performance and size) to have it there. Entire pdf.worker.js file shall be placed into separate bundle.

Checked the bundled code and can confirm It does not include the worker. As I mentioned, the worker script is bundled as `1.bundle.js`. Upon loading a PDF, a script tag for `1.bundle.js` is inserted into my `<head>` tag (not sure if this is from PDFJS or webpack).

> pdf.worker.bundle.js file you create as a bundle output that includes pdf.worker.js module (imported from pdfjs-dist)

Is there an example that uses the first, and arguably preferred, method in the Wiki of loading the worker script from `node_modules`? From the wiki section: ""The worker shall be built into a separate bundle: take the file ""./node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.entry.js""

@yurydelendik could you elaborate on the auto-detection/loading of the worker in #6595  that seems to no longer be in the codebase? I'm building a library that uses pdf.js, so if someone had to import pdf.js code to make my library work, that would be fairly tedious (managing dependencies of dependencies).

> The description of the issue is not clear. Can you provide complete example source code?

I didn't attach source code as there's really not much else helpful or relevant, but here's a ~50 line summary: http://pastebin.com/raw/PHs6bfby. The `file` argument is literally a file from an `<input type='file' />` element.

So far we did not find a bundler that properly manages web worker and we don't want give preferences to webpack or browserify -- we had problem with supporting both at the same time. 

The solution is to managing dependencies of dependencies is not trivial. But keep in mind that efficient parsing and rendering of PDFs is not trivial task. If you abandon using web worker, and you are free to do that, the UI performance will suffer and it will be your trade-off.

You can publish small example of a library that demonstrate the intent of what you are trying to achieve. Provided snippets of the code is not useful since they are not: runnable and not what you are trying to do -- a library.

@yurydelendik I'd agree with you but I don't think that trade-off needs to be made. Webpack has [worker-loader](https://github.com/webpack/worker-loader) and Browserify has [webworkify](https://github.com/substack/webworkify) -- wouldn't detecting the bundler system and using one or the other completely solve this problem?

Seems like it could be done here: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/display/api.js#L1132, using the direct path to the worker entry with
`var worker = require('worker!../pdf.worker.entry.js')` in webpack or
`var worker = require('webworkerify')('../pdf.worker.entry.js')` in browserify.
If you think I hit the mark with that, I'd be happy to write a PR for that.

> You can publish small example of a library that demonstrate the intent of what you are trying to achieve. Provided snippets of the code is not useful since they are not: runnable and not what you are trying to do -- a library.

The snippet I attached is all of the code that would be in the library for now (`pdf-to-dataURL`). I could make a quick example that uses that snippet if @jlchereau's example isn't good enough (it doesn't seem to require `pdfjs-dist` from NPM, so not sure about the accuracy of it)
",agilgur5,yurydelendik
7612,2016-10-01 01:51:10,"@yurydelendik it doesn't seem like you checked out @jlchereau's example yet. I also made [pdf-to-dataURL](https://github.com/agilgur5/pdf-to-dataURL) as a tiny package that exhibits this bug.

> I was planning to add overloaded constructor for PDFWorker that would accept an web worker is a parameter -- this might provide the alternative solution for some webpack/browserify usecases.

Are there any updates on this? As I previously mentioned, I feel that's a much better solution than the one I proposed (to which you hadn't answered the questions I asked so I couldn't really make a PR anyway) and is far more generic for future use cases and other bundlers.

7554,2016-08-21 12:40:42,"@Rob--W Thank you very much for the review, I will be working on this.

While simplifying the parsing, I am hoping to get your opinion regarding the strictness of parsing. Should we 
- Make sure that the entire Content-Disposition header be strictly valid before extracting a file name, or
- Get a filename if possible ignoring other issues in the header?

Examples of invalid (but 'parse'able) headers
1. `filename=xyz.pdf` (No Type)
2. `; filename=xyz.pdf` (No Type)
3. `inline; filename=xyz.pdf;` (Trailing semi-colon)
4. `inline; filename=xyz.pdf; filename=abc.pdf` (Duplicate filename)
5. `inline; filename=xyz.pdf; foo=bar,baz` (Invalid value for foo)
6. `inline; filename=xyz.pdf; foo=bar; foo=baz`(Duplicate foo)

My opinion is to make sure that the structure is in place before finding the filename, but ignore issues in other parameters. So invalidate 1, 2 & 3 above and parse 4, 5 & 6.

What do you think?

7554,2016-08-21 13:28:27,"@timvandermeij Using 'as-is' may not be possible because [it is written for Node](https://github.com/jshttp/content-disposition/blob/master/index.js#L273). As far as parsing is concerned, this use of `Buffer` is the only issue I can see though.
",anoopelias,timvandermeij
7554,2016-08-23 04:42:34,"@timvandermeij I made an implementation with the approach of adding the `index.js` from the upstream npm module to the `external` folder here in pdf.js. Please see [this](https://github.com/anoopelias/pdf.js/commit/b71470742fd8559f11e27c33daa7df1134f76060) commit. (This is not for review, it still needs more work, though I wanted to give you an idea how I am thinking this can be implemented).

I do not feel fully comfortable with this approach yet for the following reasons,
- The `webL10n` that you mentioned is loaded in the html and is used only in the web side. Currently there are no external libraries that pdf.js uses at API level. However, the content-disposition library is needed in worker and api. Simply, there is no precedence for something like this here that I can follow.
- I ruled out attaching an additional function to `document` similar to how `webL10n` is doing, because worker do not have access to dom. I had to introduce a new require.js namespace `external/` to load files from 'external/' folder for the worker. This has caused [more changes](https://github.com/anoopelias/pdf.js/commit/b71470742fd8559f11e27c33daa7df1134f76060?diff=unified#diff-1b8c182818eb0b07156c9e1fe80346aaR7) from the original upstream library than I hoped for.
- Original `content-disposition` npm module has only been tested with Node.js. When we bring it in to `pdf.js`, it will get used in across all browsers and browser versions. However, since we are adding it as an `external/` library, we do not inherit any tests here in `pdf.js`.

Right now, I think @Rob--W 's opinion of duplicating a cut down portion of the original implementation is a better idea. Please let me know what you think.

I'm not entirely sure I understand why that is better than what you had before, since it's now no longer possible for a user of `PDFViewer` (e.g. in a [viewer components](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/examples/components) based viewer) to choose the text selection mode without actually modifying the code.

Since we now intend to enable the improved text-selection mode enabled by default, would it not make more sense to instead invert the setting in `PDFViewer`/`PDFPageView`?
I.e. we would have something like `disableEnhanceTextSelection` properties on the `PDFViewerOptions`/`PDFPageViewOptions`, which defaults to `false`.

@yurydelendik Opinions on the above?

**_Edit:**_ Perhaps something like the following?


",Snuffleupagus,yurydelendik
7539,2016-08-24 13:26:43,"> @yurydelendik Opinions on the above?

I would keep enhanceTextSelection on core API side. I don't have opinion for the viewer API. Since it's new functionality, I recommend to keep components backward compatible. In this case we may control selection enhancement state via constants. (Perhaps we can even remove those, but they provide some type of documentation for the literal boolean value.)

Memory/CPU: results were similar to previous testing, no significant differences. When it comes to selection, both this commit and master are similar as well.

Render Times: The introduction of the text div expansion adds between 150-100 ms on first click, and 60-100 ms on subsequent clicks. This is possibly the sluggish scrolling that @Snuffleupagus reported. I only noticed this very slightly on the initial click of the highlight, dragging it around still felt as performant to me as on master. (testing done with text layer not visible)

Highlight Fidelity: On these documents there isa drop in ability to highlight. I tested it with #7387 and it does significantly improve the situation. The problem can be seen in this [gif](http://giphy.com/gifs/l0MYQOJMi6NCORO9i), where the highlight starts where the expanded divs are set, and returns to their normal position on mouse up.

I don't know how many documents have these specific problems, but until #7387 lands I would consider this a regression. Additionally, with the potential optimization to the expand method, I see the fidelity as more of an issue than the performance. Also, a tweak to the algorithm may prevent the text layer divs from dropping on these files

Looks like you'll need object 18 until 22. Object 19 & 20 are compressed (FlateDecode) streams, so I'm affraid pasting that binary data here will not work, but I'll give it a try anyway. **I have also attached the decompressed objects 19 and 20 to this post**.

(e.g `PDFJS.locale = (PDFJS.locale === undefined ? navigator.language : PDFJS.locale`);

How about using `<html lang="""">` attribute (website language) to define interface language - if webpage uses another language - change the language in the interface. If html lang is not set use navigator navigator.userLanguage? I mean if we are going to have 5 different languages we need to overwrite the PDFJS.locale every time?

What do you think?

**PS! Please do update documentation regarding localization and provide a working example.**

7408,2016-06-16 22:08:31,"@Rob--W: I think I'm a little confused about the intent behind this ticket. Initially I thought that moving towards reusing classes from viewer.css would be the way to go, since the styles would be consistent with the other dialogs. However, you noted that you wanted this snippet to be able to live independently of viewer.css, which makes sense for reusability of this particular component, but not necessarily towards stylistic cohesion across dialogs. If I begin referencing viewer.css classes in the snippet, doesn't that defeat the purpose of keeping its styles inline and easily parseable as an independent component?

The compromise I went with here is just to explicitly copy over the styles from viewer.css inline (the font-size of the password dialog is 12px, which I personally think could be bumped up to 14px for both). I agree that this may not be necessary, but I'm not sure how else to fulfill both desires of making this dialog stylistically similar to the others, while also maintaining its independence as a reusable component. Again, I'm hopeful to contribute as much as makes sense, but I'm not exactly clear on what our goals are here.
",raymondwang,Rob--W
7408,2016-06-18 12:02:01,"I like how this PR is developing. The screenshot above shows exactly what I have in mind for the printing dialog, which is to make it look like the other dialogs such as the password prompt dialog. It is good to see that this also saves quite a bit of CSS in the snippet, and only overrides remain.

I'll leave the final review for @Rob--W, but in general the patch looks good to me. Thank you for working on this, and welcome to the project!

7386,2016-06-06 14:49:47,"Before we attempt to upstream that patch, I think that it would really help if we made a decision about the _minimum_ Firefox version that we intend to support with the development addon.

Currently we've got quite a bit of fallback code for fairly old Firefox versions in `PdfStreamConverter.jsm` (and `PdfjsChromeUtils.jsm`), and given the lack of testing, I wouldn't be surprised if the development addon is already semi-broken in older Firefox versions.

My suggestion is thus that we should limit support for the development addon to the _currently shipping_ ESR version, which as of this writing is `45`. This would considerably reduce the amount of necessary fallback code, and greatly simplify testing.

7377,2016-06-03 11:17:31,"Thanks for your reply @yurydelendik 

I found that by forcing disableRange to true or false, by hacking the code in compatibility.js - this made no difference at all. I even reset my iPad back to factory settings to make sure it wasn't a caching issue.

I have no idea why, but the issue seemed to originate from my environment itself, when I upload the web-app I'm working on to an FTP server, the problem goes away.

I was serving up my web-app through MAMP on OSX, and accessing it on the iPad via my network IP address, i.e.  `http://192.168.0.123:8888`

Whether the problem is MAMP, my machine, my network, the iPad - I do not know.

7312,2016-05-11 07:52:00,"@timvandermeij I expect the majority of the users to be at the latest version, and running ancient versions of Chrome is very stupid (because of security vulnerabilities). However, given the lot of users, I expect that it is not unlikely to have at least a few thousand users who are still using an old Chrome version.

My immediate need is indeed determining whether it's safe to drop support for Chrome 35, but the statistics can also be useful in determining whether it's safe to use newer Chrome APIs that are backwards-incompatible. For instance, the [declarativeWebRequest API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/declarativeWebRequest) allows for a more efficient use of system resources. Currently it is only available on non-stable Chrome releases. If it becomes available for stable, then I can use [event pages](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/event_pages) instead of background pages. But event pages cannot be used with the [webRequest API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/webRequest), so I cannot switch until I know that it won't affect users.

In either way, there are too many users that depend on the extension, so I want to make informed decisions (based on real data) instead of an unfounded estimate.

@yurydelendik probably my description of the problem was a bit confusing, sorry. the ""source"" pdf has the TextRenderingMode.ADD_TO_PATH text, while the one processed with ghostscript has that text turned into an image.

the source pdf has the text drawn inside the CanvasGraphics_endText() function, while the processed one has the image drawn inside CanvasGraphics_paintJpegXObject().

> @cvlmtg is there an option to disable JPEG and make it JBIG2/CCITT?

No idea, I should do more experiments with ghostscript. I think that at a certain point the image was drawn inside CanvasGraphics_paintInlineImageXObject() instead of CanvasGraphics_paintJpegXObject() so I suppose something changed about the compression or the image format, but honestly I don't remember when and how it happened. However on both cases the rendering was still poor.

> duplicate of #7041 ?

it may be for the rendering of the processed pdf, where the text has been turned to a bitmap by ghostscript. but on the source pdf the issue is with canvas paths drawing. this is what happens on windows 7 with the source pdf (i.e. the text is still text)

![immagine](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6401008/15008011/5aca956e-11dd-11e6-8006-f9dd4fb839c9.png)

so it seems there are some issues with path rendering on canvas inside CanvasGraphics_endText(). On OSX the result is the one showed in my first message, while on Windows the result is much worse as shown above.

thanks for the help!

7285,2016-05-05 09:37:08,"> Debugging the higher level ref tests when broken is often very painful, where as a unit test the issue is usually immediately obvious. In hindsight, I think we should have made much more of our ref tests into font unit tests.

That is certainly a very valid point; one that I didn't really consider!
One possible problem with creating small/self-contained unit-tests, is that for e.g. `TrueType` fonts (which is what most of _my_ font patches have touched), it might not be that easy to do.
For example: Most of the helper functions in [`Font_checkAndRepair`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/fonts.js#L1223) are local, and you'd probably want a way to test only parts of that functionality in an issue/bug specific unit-test. Should we perhaps split some of those local functions out into ""class"" methods instead?

> You've probably also run into the situation where a reftest breaks and you have no idea why without some pretty deep digging.

I have, on more than one occasion, and I agree that it's no fun at all.

> [...] but I think this patch is nevertheless good to have because the two parsers are also in separate files in src/core.

Yes, as Tim points out, this patch is more of a bookkeeping one, moving existing unit-tests to the correct files. Please note that it _does not_ remove any existing tests.

@brendandahl So in summary: If we block this PR on adding unit-tests for `fonts.js`, I'm not sure when it'll land, so can we take this and track adding unit-tests for `fonts.js` in e.g. #7261 instead?

7188,2016-04-17 12:35:18,"I can reproduce this at _some_ zoom levels, but _not_ at others, which seems very strange.
Interestingly enough, if I use the `Stepper` to render the file one operation at a time, it always works correctly _regardless_ of zoom level. Furthermore, if I force the use of the `mozCurrentTransform` polyfill, https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/display/canvas.js#L92-L93, it also works regardless of zoom level.

All this suggests, to me, that `this.ctx.{mozCurrentTransform,mozCurrentTransformInverse}` intermittently returns incorrect values (perhaps the previous ones?).
So one solution, that I've seen mentioned on IRC as a solution for the general transformation mess in `canvas.js`, might be that we track the transforms ourselves, to avoid these (apparent) platform issues.

However, in the meantime, I've found a possible workaround:



@yurydelendik Would the code above be an acceptable workaround? If so, I'll happily submit a PR!

THE problem I was having, which although not consistent was 100% reproduceable, that's gone. It was (IMHO) caused by overlap between document operations, i.e. a process starting before the previous one had finished - threading or not, putting in a manual lock to prevent operations starting before the previous one had finished fixed it. The easily reproduced example was quickly scanning forward through a document and having the ""next"" start processing before the previous page had completely finished rendering.",oddjobz,yurydelendik
7136,2016-12-19 18:30:46,"@yurydelendik This is happening pretty consistently for our users (mainly using Windows 7), but I've been able to reproduce it on OSX with the latest version, but not 100% consistently. 

We are not using any custom code, simply doing the following


It seems to depend on  a number of factors, such as whether there is any other bold text in the document, and the initial zoom level (zooming in and out will sometimes fix it) I've also noticed that this only affects the preview, and printing, when downloading the pdf it appears to render perfectly (I guess that's because pdf.js is just passing the provided file along to the user).

We have decided to move away from using this solution and downloading the file to the users machine directly, but I will try make some time to come up with a reproducible test-case though I already spent my entire day yesterday chasing this bug down..

7084,2016-03-13 21:00:28,"I have pushed a new commit that should resolve not only the error, but also the differences in the diff created by `gulp` and `node make`. The cause of the latter issue was rather hard to find. The key is that `gulpfile.js` registers all tasks from `make.js`. This means that we call the tasks manually for Gulp, but if parameters were originally passed to the target, they were not passed along by our registering layer. This resulted in different diffs because https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/make.js#L922 would successfully pass the parameters in the `node make` case, but not in the `gulp` case because of the broken override.

@Snuffleupagus Could you check this again?

7084,2016-03-13 22:05:13,"> @Snuffleupagus Could you check this again?

This looks much better!
One small thing though, it seems that the version number (i.e. `var pdfjsVersion = '...';`) in the `mozcentral.diff` file becomes wrong intermittently. I'm not sure if this is a pre-existing issue or not, but it seems a lot more common with `gulp` than `make`.

**Edit:** It seems that `target.buildnumber` doesn't always find the correct version when it's called from other code.

Aso for `PDFJS.renderTextLayer` it doesn't exist unless I include `src/display/text_layer.js` in my project. I am getting `PDFJS` from `pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.js` using the [pdfjs-dist](http://npm.im/pdfjs-dist) npm module.

7069,2016-03-08 19:31:50,"> Seems like it would be a good idea to make a general function for getting the unicode from glyph name.

Sure, that sounds fine! The only one I can remember seeing in practice is `uniXXXX`, but I suppose it can't hurt to support the `uXXXX/uXXXXXX` case as well.

@brendandahl How closely do you want that function to mimic what the FreeType code does?
Should we enforce only upper-case hexadecimal chars, to prevent accidentally matching things that are not actually hex numbers?
",Snuffleupagus,brendandahl
7069,2016-03-09 14:04:54,"I've added a `getUnicodeForGlyph` helper function, similarly to the FreeType one, which is used in various places to do the `glyphName -> Unicode` conversion.
I kept the `recoverGlyphName`, which is using `getUnicodeForGlyph` internally, since we may need both the standard/non-standard glyph names when creating the `charCodeToGlyphId` map for TrueType fonts.

@brendandahl Is this what you had in mind?

> I'm a bit afraid that the `setInitialView` method becomes too cluttered with all the added logic and parameters.

This is exactly what I was thinking. I didn't make any changes in the flow of code since I was told to follow the rotation persistence PR, but passing these options through different function parameters might be a bad idea, as they the options tend to increase. 

> Do you have any idea if there is something we can do to prevent this?

I think there can be two solutions for this:
- The first one is the passing of a dictionary object in the `setInitialView` method with all the required values.
- The second one would be to simply skip passing any new parameter and directly use the `store` variable to get the desired values inside `setInitialView` method. However, this may hurt clarity.

What do you think? Let me know. Thanks.

I am unable to reproduce this bug. Please let me know. Thanks.
",ankitaggarwal011,timvandermeij
7010,2016-04-13 13:43:49,"I have rebased the patch with the master. Phew! 

I am able to reproduce this issue your talking about as well. I hope we would be able to close this soon.

**Update:**
@timvandermeij, @Snuffleupagus, I think I have found the bug related to the above mentioned issue. After opening any pdf file, `visibleView` is equal to the last set value (say 0, sidebar closed), then if you will open the sidebar, the value of the `visibleView` will change. (to say 1, Thumbnail view). Now, if you will change the view to Outline, `visibleView` does not change to 2, but it should. However, at this time, if one would close the sidebar and then reopen, the value of the `visibleView` is successfully changed to 2.

Thus, during @timvandermeij testing, he is getting the same `visibleView` that was set before, but it's not the right view because the value of `visibleView` didn't change with the transition from Thumbnail->Outline view or Outline->Thumbnail view.

Upon further testing, I found out that the pdf_sidebar is behaving as expected and the active view is getting changed during the transition, however the ``updateviewarea` event if not fired during the transition from Thumbnail->Outline view or Outline->Thumbnail view. Thus, the current view is not getting saved in case of a transition. Is there any other event fired during such a transition which we can use to set the sidebarView value as current view.

What do you think? Please let me know. Thanks.

Alright I have performed some additional work to further and more adequately describe the problem.

You can see the test environment here: http://environment7.net23.net

On most browsers, especially desktop, it works just fine. On Android , that is where the main problem begins. However any device with low CPU speed performs poorly, and it appears to be whenever a scroll occurs, the framerate drops to 7 or lower and the CPU maxes out. 

As far as ram goes:
- Chrome(Desktop):  48mb
- **IE**9 Desktop:  **230mb**
- Android :: Chrome: 36mb
- Android :: Stock Webkit Browser: *\* 148mb**
- Windows tablet **IE**11:  **85mb**

I didn't bother testing Mozilla firefox, as it works extremely well on all devices (massive performance boost).

After much testing and profiling, I don't believe the problem is PDF.js library, but that old devices (low cpu, low ram) can't handle it properly. 
**If I were to re-ask my question, I would ask you why the different browsers have such a profound difference in memory usage. Why so high on android and IE?**

Thanks; I've actually tried to reduced the size of the total diff as best as I could.
I suppose that one of the remaining things we need to do, is to get consensus that it's actually OK to remove the ""Page:"" label from the toolbar.

> @Snuffleupagus Do you want to address #6945 (comment) in a separate commit too? It would be nice to fix the responsiveness issues as well, which this patch already partially fixes.

I think I'd prefer if that was done in a follow-up instead, since it might not be as easy as it first seems.

Keep in mind that even without the ""Page:"" label in the toolbar, for documents that use Page Labels, some (or even all) of the space saving could actually be offset by the longer `numPages` label.
This is obviously dependent on the number of pages in the document (e.g. consider cases where numPages > 1000), and also what locale is being used (since the length of the ""of"" label differs between languages).
_Note:_ Even in English, the space saving isn't necessarily that great, this is how it looks with [lshort.pdf](http://mirrors.ctan.org/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf):

![page-label-diff](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2692120/17666852/8810a75e-6302-11e6-95a8-d22f62a77154.png)

Sounds good: we can remove it.

6923,2016-01-26 21:24:01,"I'm sorry, but I don't understand the question about removing the `ignoreStandardNumbering` parameter. This PR _adds_ it, in order to fix an issue with the current API.

In practice, it's unfortunately more common than you might think for PDF files to include pageLabels that correspond to ""normal"" page numbering. In the viewer I think that we'll want to be able to ignore these, which seem to happen in Adobe Reader as well, since they don't add any real value.

The point of this PR is thus to let us skip such pageLabels, by using the parameter, while still enabling API consumers to always retrieve pageLabels if/when they exist in the PDF file.
Otherwise we would have a situation where `getPageLabels` in the API will return `null`, with no way of telling if that's because no pageLabels exist, or if it's caused by them being equal to ""normal"" numbering.

@yurydelendik, @timvandermeij Are you saying that we should just ignore pageLabels using ""normal"" numbering, and not care about the API being unable to retrieve the pageLabels as defined in the PDF file in those cases?

6895,2016-01-18 15:20:23,"> We remove yo01. The file is not available, it was introduced in 3529658 along with another test file (so we should not need it) and it was replaced in 6b2c6fc, so it was only in the repository for a very short time.

I'm not sure if I agree with this conclusion, since I see no indication that `usmanm-bad-auto-fetch` was intended to _replace_ `yo01`. It rather seems to me that it's more likely that, given that it was already unavailable at the time of that patch, it might have been removed a little to hastily.

I'm assuming that the two files added in 3529658 doesn't demonstrate entirely identical issues, since otherwise I cannot image why both were added. @timvandermeij Did you verify that both those files failed in _the same_ way previously?
(I've been meaning to replace `yo01` with a reduced test-case, but I've not yet had the time).

And in the interface all functions are anonymous. Is that intentional? With the similarly named methods in the different interfaces (e.g. `read`), grepping may be easier if the interface name is included in the function name. I don't mind either way, pick your preference.

If you open these with any PDF reader, so will see a popup when you hover over them or click them. This is because practically any annotation type can have an associated Popup annotation according to the specification. This happens very often. My recent patches add support for this interactivity. Open the files above with PDF.js now and you will notice the popup coming up when you hover over the annotations. Clicking them will pin or unpin them.

We have #6810 for supporting annotations without appearance streams (those are not rendered right now) and #6811 for supporting quad points, so I'm closing this issue as resolved.

6804,2016-11-10 12:40:02,"@Snuffleupagus Thanks for the fix! One comment - it would be nice to be able to apply such fixes by downloading a tagged newer version of pdf.js, instead of applying them manually.

E.g. last 1.3.x version in this repo is 1.3.91 (both in Releases and Tags), while npm latest pdf-dist version is 1.3.233. However, I was not able to find a commit which corresponds to this latest (and I assume more stable than 1.3.91) version. 

Is there a way to find this commit? I cannot find the date when this version was released. It would be useful, if for example pdfjsbot would update version number in package.json and bower.json, and commit on each deploy. This should be quite simple to do

The print setup should have rotated pg2 to match the paper stock (or left it to the print device), and then applied a fit-to-page  transform, if requested.  I.e. there are interactions between F2P and autoRotate.

It'd probably be much easier to just open the PDF file in a desktop PDF viewer, such as e.g. Adobe Reader, for this kind of use-case. As @timvandermeij said, given the very special nature of this feature, I don't think it really makes sense for us to try and implement this in PDF.js.

Could we add an option to use ""F11 full-screen"" mode instead of presentation mode when the button is clicked when the PDF has a portrait orientation? Then Ctrl + Shift + P and F11 will still behave like today, but the fullscreen button gets a more useful default button.

Perhaps a tri-state

2. F11
3. 1 or 2, depending on the page orientation

6681,2015-11-24 14:20:53,"I just realized that in its current form, this patch suffers from a quite annoying issue.
Even though the textLayer is rendered correctly, when you try to search, the textLayer reverts to the previous broken alignment.
Even though the initial textLayer `<div>` has replaced the tabs, both `TextLayerBuilder` and `PDFFindController` keep a reference to the result of [`getTextContent`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/display/api.js#L887), which obviously contains the ""original"" textLayer content without the whitespace conversion.

Replacing whitespaces with a regexp at every point where the viewer code is doing `getTextContent` seems quite cumbersome and ineffective, so I'm wondering if we could perhaps extend the API by adding a parameter for [`getTextContent`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/display/api.js#L887) that will return the text with the whitespace conversion done inside of e.g. https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/evaluator.js#L911 instead?

@yurydelendik How do you think that we should proceed here?

It seems that only 11 of these actually contain font files, while the rest of them are ""standard"" non-embedded fonts.
@brendandahl Does a reduced test-case need to include _all_ fonts, or would it suffice if it included just the ones with font files? If the latter is OK, I doesn't seem _too_ hard to create a reduced test-case for this.

I think it would be okay to just test the included ones.

When I click on the blank space as a user (e.g. to focus the window?), then it is very realistic that the mouse moves by a few pixels. When that happens I don't want the whole document to be selected.

6587,2015-11-01 16:15:48,"If you're touching this code anyway, I'm wondering if we should take it a bit further by making the size configurable when initializing `ViewHistory`? E.g. something like this:
- in `view_history.js`, change `function ViewHistory(fingerprint) {` to `function ViewHistory(fingerprint, size) {`.
- define `var cacheSize = size || DEFAULT_VIEW_HISTORY_SIZE;` (if we're doing this, a slight rename of the constant might be in order), and compare the length against that value at [view_history.js#L42](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/view_history.js#L42).

@timvandermeij How do you feel about the above?

Note that I have kept the commits separate on purpose as the first one is just moving code and the second one is adding new functionality. For the sake of consistency I did not use `var cacheSize`, but `this.cacheSize` instead as that has also been done for the fingerprint in the code (and it seems good to make this a class variable).

Could you check this patch again?

6448,2015-09-14 13:55:25,"@Snuffleupagus That's true - PDF file I posted does not embed any fonts and it's intended.

The font (I posted it too https://www.dropbox.com/s/0gdnwlzlg7vs77d/EskBarCode128_1.ttf?dl=0) is installed in the system. Adobe Reader makes use of it and PDF.js does not.
",brzu,Snuffleupagus
6448,2015-09-14 21:28:09,"@brzu I'm actually a bit confused why you would intentionally want to not embed the font. Adobe recommends embedding fonts for consistent rendering on all systems. If a system does not have your font installed, rendering issues will occur because of font substitution. So unless you have a really good reason not to (font licenses for example), I would definitely recommend embedding the font (which can also be a subset so you do not have to embed the entire font) to avoid issues altogether.

Other than that tip, @yurydelendik's approach is the way to go if you are sure that you do not want to embed the font subset.

6445,2015-10-30 14:04:08,"> The only thing that may be a problem is that `scrollPageIntoView` is called a lot of times when scrolling as far as I know,

@timvandermeij I wonder if you're perhaps thinking of the [`PDFViewer_scrollUpdate`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/pdf_viewer.js#L362`) method, which is called whenever scrolling occurs, through the [`watchScroll`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/pdf_viewer.js#L108) function.

`scrollPageIntoView`, on the other hand, should only be called when the page changes, e.g through the user: clicking on the previous/next buttons in the UI, using the keyboard to change page (<kbd>P</kbd>, <kbd>N</kbd>, ...), or when clicking on an internal link.
Hence I wouldn't expect `scrollPageIntoView` to be a particularly hot method, quite the opposite :-)

It will be an array of objects with `canvas` and `location` properties, which will define location of the canvas on the grid of canvases (Notice that now we will use CANVAS vs its 2d context to know its size; we might add `canvas` property along with `canvasContext`). canvas.js shall render now on multiple contexts at the same time.

> keep the zoom logic for presentation mode

Well, I kind of kept this intentionally because I haven't noticed any issues with it (using ""scroll by 1 page"" option). But now I have tested it with options ""scroll by N line"" for N = {1, 2, 3} and now I see another bugs.
Looks like according to that code 
https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/pdf_presentation_mode.js#L112
there's a ""threshold"" and page is being scrolled only once you reach that value. So if N=3, then you reach it after one ""(Ctrl+)MouseWheelUP""  ( 3 \* 40 = 120 where 40 is another const )
But if N=2, then you need 2 times repeat ""(Ctrl+)MouseWheelUp"" to reach the threshold
If N=1 then you need to repeat that hotkey 3 times.
Note that this is causing problems only on Firefox, because IE & Chrome has wheelDelta >= 120 anyway.

I think the correct behavior here is JUST SCROLL 1 PAGE Up/Down. Maybe it should be different pull request...

> If I recall correctly, zooming in/out uses 3 ticks by default.

Currently, zooming uses
- In Firefox: N ""ticks"" by default where N is your mouse option ""scroll by N lines"". N may be 1 or 2 or 10 or any number. If you choose ""scroll by 1 page"" then N=32768 or -32768. 
- In Chrome: 3 ""ticks"" (or 3*K ticks in some cases. See the next comment).
- In IE: Wow! According to ""Remarks"" on https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/ms536951 , I guess onmousewheel event IS ""stacking"" on IE.
",arni2033,Rob--W
6317,2016-11-05 05:38:22,"@Rob--W 
It's more correct to refer to bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1171659
(PDF Viewer: Ctrl + scroll wheel behavior is different to Ctrl + [+/-]), because 1257815 is Firefox bug

#7181 made the situation somewhat better: now Ctrl+MouseWheelUp is equal to 3 pressings of Ctrl+""+"".
I.e. Ctrl+MouseWheelUp doesn't work exactly as Ctrl+""+"" even after #7181, so this bug is **still present**.
Anyway, I won't have time to work on this/modify PR for at least several month, so you can close it.

If you (team) have already decided that Ctrl+MouseWheelUp should work differently than Ctrl+""+"" (unlike zooming of normal web pages in Firefox/GoogleChrome, zooming; unlike PDF viewer in GoogleChrome), then you can close both this PR and bug 1171659 (in this case, please mark bug 1171659 as ""WONTFIX"" and post your final decision there, so that it is visible on Bugzilla)

I'm wondering/worrying about all of these hash changes too!
@yurydelendik Did you in every case manually confirm that the new version of a PDF file demonstrates the exact same issue as the old one, since otherwise the test might not actually test what you'd expect?

**Edit:** So far, I've only checked the _first_ case of changed hashes, and there the new file version wasn't a good replacement for the old file. So it seems to me that all of the changed hashes need careful verification on a case-by-case basis.

I'm thinking we are at the point when we can just discard all linked PDFs testing, however there is a tiny chance that we might regress something at fonts. I'm using this PR to:
- help beginners to setup efficient testing environment
- use it as a guide to determine which linked PDF must be replaced sooner
- proposing intermediate solution, when we still testing linked PDFs on the servers, but contributors using smaller subset (later we can discard all linked PDF if we determine to do so)

The issue is caused by the difference in heights of the elements at the top row (which in turn is different across different browsers / operating systems because these heights depend on the heights of the button/checkbox elements, which is OS/browser-dependent).

In order to get floated elements to align to the left, the height + vertical margins of the last element(s) (=the one before the label) must be at least as big as the margin of the first element. Here is a snippet to quickly calculate the heights of the children of the findbar:



On Firefox (Linux), the overall height of the checkbox container is 35px, which is bigger than the rest, so the next element starts at the start of the new line.
On Firefox (Windows 7), the overall height of the checkbox container is just 30, which is smaller than the 33px of the button container, so the next element is aligned to the right of the button container.

Firefox 40 (Linux):

**TL;DR** Change the styles such that the heights of the children of `#findbar` are all equal (margin top + margin bottom + height (+border and padding if box-sizing is content-box instead of border-box. we do not specify box-sizing, so the border and padding must be included in the calculation)).

Since the height of certain elements in the Findbar can depend on the browser/OS, I'm not certain that just changing `margin-top` of some elements is guaranteed to always work.

The current code is not actually working as intended, and the implementation is also fairly complicated. Since changing the hash of a loaded document could be considered somewhat of an edge-case, this PR simplifies the implementation to _not_ try to go back (and forward) and modify the previous history entry when the hash is changed by the user.

In my testing, PR #6200 unfortunately seem to introduce other issues; hence I'm not willing to merge it into `master` in its current form. (And I'd rather not spend a whole lot more time testing it, since I still hope that we'll get rid of the code in question.)

For example create a PR for the second commit about `getDestinationHash` (as it seems that that is rather independent of the `PDFHistory` rewrite) and instead of ripping everything out and rewriting it all, incrementally improve the current situation, for example by first creating a PR to streamline the event listener binding from https://github.com/Snuffleupagus/pdf.js/commit/8704aa60fc4ef177bca2bbbfdd6315c10f108804#diff-3b4ebbe223f93c9123a754b4845844e7R456.

It could be somewhat similar to what I did for the initial annotation layer rewrite. I tried to do everything at once, but soon came to the conclusion that is was easier and less error-prone when doing it in smaller parts. It will help to get this functionality landed sooner. What do you think?

The current PR isn't really a complete solution, it just ""hides"" part of the issue.
_Note:_ the piece of code that this patch changes is still wrong, and should be fixed, but it's not enough to make the regression go away on its own.

@timvandermeij It's up to you if you want to take this PR now, or if you prefer that I simply include this change in another PR that actually fixes the issue. (I need to do some more testing, but I should be able to submit the ""real"" solution tomorrow.)

> Could you add cursor:pointer; to the +/- signs? That makes it more clear that the user can click it.

The + / - and getting a different color upon hover offers enough affordance in my opinion. I intentionally used a cursor _different_ from the link, so that it's easier to notice that you're no longer hovering over the link.

> Personally I would leave out the Shift+click and double click actions as they are quite hidden and not really necessary (at least for a first version). For example, it does not really make sense to me that double clicking the outline button will uncollapse all items, and it might even be confusing if it is done on accident.

I do want an option to toggle the whole tree, since clicking on the items one by one is a bit clumsy. In UX, double-clicking is often used to be a stronger version of the single-click. Clicking once shows the outline, and clicking again does nothing at the moment. That's why I used double-click, it shows the outline again (fully expands outline) or collapses the outline (when you double-click again).  
Double-clicking for the +/- icon is inconvenient, because a single click always does something, so double-clicking is a quick show/hide. Attaching ""collapse/expand"" all to double-click on +/- is very confusing, that's why I opted for shift-click. There is no standard for collapse/expand, but some others seem to also agree that ctrl or shift in addition to click makes sense as a trigger (https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/12316/conventional-keyboard-modifier-for-expanding-collapsing-hierarchical-tree-view).

> If we do want those features, we should make them more visible in the UI, but that can be done in a follow-up PR. It would be nice to get the basic functionality without too much code/UI changes first, because from past experiences we know that it is better to add new functionality to the UI more slowly (and to make review easier as we do not have automated tests for the viewer part).

After merging, I plan on adding documentation to the wiki (https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#user-content-what-are-the-pdfjs-keyboard-shortcuts), so it'll be discoverable by users. None of the current shortcuts are discoverable from the UI, so if we're going to e.g. change the tooltip to add the shortcut, then we'd better do that for every item.

I'll play with the styles and follow up soon.

The line height is chosen to be equal to the height, so that the glyph is vertically centered.

In my opinion, the existing code was complicated (it took some efforts to follow the existing logic), and the refactoring into smaller, focused and documented functions enhance the readability / maintainability of this logic.

Possibly yes, but that still needs some review and testing, which may take a while.
But for this PR, I'm certain that it fixes an annoying issue (without introducing regressions).

I think that a possible concern with merging this patch is that your work at #6272 cannot immediately be merged, but that can simply be solved by adding a `git revert` at the start of your PR.

All together, I think that merging this patch has more advantages than disadvantages (to be precise: no advantages for Firefox, known advantages for WebKit/Blink-based browsers, no known disadvantages). If this patch doesn't get merged, I'll include the patch on top of the chrome extension branch (to fix the bug for 500K users).

6191,2015-07-23 21:47:08,"We have had some discussion with the UX team on IRC. Below is the conversation for completeness.

<pre>
*Thunderforge* Hi everyone. There has been a request for help from the UX team regarding the PDF viewer on small screens (via the PDF.js project issue #6191): https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/6191
*Thunderforge* It has been noticed that on small screens, like mobile devices, and when browser-level zoom is used (for accessibility) that the find functionality cannot be used to search through PDFs.
*Thunderforge* In discussing the bug, there was some debate as to what buttons were actually necessary and if it was advisable to allow for find functionality at that small size.
*Thunderforge* One of the collaborators suggested contacting the UX team for help. So here I am doing that. I'm not sure what the proper procedure for this would be, but I am interested in moving forward with this issue as it is an accessibility concern.
*antlam* thunderforge: what’s the bug number?
*Thunderforge* PDF.js #6191 https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/6191
*Thunderforge* That bug discusses it on small screen sizes. There is a duplicate linked to that issue that discusses it in relation to browser-level zoom.
*timvandermeij* Some context on the above: The general issue here is that we (the PDF.js team) need some advise on the best way of handling responsiveness for the PDF viewer. If you open https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html and make the browser width smaller, you will see that the viewer is responsive, but  at very small widths buttons (like the Find button) disappear because there is simply no space. We would like to hear from the UX team: given the full toolbar, which buttons would you definitely keep at small width and which ones can disappear/be put in the >> menu?
*Thunderforge* Our concern was that some items are sent to the >> menu where they are still accessible (e.g. Download, Print). Others disappear, but have an alternate way to use their functionality (zooming can still be done with +/- buttons when the dropdown goes away). Find is the only feature that is completely inaccessible on small screen sizes, either through the >> menu or an alternate means, and cannot be accessed via keyboard shortcut when the button 
*Thunderforge* And thank you for the additional context, @timvandermeij
*timvandermeij* If the UX team thinks that the current responsiveness is fine, then we can find a way to add the Find button and fix some existing overlap issues. If not, then we would like to hear what should be adjusted to improve UX.
*timvandermeij* shorlander: Do you perhaps have ideas regarding this, as you made the original design of the viewer?
*shorlander* timvandermeij: off the top of my head, no. That kind of responsiveness wasn't a consideration at the time.
*timvandermeij* shorlander: Okay, so should we make our own decisions regarding the responsiveness of the toolbar or do you have any advice that we should stick to?
*timvandermeij* We are fine with making the required changes, we just want to make sure that the UX team agrees too and does not find that we have bad UX at the moment, because then we can address that at the same time.
*shorlander* timvandermeij, Thunderforge: I don't know why Find would need to disappear completely and not go into the overflow menu
*shorlander* As long as there is still a way to dismiss it
*Thunderforge* In other words, could it just stay where it is, even at small screen sizes, rather than disappearing completely or being moved into the overflow menu?
*shorlander* Thunderforge: I would prioritize ""Find"" over the zoom drop-down 
*Thunderforge* shorlander: Good to know. If we take out the zoom dropdown and would need even more space, would it be acceptable to have the next/previous buttons disappear, since there are still other ways to navigate?
*Thunderforge* The other ways being scrolling or the page number field.
*shorlander* Thunderforge: yeah, I can't imagine too many people are navigating with those buttons vs. finger scrolling.
*shorlander* But that's just a guess
*shorlander* Button targets are pretty small on a mobile device
*Thunderforge* shorlander: Good point.
</pre>

I think we can summarize the required changes to improve the overall responsiveness as follows:
- Keep the Find button on the toolbar at all times. It is more important for accessibility than for example the zoom dropdown. On top of that, the search box expands below the button, so if we add it to the secondary toolbar, that will not be possible anymore. Note that the Find box itself might need to be made responsive too.
- Resolve overlap issues. These can mostly be fixed by being more strict at which width to transition. If we need more space, the previous/next page buttons should be hidden as they are not necessary on small resolutions (because buttons are small anyway and the user can still scroll and use the page number field).
- Resolve the horizontal scrollbar and cutoff at 300px width.

After those changes, the responsiveness and accessibility are much better and most open issues regarding this are probably fixed at the same time. If someone is willing to work on this, please feel free to create a PR to iterate on the issue.

@Snuffleupagus I did not do that on purpose because this particular code fragment applied it only on the Text and Link annotations. I think it would be fine for the Widget annotations too, but to avoid any regressions I did not do that just yet and kept the code equivalent. I think we can get rid of `hasHtml` in a later refactoring completely though, so it should not be here too long anyway. I think it is better to indicate `hasHtml = true` where necessary instead of overwriting the propertly elsewhere, indeed for readability.

Unless stated otherwise, the patch ""works as intended"", i.e. upon zooming in/out, the part under the cursor is almost fixed (due to conversions from pixels to PDF pixels, and rounding errors, the location can be off by a few pixels after zooming in/out several times).

Keep in mind that many phones have a width of 410px and lower. And on those phones the document info dialog extends way past the bottom of the screen. I don't consider that ""very usable"".

I cleaned up much of the excess array creation, ensured I passed the linter, and applied the style guide rules where I saw I violated them. I'd love another review on this when you get a chance :eyes:

I'm unsure how to test this feature. I'm not the most familiar with this code base and I'm having trouble finding any tests around this. I also am not sure if there is a nice way to force the `Function` constructor to throw an `EvalError` instead of executing. If you had any pointers here they would be greatly appreciated :bow:

6126,2015-08-13 08:20:06,"@yurydelendik I patched l10n to not use sync XHR a while back (#5739), so only cmaps and fonts need to be fixed.

Note that fetch is not yet usable as a full replacement for XHR, because:
- Chrome: Permissions whitelists (e.g. extension permissions, or `--disable-web-security` flag) does not propagate to the `fetch` API https://crbug.com/478345 (**fixed as of 45.0.2402.0**).
- Chrome: Anything other than http: and https: is ignored, including blob:, data:, file:, filesystem: and ftp: URLs. https://crbug.com/455109 (**no fix yet**)
- Design flaw: `fetch` requests cannot be cancelled (like XHR's `abort`). There is no resolution yet, the discussion seems to have stalled due to bikeshedding (https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/27)
- Firefox: `fetch` requests are not aborted upon unload: https://bugzil.la/1165237
- Limitations of polyfills: `fetch` cannot be implemented in terms of XHR (fetch is way more powerful), and `XHR` cannot be implemented in terms of `fetch` (e.g. missing `.abort()`). We should try to get the best of both APIs, and not add an incomplete polyfill that is only an incomplete shim of both APIs).

In theory, fetch supersedes XMLHttpRequest, and `fetch` would replace XHR, but in practice that's not possible yet. `fetch`'s only advantage over XHR (from PDF.js's perspective) is streaming response bodies. Given the above limitations, if we want to use `fetch`, we still have to keep the XHR implementation in the core.

And, note that `fetch` support **does not** imply support for readable body streams. Chrome supported fetch since 42, but streams [were only supported since 43](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5804334163951616).

6103,2015-06-30 16:15:13,"@yurydelendik The purpose of this patch is to allow pages with varying orientation levels to be printed correctly.

For that specific purpose and the given test cases, the patch looks OK to me, but I'm not completely certain whether this special case is always warranted in its current form. For instance, if a PDF is approximately a square (e.g. presentation slides), then flipping the pages because e.g. `501 > 500` doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I'd like to see a stricter logic to address this issue (e.g. changing `pageHeight > pageWidth` to something like `pageHeight > SOME_MINIMUM_ASPECT_RATIO * pageWidth || pageHeight > pageWidth + SOME_MINIMAL_DIFFERENCE`).
",Rob--W,yurydelendik
6103,2015-07-24 09:32:54,"@Hengjie Yes, the question whether unconditionally rotating a page makes sense. I can obviously see that the patch has the desired effect for the provided test PDF files, but I'm not convinced whether it makes sense to unconditionally rotate all pages whose orientation is slightly different (see my previous comment, 6103#issuecomment-117242076).

Another example is a set of pictures that are so small that it doesn't matter whether the page is rotated when printed. Well, after applying your logic, the images will always be rotated, unconditionally.

Do you have any data on distribution of page sizes/orientations for PDF files?

6103,2016-01-06 20:38:19,"@xlc With my given example, if I print the slides of a presentation that perfectly fit on a page, it would be odd to have them rotated.

It might be a good idea to add a new preference to disable auto-rotating, to allow users / embedders to choose whether to rotate a page.
",Rob--W,xlc
6103,2016-01-12 03:14:33,"@Rob--W Sorry I still can't see why auto-rotate is bad.
If all pages are same size, only different orientation, we definitely want auto-rotate.
If some pages have non-standard size, those pages can't be print perfectly fit, rotate will reduce the aspect-ratio difference.
In some edge case, given pages with sizes of 500 \* 501, 501\* 500, rotate may not improve the print quality but I don't think such kind of pdf exists. Why you need to rotate almost square presentation slides?

But if you insist the change is necessary, I can still do it. Just give me the value of `SOME_MINIMUM_ASPECT_RATIO` and `SOME_MINIMAL_DIFFERENCE`.

As @timvandermeij alluded to above, this PR unfortunately ""breaks"" in Firefox.
Given that the primary use-case for the default viewer is to be the UI for the built-in PDF viewer in Firefox, we cannot accept a PR that regresses Firefox (even if it would happen to fix something in other browsers). This is what the latest version of this PR looks like in Firefox 41:

At the moment when decision was made there was no generator that would fit our needed -- probably now there is one. Notice that we preprocess not only for Firefox but for Chromium as well.

Also we chose preprocessor vs generator for development convenience. @timvandermeij so sounds like this issue more than swapping out what's in build step, but changing entire way how development tools are used (e.g. contributors have to build pdf.js before debugging it). Personally I'm fine with that with exception that it shall not be done half-way; now who is willing to update entire infra to remove preprocessors (css, html and js, and replace them with e.g. autoprefixer and uglfier)? :
",yurydelendik,timvandermeij
6058,2015-05-28 15:00:05,"> e.g. contributors have to build pdf.js before debugging it

@yurydelendik Wouldn't that mean that something like e.g. bisecting would become _a lot_ more cumbersome (since you'd need to build at each step)? Because that is _one_ very important use-case, which the current development process makes very easy.
",Snuffleupagus,yurydelendik
6058,2015-05-28 15:53:37,"Splitting out compatibility rules to a separate would be even more burdensome than fixing the regex preprocessor, so let's skip that and give @yurydelendik's approach a shot. Thanks for the constructive discussion.

I'll drop by on IRC to discuss another possibility for the CSS at some point, that we've been evaluating for our viewer and which might also work for upstream. I'll file a specific bug report on the preprocessor and close this one.

I'm hoping to bisect the releases so that I can determine which release and platform things work on, and which don't. To do that I need to sort out a few config operations in ViewerJS which doesn't yet make it easy to specify an arbitrary release, and make sure that the ViewerJS project moves forward to the latest PDF.js release for testing.

We have https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/display/canvas.js#L1839-L1846 which _should_ take care of resetting the state already. I also tried adding explicit `save` and `restore` operators around `beginAnnotations` and `endAnnotations` at https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/annotation.js#L396-L400, but also without luck. While @THausherr's explanation is very likely, I'm unsure why these changes have no effect. The issue does appear to be not properly resetting the state before drawing annotations, but I don't know of anything more we have for canvas drawing to achieve that if the current code is not doing that.

@yurydelendik @Snuffleupagus Do you perhaps have an idea for the above? It is affecting multiple PDFs in open issues, so it would really be nice to have this resolved.

Windows 7
chrome version :-  41 : not working
mozilla version :- 35 : working. 

Ubuntu 14.04 
chrome version :- 41 : not working
mozilla version :- 37 : working.

I am attaching a screenshot which shows the working and non working output on both the machines. The application that I am building is mainly used on chrome so it would be really helpful if I can get a way around on chrome for this. Sorry again to not mention these details before.

To correctly handle various kinds of strange PDF data found in the wild, the code-base thus contain a fair number of heuristics to try and account for that.
Based on a quick look at a couple of PDF files with Type3 fonts, what I was suggesting is simply to look into using a few heuristics to avoid unnecessary regressions (e.g. only use the `FontBBox` data when `textState.fontSize === 1 && textState.fontMatrix !== FONT_IDENTITY_MATRIX`).

I tried following the firefox_build instructions you gave me.  As I'm using my Ubuntu Linux(13.0), I went over here. 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Simple_Firefox_build/Linux_and_MacOS_build_preparation.

I had trouble getting the system boostrapping to work, thus I did a number of troubleshooting steps till I reached this line.

`sudo apt-get install zip unzip mercurial g++ make autoconf2.13 yasm libgtk2.0-dev libglib2.0-dev libdbus-1-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libasound2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libiw-dev libxt-dev mesa-common-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev libpulse-dev m4 flex ccache`

That failed as it saying something about Connection failed to one of the ubuntu linux servers http://ubuntu.mirror.uber.com.au

Then I attempted to do different commands with `sudo apt-get update` that failed to work only because of the failed connection as stated above, but because of the creepy error that stays stuck on ""Waiting for headers"".

I'll try googling for more answers tonight and see where else this may lead to.

Will keep you posted.

I spent some time on this.  With not much better luck.

I even contacted the main author of the bootstrapping site.  

He tried assisting me in resolving this nagging issue.  But none of us were successful in doing so.

I'm feeling there's little much we can do as we're both clueless how this happens.

I fear I may have to call it quits on this one unfortunately...

@brendandahl Could you review this PR?

The code change is relatively small, you just need to make sure that I did not introduce regressions. Build PDF.js and run the following tests

Test 1
1. Open http://kniel.de/download/96141656.02.pdf
2. Click on the print button to generate a print preview in Chrome and/or print to a PDF file.
3. Verify that two pages are previewed without blank pages, and without cut-off (A4 size).

Test 2
1. Open https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7246095/example_RTL.pdf
2. Repeat step 2-3 of test 1 (expect 5 pages).

Test 3
1. Open the tracemonkey paper (not A4, probably US letter?)
2. Repeat step 2-3 of test 1 (expect 14 pages).

One way to improve the printing experience _might_ be to not actually use the canvas back-end, but use SVG instead. Unfortunately the SVG back-end isn't yet feature complete, and I don't think anyone is currently working on it, but the [SVG viewer lives here](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/examples/svgviewer).

Steps to verify:
1. Load extension: `node make chromium` and `chromium --user-data-dir=/tmp/whatever --load-extension=build/chromium`
2. Visit a page that links to a PDF where the referrer will be sent (e.g. https -> http pdf = no referrer).
   For example, https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=file%3Apdf+bitcoin.
3. Open chrome://net-internals/#events
4. Click on the link to the PDF from step 2.
5. Go back to chrome://net-internals/#events, click on the URL_REQUEST for the PDF (type ""pdf"" in the imput box to filter the displayed requests) and make sure that the Referer header has been added.
6. Refresh the PDF viewer and verify that the referer header is still added (using the same method as step 5).

- <sub>Some text editors have a (default) setting to remove all trailing spaces when saving a file.</sub>
- <sub>This will remove the _required_ trailing spaces in the `/xref` section of the file. (The standard requires that each line of the `xref` describing the byte offset of a PDF object MUST be exactly 20 Bytes long (including the EOL marker).

That's right -- but it also is true the other way round  ;-)

If you want users who report bugs and make the reports meaningful, you should also lower the bars and not ask them to jump through ""hoops""!

What do you think about a website which in today's times...
1. ...invites and receives bug reports, but
2. ...at the same time directs its (bug report) contributors to another website to submit their example files and proof documents to, then come back here and somewhere supply the URL to the resource?!?

What makes it much worse: 
1. This is supposed to be an _Open Source_ project.
2. You direct me to _proprietary_, _private_ hosting services.
3. This web page does not advice about how a bug submitter is supposed supply sample documents. I had to ask specifically. _(Thanks to you that you responded!)_

Time permitting I might look into creating a http://www.nuget.org/ package for this to make installing and upgrading Pdf.Js easier for the .net / asp.net world (didn't see anything out there).

@timvandermeij Since you (basically) revert one of the code changes from PR #5136, have you gone through all those files to ensure that this patch won't regress any of them (our test coverage is probably not perfect).
I've looked at most of those, and everything still appears to work, but I'd like you to reassurance me that you've looked at them too before I'm comfortable with merging this :-)

1. I'd like feedback on the general structure, and the file/class dependencies, that these patches introduces from @yurydelendik before we land this.
2. Also, I'd appreciate if this didn't land _just_ before we sync PDF.js with `mozilla-central`, which is usually done during the week before a Firefox branch point (see [Future branch dates](https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar#Future_branch_dates)). This is a big refactoring, and if there are any regressions I prefer not having to uplift fixes to the `aurora` branch.

I guess that by the same reasoning, we should move `defaultZoomValue` up.

I've noticed that we're using `var self = this;` in various places, where `this` is just the singletion `PDFViewerApplication`. To make it easier to search for the declarations and uses of certain properties, shouldn't we get rid of `self.foo` and use `PDFViewerApplication.foo` directly?

5669,2015-01-27 07:46:02," @CodingFabian Before I committed this fix, I have tested similar code to avoid the branching in the `j + x < width` branching in the loop, but the performance gain was below 1 or 2% for ~15 additional lines of code. But I preferred simplicity/readability over the marginal speed gain. And don't confuse `|` with `||`: you can't continue early if contextLabel is != 0 :-]

The option is disabled by default.

I was thinking of logic like ""Upon load, if the preference is set, reset `history.state`"". This pref will not affect in-page navigation (i.e. navigation without unloading the viewer). If the user navigates away from the viewer, then goes back, the viewer will show the top of the document.

- I've debugged this issue, and it is not specific to the Chrome extension. It is caused by the fact that the history's state is preserved when the page is reloaded. The page size, etc. are persisted in `history.state` across reloads.

5586,2015-01-05 08:06:57,"@Snuffleupagus You're right, good point. It seems like this cannot be fixed in pure CSS, because the `display` property does not support `transition`. Since there's no trivial fix to this, I removed the commit again.

So I see three possibilities for this change:
1. Reject the idea
2. It might be possible to fix the transition with JavaScript and a timer (less elegant. I'd open a separate PR)
3. Somebody has a more elegant idea.

Reasons for 1: It's only relevant in edge cases, where documents have thousands of pages and thumbs are off. And performance issues are mostly resolved already in this PR. Solution 2 is kinda hacky.

Reasons for 2: A slimmer DOM tree is always welcome, and removing thousands of DOM elements from the layout are definitely noticeable in the UI responsiveness for large documents. Also saves some memory (1KB / page).

Any opinions?

5579,2015-03-06 14:44:24,"@jazzy-em Awesome, that definitely fixed the wasteful array. 

I really hate to be a nit, but it's still a bit confusing to me. Take a look at my changes below. They remove the `matchesLength` array altogether, which was just being used as a temp variable. Also, IMHO, I think the logic after `addMatches` is a bit simpler.  I also added a few comments. Finally, I didn't make this change, but you may want to consider changing the name of the `clearMatches` function. It isn't really clearing the matches, it's sorting and then intellegitently converting `matchesWithLength` into `matches` and `matchesLength`. Maybe it should be called `convertLengthMatches` or something.

Again, I'm really sorry for being a nit here. I am already using this PR, and I want to get it into master as much as you.

-Take the PDF given with PDF.js (compressed.tracemonkey-pldi-09.pdf)
-When you search the words ""dynamic"",""dy"",""na"" and ""mic"" the text layer is deteriorated and the resulted div is like :

<div....
< span class=""highlight selected"">Dynamic< /span>
""namic""
< span class=""highlight"">na< /span>
< span class=""highlight"">mic< /span>
</div>

You can see a blank highlighted word after the word Dynamic corrsponding to ""na"" and ""mic"".
Long story short if you search words contained in another one, some spans are uselessly created.

I'm actually trying to resolve this bug, if I found something I will let you know.

@mainseq: in order to search by term and phrase at the same time i recommend to download the last version of @jazzy-em code and then change in pdf_find_controller.js the line:

var queryArray = query.split(DIVIDER_TERMS);

to:

var queryArray = query.match(/(""[^""]+"")|\S+/g), i = queryArray.length;
        while(i--){
            queryArray[i] = queryArray[i].replace(/""/g,"""");
        }

then you will be able to search for: windows linux ""operating system"" on the input search box, the Phrase check must be un checked.

However, as is, this patch is changing the default find behaviour in PDF.js:
**STR**
1. Open the preview, http://107.21.233.14:8877/5b9fd62b585f13a/web/viewer.html.
2. Open the find bar, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>.
3. Enter `dynamic languages` as the search term.

**AR:**
Either `dynamic` _or_ `languages` are found and highlighted.

**ER:**
Only `dynamic languages` is found, since this is the current behaviour in PDF.js. Compare this patch with the current master: http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html.

---

Even if the behaviour of the  `#search` hash parameter is to treat the input as a word list, according to http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_open_parameters.pdf#page=7, I'm not sure why that should _also_ affect the default find functionality in PDF.js!?

Wouldn't it make more sense to keep the current behaviour for the PDF.js find bar/Firefox find&nbsp;integration? E.g. by instead setting `phraseSearch: true,` in `web web/pdf_find_bar.js` and `web/firefoxcom.js`?

5559,2015-03-04 12:36:17,"@nschloe I would _very strongly_ advice against doing that, since that will have a number of (most likely) unwanted side-effects.
Please look through the code in [pdf_viewer.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/pdf_viewer.js), try searching for e.g. `.presentationModeState`, and you will see that there's quite a bit of special handling of the `FULLSCREEN` case.

I don't think that we should expose two _slightly_ different ""width"" zoom options in the standard viewer, which is why I personally don't think the proposed PR is a good idea in its current form. (Also, in the standard viewer, using `full-width` as implemented in that PR would cause a horizontal scrollbar to be displayed.)
Unfortunately the review times have been a bit long recently, so I don't think the developers have had time to look at it (and provide feedback) yet.

To add a `full-width` option, a very simple solution would be to modify `pdf_viewer.js` e.g. like this:

![padding](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/181628/6505450/adfcc0bc-c342-11e4-90dc-5c5b423cd727.png)

If I understand correctly, one problem is that `pdf_viewer` is hardcoded to appear with a border-shadow, requiring the extra padding. Would it be possible to remove this requirement? I could live with _anything_  that makes better use the precious screen real estate.

To clarify ... Selection appears to be dependent on both the padding **AND** the order of the text in a document. While my change creates padding that is order independent, it does not re-order the DOM elements, so it will not result in a nice flow.
",speedplane,mitar
5545,2014-12-16 20:18:17,"@mitar We can pretty easily re-order the text flow according to some metric, but I'm not sure what that metric would actually be. Take a look at the following image below. Assuming we were able to re-order the fragments any way we wanted, how would we do it? If you can think up an algorithm or heuristic, I can give it a try.

",speedplane,timvandermeij
5545,2014-12-17 06:00:49,"@mitar I tried that example. The reason selection is messed up is because everything above the title is a header, and it occurs later on in the PDF despite being on top of the title. On the one hand, Adobe does the same thing we do now, so if we're good as Adobe, then we're arguably good enough. On the other hand, screw that.

I have a potential solution for this floating in my head, but it will take another pass at all of the elements, possibly another N^2 pass. I'm not sure it's worthwhile.

Regarding fixing the N^2 issue, that too is possible.  We're basically performing a nearest neighbor search, and there are a [variety of algorithms that are less than N^2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search) to do that. Implementing those is another story however.

We're doing nearest neighbor searches right now, which can easily be O(N*logN) if a quadtree datastructure is used.

Also, almost all column text PDFs, unless outputted by a nice tool like Latex have an improperly arranged stream. To be used on [my site](www.docketalarm.com), I would like pdf.js to handle the long tail of PDF documents. I think a robust solution like this may be necessary.

5545,2014-12-26 13:25:34,"@Hengjie Thanks! This solution should still work for RTL PDFs. What is important is that the text elements' padding make the elements adjacent to eachother. Whether it's padding left or right won't matter.

With that said, because we only add right padding, there will be no padding to the left of the left-most PDF objects.  Accordingly, if you drag your mouse from the top-right of the screen to the bottom left, you won't be in any padded space, and selection will revert to the original behavior.  You can see this in [the tracemonkey example](http://107.21.233.14:8877/a6b9271a896b3eb/web/viewer.html) by starting in the top right, and then dragging to the area to the left of the authors' names.

",speedplane,Hengjie
5545,2014-12-28 22:40:53,"@Hengjie Okay done. We now give objects left and top padding as necessary. We also highlight whitespace.  

I understand your point regarding automatically switching the ""dominant"" padding, but that adds a big layer of complexity (especially for documents with  RTL and LTR languages on the same line) and only adds a very subtle UX improvement.

Also, in the PDF you gave as an example, there's a big diagonal watermark that does not play very nicely with text selection. Angled text selection will be very difficult to implement nicely, especially if there are different texts with different angles. I would say it's outside the scope of this pull request.

On a UX note however, I have been thinking about how we handle selecting whitespace. It appears that in Chrome and Adobe Reader, whitespace is **not** highlighted when it occurs on a line alone. Notice the space above and below the _v._ in the three images below.  However, when there is text on a line, it is highlighted. Do we want to do the same thing?

",speedplane,Snuffleupagus
5545,2015-01-06 23:05:51,"@timvandermeij It looks like Adobe Reader does lose space when copying text. Notice that when copying, `Petitioner,` is directly on top of `v.` without an extra line. I don't think that's so bad. Copy-Paste should not necessarily copy formatting, it should copy the text as it flows through the page.

5545,2015-01-11 22:53:00,"Fixed all of the bugs. There were a few. 

One was introduced by my change in 5b5e0bb. Although that change did fix certain scenarios, it broke many more. The current approach seems more conservative as it is less likely that one text area will mess up another.

Another bug was due to `textScale` not being properly applied  to `paddingRight`.

The error message that was displayed (`failed quadtree bounds check`) is harmless and was silenced. If an item is out of bounds, it will not be displayed and we do not need to consider it in our text layout analysis.

I added the bug fix @Hengjie described, but did so without adding the field `layoutEvaluated` (why is that necessary?).
",speedplane,Hengjie
5545,2015-01-12 01:55:41,"@Hengjie But it looks like `layoutEvaluated` is added for each element. Wouldn't it only need one variable? Why wouldn't the `return` like I used work?

5545,2015-03-03 18:04:11,"@benbro This PR will not fix every text selection issue, in particular where text is not lined up nicely on horizontal lines or where elements are overlapping.  However, it does work for the general cases, and it will never be worse than the old approach.

I took a look at the RTL example. I agree that it is not ideal, but I don't think it has anything to do with this PR. For example, the strange text selection artifacts shown on page six in the image below are present in both the standard viewer and the one with this PR, so it isn't a regression. Also, I do not think these RTL text selection artifacts have anything to do with spacing between elements, which is what my PR addresses.

5545,2015-03-09 22:33:59,"Yes, finding the larger bounding box is hairy math, but is not overly complex procedurually. @mitar do you handle the case where the entire page is rotated (not just the element within the page)?
",speedplane,mitar
5545,2015-03-10 15:36:47,"@yurydelendik We cannot handle those situations at all. The method that we are using to handle better text selection is by adding padding to each element, which will extend the left/right/top/bottom of each element until it runs into another element. If an object is rotated on a non-right angle, then no matter what padding you give it, there will always either be un-padded space between it and its nearest element or padding will overlap another element.

It may be possible to handle non-right angles, possibly using the `polygon` field, but that's asking for trouble.
",speedplane,yurydelendik
5545,2015-03-11 04:41:46,"@mitar The reason I am concerned about doing dynamic padding, is that it seems like you will need to do an operation with `O(# of PDF page elements)` complexity every time you move your mouse. Plus, you have to change the DOM model as the mouse is moving. Wouldn't something like that introduce lag?
",speedplane,mitar

I don't want to hijack this thread too much, but for my specific use-case, I need the coordinates so I can later draw the highlights / annotations onto an actual PDF file itself later.  I will experiment with that site some more and see if I can glean their approach better.

I'm currently working on a workaround to try and subtract the padding out of the results of the getClientRects results, with mixed results.

I believe there was a different approach you (@mitar) took for your site with dynamic padding.  Do you know whether it would suffer the same issue.  My thought is it wouldn't unless the mouse was still over the last text block when getting the coordinates...

5490,2016-04-16 12:29:58,"@camitz , I'm curious.  How or why did yurydelendik's Feb 8 code ""work for [you]""?  I am asking because it references //mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/build/pdf.js, and I wouldn't generally view that as a cdn.  And, it also isn't referencing a versioned copy of pdf.js

@yurydelendik (or whomever is appropriate) -  can this issue please be reopened until versioned and minified copies of pdf.js are definitely available on at least one reputable cdn?  This issue started with a reference to cdnjs, and as per their [website](https://cdnjs.com/about), they now have a preferred way to ""Request a lib"" via a [GitHub issue template](https://github.com/cdnjs/cdnjs/issues/new?title=%5BRequest%5D Add _library_name_ &body=**Library name%3A** %0A**Git repository url%3A**%0A**npm package url%28optional%29%3A** %0A**License%28s%29%3A**%0A**Official homepage%3A**%0A**Wanna say something? Leave message here%3A**%0A%0A=====================%0ANotes from cdnjs maintainer%3A%0APlease read the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md document first.%0A%0AYou are welcome to add a library via sending pull request%2C%0Ait%27ll be faster then just opening a request issue%2C%0Aand please don%27t forget to read the guidelines for contributing%2C thanks!!) for requesting that PDF.js is added to cdnjs.  Would a PDF.js project leader please make such a request?  (I would do it myself but I don't know whether the PDF.js project would want cdnjs to use pdf.js or pdfjs-dist.  Also, it would probably be best if the PDF.js project itself created a minified version of its code that goes to cdnjs.)

I think that camitz's use case that he shared on Dec 30 is very good and still applicable for lots of people (including myself).  Like camitz, I would like to minimize the amount of trust that my users have to put in me, and using copies of libraries that are on a CDN definitely helps with that.

Anyway the bug still occurs on the following file:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/7xgxjmknu4by3gb/cabs_4tiles_lrcp_noplm_noedgetiles_puniform.jp2?dl=0

I think that @plroit's solution is good for a situations in which the codeblock is larger than the precinct. If the codeblocks are smaller I still get the exception.
The indication for this is that JPX is executed well for a similar file with only 4 decomposition levels (instead of the 5 in the file above). When debugging I found out that with 5 levels, level 5 codeblocks are smaller than its precincts.

I tried to change @plroit's calculation of cblkGroupWidth and cblkGroupHeight to 1 << dimensions.xcb_ and 1 << dimensions.ycb_ but it doesn't work. I'm still trying to work on it.

This works well in the addon given the code in `PdfStreamConverter.jsm`, but not in the generic viewer (where it _is_ a regression, in my opinion).
@yurydelendik Any objection against me re-purposing this PR to just fix the generic viewer, and then we can explore your enumeration idea in a followup if we want to?

5332,2015-03-11 11:59:15,"@yurydelendik, you'd like to keep current master version of ChunkedStream and move code from this PR into ChunkedFragmentedStream and switch between those two implementations based on PDF size (ALLOCATE_NO_CHUNKS) and maybe additional PDFJS setting? Is that correct?

Here is a bit more info on what is happening in this PR- ChunkedStream supports two different allocation modes (fragmented and continuous, fragmented being what is PR is all about ) and two different chunk loading modes (chunks and continuous). Chunks offsets and sizes are always multiplies of chunk size (except the last chunk) while continuous mode has no such restrictions. 
ChunkedStream in this PR will gather continuous data into chunks and then reuse chunks loading path except for first continuous data it receives which is loaded as initialData and can be smaller than chunk size.

Method substitutions are there for performance reasons. In my performance testing this new class performs better in most cases (over all 4 combinations of modes and different PDF sizes) then the old one. Method substitution happens on the fly if all data is loaded and some checks are no longer needed and some other cases. I can look and document all the cases where it happens if it is of any help.

I don't think I can keep this level of performance without some code duplication as I cannot use methods from current master version of ChunkedStream for continuous allocation path. I could remove method substitution but performance is noticeably worse in that case.

5294,2014-09-16 12:05:58,"I came across the same problem recently (although in my case I also want to wrap `pdf.js` into its own `amd` module, but that's another story)...

@yurydelendik What's going on here is, that the `pdf.js` code is loaded from within an existing application via `ajax` request, so that one has not to embed `<script></script>` tags in the `index.html` page and require the user to load all of the (rather huge!) `pdf.js` codebase beforehand (if used or not). The `pdf.js` library code could then easily be required only when it's going to be used.

I guess it's not possible to load only the `pdf.js` file without the complementing `pdf.worker.js` file which is required from the `pdf.js` library itself? 

So, perhaps it's possible to create a huge, single file (with `node make singlefile`) and compress it via a Grunt task, or extend the `make.js` file to have a task which takes the `singlefile` build and runs the Google Closure Compiler agains it?

But, in my opinion, no matter what solution of the above is used, it feels very odd and over-complicated. It's more or less a workaround which forces you to fork/tweak/host/provide this library - not very intentional and ""user friendly"".

Is there any suggested solution or something like a guideline or ""best practice"" to embed `pdf.js` only when needed (I guess there are a dozen projects out there which have to deal with this sort of issue?)?

So on the grounds that i do not want to go through legal i'dd rather say no. 

But i'll try to see if I can produce a similar PDF without an embedded font for you to use in reference tests.

5258,2014-09-04 18:12:09,"@Snuffleupagus thanks for the tips! Is there any reason, though, not to expose them in the location bar? It's equivalent to what's happening in the JS, just not exposed in the browser UI.

I'm also only thinking post-link-click exposure--not ""as the page scrolls"" exposure.

Essentially anything that currently adds to the browsing history should look like it did in the location bar.

Thanks!

`Named Destinations` was the one I'd been expecting to update the URL, but it didn't.

However, I did some more digging and found [RFC3778 Section 3](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3778#section-3) which defines Fragment Identifiers for the `application/pdf` Media Type.

It links to an Adobe technical note, [Parameters for Opening PDF Files](http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_open_parameters.pdf). In which is a [Specifying parameters in a URL](http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_open_parameters.pdf#G4.1501531) and a list of available [parameters](http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_open_parameters.pdf#G4.1501771).

It does, however, drive off the map a bit and say that either `&` or `#` can be used for delimiters--which would make them invalid (according to [RFC3986](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986) anyhow) URLs. But disregarding that, it's a pretty fabulous map for adding these to URLs. :smile: 

Would be great to see them all added, but for now `Named Destinations` support alone (which apparently--according to the [URL Examples](﻿http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_open_parameters.pdf#G4.1500549)--can go directly after `#` or at `#nameddest=`...which is far uglier) would be fabulous!

Thanks for digging into this issue @Snuffleupagus!

5257,2014-09-03 20:16:52,"@yurydelendik Just as Rob and Fabian, my Chrome (on Mac) rendered the outline of the gray box with the white fill; which I assume is the desired box rendering.

I'm guessing that you are verifying the checkbox/form field drawing commands (or constructPath OPS.rectangle from display/canvas.js).  I will try to find the pdf.js debug technique, for determining the drawing commands output (if that's possible).

5257,2014-09-04 20:15:08,"@yurydelendik I was able to run the (Firefox on Mac) debugger (which correctly renders the above sample W9 document). Yet, the gray form box issue is occurring with Chrome (on Mac).  Can debugging be done using Chrome?

Also, I notice that my debug line numbers don't match with the line numbers that you presented (255-257) in your jsbin snippet (linked above); which I assume you cut from your debugging of the W9 document, and then inlined the Javascript code.  Here are my line numbers:
  253   rectangle   [176.212,605.6,-13,13]
  254   rectangle   [177.212,619.6,-15,-15]
  255   fill    []
So, it seems the rendering calls (eg. setFillRGBColor, or GlobalCompositeOperation) are being used differently through Chrome or Mac.  Is that a possible cause of this gray form box issue?

So, on Mac Chrome, the form fields and checkboxes are rendered using constructPath (and not rectangle).  The following sequence of commands renders a gray checkbox, then a gray form field, THEN a white form field... what?!?

5218,2015-11-10 23:15:35,"@yurydelendik Yes, I hope to work on this again soon. The goal is to split this PR into multiple smaller PRs. Actually a lot of this PR is already merged by #5585, #6273, #6239, #6232, #6214 and more listed here: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Apr+annotation

I hope to get the last bits of this PR into separate PRs soon such that we can close this one. I have set this to work in progress such that I constantly get reminded to finish this PR, and fortunately a lot has already been done by the above PRs, which are essentially self-contained parts of this PR for easier review.
",timvandermeij,yurydelendik
5214,2014-08-20 13:30:09,"while this PR only aims at specific performance improvements, all of them are covered by #5218, great work @timvandermeij - depending on when #5218 will get merged we can merge or abandon this.
I prefer to improve the new implementation, but we should also see to not let it be WIP for too long.
",CodingFabian,timvandermeij
5214,2014-12-16 18:42:31,"@CodingFabian Could you rebase this PR? Let's try to land this first as my PR requires some more work and has to be rebased anyway.
",timvandermeij,CodingFabian
5214,2014-12-19 22:15:09,"@CodingFabian Looks really good. One thing I have found: see https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/5218#discussion-diff-16565556 and http://logs.glob.uno/?c=mozilla%23pdfjs&s=20+Aug+2014&e=20+Aug+2014#c23865 for reference. For that PR we did a lot of research and found that Adobe Reader defaults back to black if the C entry is _missing_. The spec only talks about the case where the array has 0 elements, but it does not say what to do if it's missing entirely. Otherwise we regress https://pdf.yt/d/XBjrpaYuieax9D6b (also compare that one to Adobe Reader to see that it falls back to a black border). Could you update that for this PR, i.e., make a distinction between the empty array and missing array case?
",timvandermeij,CodingFabian
5214,2014-12-19 23:13:30,"thanks for bringing this up @timvandermeij - should be good now, right?

Btw, do you want me to hoist the const matrices outside of the CalRGBCS class? There would be then even less object creation but they would be global then and I don't know if it makes any difference performance wise.

What would be the best way to test the gains from this temp matrices optimization? Speed and memory wise?

I saw it mainly because I was investigating scrolling impact.

I put custom profiling code into the affected methods. Their runtime goes down from 1901ms to 1735ms - about a 10% improve. Also the ""overhead"" of the text layer divs goes down by 10% from about 300 bytes to 270 bytes per div.
before the patch I got frequent rendering dips to < 10 fps (measured using chrome canary fps counter), with the patch it stays most of the time above 10 fps. The fps metric is not as reliable, but it somehow also feels like a 10% improvement :-)

5111,2014-08-04 03:38:31,"I've worked out what changed. It's related to the way the `'.notdef'` glyph is handled in one place. Here's the old code, from src/core/fonts.js:



`charsets[glyphId]` is `'.notdef'`. `cidString` is `'\x00'` (because `'.notdef'` converted to an integer is `NaN`, and then `String.fromCharCode` called on `NaN` is `'\x00'`).
We then do `charCodeOf(0)`, which gives 0, and so we set `charCodeToGlyphId[0]`.

Now consider the new code.



`charsets[glyphId]` is `'.notdef'`, so `cid` is too. We then do `charCodeOf('.notdef')`, which gives -1, and so we set `charCodeToGlyphId[-1]`, which I guess is effectively the same as not setting anything, since the -1th element probably won't be subsequently read.

I haven't worked out why this causes different behaviour in Firefox and Chromium. But I can replicate the Chromium bug with my patch applied if I add `if (cid === '.notdef') charCode = 0` before the final assignment.

So my patch is clearly an improvement, but the handling of `'.notdef'` is still not good. One possibility is to check for a -1 return value from charCodeOf() in this loop. But there might be other misuses of `'.notdef'`... in which case fixing them in a follow-up PR might be appropriate, since it's well beyond the scope of this PR.

@yurydelendik, what do you think?

@nnethercote I think Fabian might be thinking of collecting the byte codes of `font.getByte()` in an array and then applying bytesToString() to it. This potentially saves memory as numbers should have a smaller memory footprint than 1-char strings (can you confirm this?), and `bytesToString()` is much faster than calling `String.fromCharCode()` for each byte separately.

At least in the case of #5069, bytesToString did not cause the regression, see my comment there.

I'm current working on a total rewrite of the annotation layer code, but I thought this patch was so easy that I would just post it so we have the support until/if the rewritten code lands (primarily because it fixes the mentioned open issue). I already have a small working version of the new code locally. It uses the abstraction used by PDFNet to get much more readable and extendable code. See http://www.pdftron.com/pdfnet/docs/PDFNetJava/pdftron/PDF/Annots/Text.html for example. I'm also aiming to add support for Underline etc. to the new code because the new code allows for these extensions much more easily by inheriting almost all properties from the parent class Text.

Why I'm rewriting the code:
- To use separate classes for each annotation type with the advantage of inheritance of base classes.
- To get better test coverage (at least one test file for each annotation type).
- To support for more annotation types (because this code is easily extendable).
- To get more readable code.
- To get a better insight (by comparing to the spec) of what is still unimplemented and adding TODOs for that. (I found that not all missing functionality in the current implementation is mentioned in the code, which I found quite confusing and those mentions help other contributors to fill the gaps.)

5057,2014-07-29 15:38:41,"@Rob--W Thank you for your explanations.

I created a small Qt project with just one widget being my PDFViewer (derived from QWebView). It's very basic Qt so it shouldn't be any problem with MSVC 2010. You can right click in the webview and click ""Inspect"" to see console. You will need to change the QUrl in main.cpp to match a file in your disk.

http://jcourtois.fr/files/PDFViewer_Issue5057.zip

I personnaly use Qt 5.3.1, just be sure to use Qt 5 as there was no issue in Qt 4 at the time. I embedded v1.0.473 in qrc file.

If you have any question, please ask. Thanks again.

5047,2014-10-09 02:58:05,"Hey @yurydelendik @mzgol -- your package on npm currently cannot be used with node modules (so no Browserify for the frontend). 



You want to do something like this (i'd do it differently, but respecting your way of doing it and adding minimal amt of code):



So two things:
-  need to explicitly declare `var PDFJS =`. good practice in general.
- if `module.exports` is a thing, assign `module.exports = PDFJS`.

If you're worried about putting this code in the otherwise public-facing src, then have your build bot patch it in. But most libraries out there support this.

5047,2014-10-09 12:27:11,"> I can hardly connect ...

@yurydelendik this issue, at the very top, mentions npm and browserify. This is precisely about npm, as your package does not follow standard npm practice; it's just a code dump. Note that using pdfjs with browserify _webapps_ requires that the module can be imported (`require`) as usual. If not familiar, browserify is basically ""node"" in the browser. Or at least, the module system (npm).  (( so, am not speaking of running pdf.js in node servers, only proper npm packaging ))

> I don't think it's hard to ... 

I've done all the work you need to get this to work, this solves the problem. Sorry, but I don't have time to learn how your process works. In the interest of everybody's time, I handled all the npm/browserify/etc stuff for you, since I know it well. Please handle your process, since you know it well.

It mentions Browserify in this way: ""even ones that don't use Browserify""; this issue is not about Browserify but just about having PDF.js bundle published on npm. This was already achieved and I'm using it currently.

If you want pdf.js to work with browserify, you should report a new issue.

![](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/dnno.gif)

well-- it's good the code is at least, _there_... 

I think @yurydelendik and @mzgol are just not familiar with npm and npm practices. I wish they would defer this to people that are, but that's their decision. it's their module after all.

Everyone is welcome to create a pull request to address this issue. Indeed I think none of the main developers are an expert on NPM, which is also what @yurydelendik mentions in https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/5047#issuecomment-58498796. There were requests to make the built version of PDF.js available on Bower and NPM, so that has been done. If there are things to improve there, we can certainly use help with that from the NPM/Bower community. Anyone can help to improve this, so it's not that we are unwilling to do so ourselves, it is just not our main priority/area of expertise.

I would say that the changes from @jbenet look easy enough to add (thank you for that!), preferably using some preprocessor directives. If we use preprocessor directives, it will only be added in the build stage, which seems to be the goal. If someone is willing to do that and create a pull request, we will certainly review it. When somebody is interested, please open a _new_ issue because commenting on a closed issue does not help to make the problem visible for other contributors.

I could not verify the 'clip' operator change, because Tracemonkey shows no difference to me (I assume that's what you meant by 'default doc'; if you meant the document loaded by default in the SVG viewer example, than I cannot verify it because the text still renders crazily for me because of that Bugzilla bug).

I have also reviewed the code again and added two small comments. Overall, this is starting to look really good.

Below a screenshot of how `extgstate.pdf` renders before and after applying this PR. You can clearly see that the rendering became worse. Any idea what's causing that?

As for the clippping, by default PDF, I meant the 'default' in SVG. (liveprogramming.pdf). Anyway, I think it's not a good example. I tried it on the PDF 32000 document, and I think the clip is still not working properly. For reference, it's Page No. 240 in that document.

4990,2014-06-24 08:22:36,"> Can you remove those changes?

Sure, there you go.

I was started looking into this class when I noticed that large documents load unnecessary long, because most data is loaded in small 64k chunks ([pdf_manager.js#L23](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/pdf_manager.js#L23)). Big chunks speed up total loading time, but increase time to display the first page. Therefore I would vote for increasing the chunk size only for background transfers, which can be accomplished by not requesting one chunk at [chunked_stream.js#L497](https://github.com/fkaelberer/pdf.js/blob/eba85e636229ed713200a892a405f7ed90c03c31/src/core/chunked_stream.js#L497), but many (8?) chunks at once.

This would be a very easy fix to speed up loading some large documents, but there are many other documents, whose chunk loading process is dominated by MissingDataExceptions when parsing the document. In this case, the fix won't help. It does't hurt either, so I think it's worth the small effort. 
@yurydelendik What do you think?
",fkaelberer,yurydelendik
4990,2014-06-24 08:45:50,"@CodingFabian In case you're worried that this PR increases the number of function calls by using `this.hasChunk()` more frequently: None of the calls is very hot, now that #4966 has landed.

4954,2014-06-16 19:23:33,"@CodingFabian Why do you need to access the options through the hash parameters to achieve that though? You could (or even should) do either:
- Change the default values in `default_preferences.js`.
- Or add `PDFJS.disableRange = true` (and others as appropriate) to e.g. the top of `viewer.js`.

This issue isn't about removing any options, rather changing how they are accessed.
Since having them available as regular hash parameters means that a website could change how the viewer works, which is really bad and that was never intended functionality.
",Snuffleupagus,CodingFabian
4954,2014-06-16 19:50:20,"@CodingFabian the api settings will stay without changes. we just need to find a way to make them changable for the users of the pdf.js generic viewer -- configuring the viewer via hash parameter is not a good idea. It might be a good idea to keep the code disabled for development and diagnostics of the issues.

From multiple users, I've heard that they expect to be able to use arrow keys/page up/down, but that it ""does not work after changing the zoom level"".

I've tried other document viewers, and most of them work as described by the OP (e.g. Okular, Adobe PDF Viewer).

People can still change the zoom to presets when they use the keyboard, because the changes are only applied after pressing Enter. And after changing the zoom level to say, ""Page Fit"", it is very likely that they just want to navigate through the PDF using the keyboard.

4923,2014-06-12 14:59:35,"@yurydelendik Yes. Further, I find the keyboard argument for zoom not very convincing, because it _is_ already difficult to reach the dropdown via zoom only (tab-tab-tab-tab-tab-[Enter]-arrow key(s)-[Enter]). If access to the dropdown is an issue, then we could put an accesskey attribute on the `<select>` tag for easy access.

I found it while i was looking into the slow canvas draw in chrome (caused by https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=170021). I have a workaround for that, but first of all it should be figured out if downscaling is actually possible. right now i assume that it is not satisfying and we should figure out a way to render the pages two two different canvas

4862,2015-08-22 19:05:43,"@Rob--W My suggestions would be 
- the ""usual"" highlight yellow color for the (borderless) rectangle (maybe this can be remove somewhere in the viewer's settings?)
- I'd let the rectangle be removable, maybe an ""X"" on the upper right corner? Since the rectangle is part of the URL, I suggest changing the URL to reflect the rectangle has been removed (""back"" button would restore it).

I don't use the Adobe Reader or the corresponding plugin, so I can't comment on how it displays the rectangle.

I'd like to add that one important usability aspect of this is having a mechanism to _create_ the highlight rectangle in the first place.  Maybe a button in the PDF.js viewer would allow the user to create a rectangle (which would also automatically update the URL with the new rectangle info)? This way one can share highlighted PDFs without needed the ability to edit the PDF or guess coordinates.

- The first version wasn't really as modular as it could/should have been. Hence I've changed it so that all overlays are no longer required to be placed in the same container. (As an added bonus, this slightly reduced the number of lines added by the PR.)
- A small change which allows an overlay to also force close itself. This was done to ensure a consistent behaviour, and also to prevent any future issues.
- Add/remove the `keydown` event listener when opening/closing overlays, since always having an event listener attached to the window seems unnecessary.
- Address the review comments from the previous version.

4819,2014-09-16 11:33:19,"What if I want to get the `pdfjs` library from my own server where the location of the file could differ dependent on the server where it's installed? If I write absolute paths the installed instances are not maintainable anymore. Also, this would not allow to deal with ""intranet"" applications which don't have access to the internet.

Is there any other solution that is covering all the edge cases @timvandermeij ?
",herom,timvandermeij
4819,2014-09-16 13:35:25,"@yurydelendik I could think of several edge cases which are not covered (of course they are children of my thoughts/needs but I think they are not too special).

**Case 1:**
Let's assume you have a web application which needs `pdf.js` just in certain cases when a PDF should be shown to the user. These cases are not fulfilled for more than 30% of the users so you don't want to deliver the library upfront and instead, load it when necessary.

To sum it up: _Load the library asynchronously in existing code._

**Case 2:**
(1) Let's assume you have implemented the web application from case 1  and need to install it on several servers. Not all of the servers have access to the internet - instead they are strictly tied to the customers ""intranet"" and therefore cannot load the library from `pdf.js`s github.io location.

(2) Let's assume you have implemented the web application from case 1  and you cannot/will not rely on the uptime/availability of github.io (be it through some odd requirement or the fact that the application should only drop out when its own server breaks down), so you want to load the library from your own location.

To sum it up: _Load the library asynchronoulsy from your own location into existing code._

**Case 3:**
Let's assume you have implemented the web application from case 2 with a ""fancy"" new framework which doesn't use globals/global namespace and you don't want to mess it up.

To sum it up: _Load the library into the web application as a ""true"" module which doesn't bloat into the global namespace._
",herom,yurydelendik
4819,2014-09-16 15:11:48,"@yurydelendik I see your point - sorry for that, I just supposed that I can explain myself clearly enough to get/discuss a ""best practice"" or so to wrap `pdf.js` into an `amd` or whatever module so that it can be injected into any ""modern"" web application (be it Ember.js, Angular, Backbone, etc.). So, it's not about me using Ember.js and ES6 modules and a particular style at all (in my opinion) but about a common ""problem"" to get an `amd` module instead of a global object...

As English is not my mothertongue I guess I'm a bit limited in expressing myself in the right way so I can explain a common issue. I'll try and raise a new issue and I hope I can give enough infromation to be a valid work item :smiley:

If I may follow up your suggestion on not to use the `singlefile` in short, why do I have to run the minifier task which gives me two files where I don't know if the `compatibility.js` file is really delivered with and hand the task of requiring/lazy loading the `pdf.worker.js` over to `pdf.js`? (I know this is out of scope again, just curious)

4816,2014-05-20 13:42:12,"@yurydelendik Yes. My fullscreen button is part of the toolbar in the viewer itself (which is a necessity for a copy-paste embed), so it is always called from within the iframe itself. I imagine most ""custom full-screen"" usecases would be like that. An appropriate solution would be to just make the `fullscreenchange` event only do something when it was triggered by PresentationMode.

@AprilMorone I'm not certain that it's an identical version, but the `presentation_mode.js` that I just linked has the same problem as my build. I am assuming that is an up-to-date build.

My personal opinion is that it's a very minor feature which I doubt many people will need/discover, and it requires quite a lot of code, so I would say that we leave this and close the original issue as won't-fix.

That's just my opinion though; I'm curious to know what you think. I think it's important to make a decision so PRs don't stay open for too long.

I always had the browser extension in mind, where all data is available on disk, so additional file accesses don't hurt. But if the file is loaded via the viewer, then differential compression is _always worse_ than regular storage.

@yurydelendik: Is it a good idea to use differentially packed cmaps for the extension, and normally packed cmaps for the viewer? The decompression code would be the same, only the cmap files would be packed differently.

> Try installing, starting, Opera 21 ( or 22 ) with a fresh profile and re-installing the PDF Viewer extension. Does that work ?

No it doesn't.

> However, I later tried a fresh install of Opera 22.0.1471.8, and the buttons were missing from the very beginning.

When I say a fresh install, I really mean a _fresh everything_ install — removed everything with AppCleaner.

> I think you should file an issue on the PDF extension or on the Desktop Browser itself. 

Good point. In fact, I reported the bug here because ""visit extension's website"" directs to https://github.com/operasoftware/pdf.js/issues?state=open. And I've been told that I should report in the Mozilla repo instead of the Opera repo.
",zmwangx,p01

Since we cannot do anything about this other than the tips that @p01 gave (you can also try http://en.kioskea.net/faq/10081-reset-opera-to-default-settings to clear the Opera profile), I'm closing this as invalid for now unless it turns out to have something to do with PDF.js, which at the moment does not seem to be the case.

Note: An optimization technique for Firefox is not necessarily 1:1 appicable to Chrome and vice versa.

You custom build process process can do that. But I would recommend to load PDFJS as a separate module (see #4654), or I'm missing something?

I know that PDF.js is not designed for node.js and that's why we are not trying to publish that as a node.js.

",timvandermeij,Hengjie
4629,2014-06-18 14:44:48,"My idea was to start with this from scratch. I see three main areas to be improved:
- performance
- matching of the text layer and the canvas text
- UX, e.g. less flickering on selecting bigger text blocks

The performance issues are mainly caused by to expensive text layers in terms of DOM. Basically for some types of PDFs each single character ends up in its own composite layer (in its own scaled absolute positioned element). This makes e.g. scrolling of these documents very slow.

There are IMO two main issues to improve matching of the text, ensure that really the correct font family gets selected (the PDFs are often lying about the font family, i did some tests with xor'ing the target font with all main font families, that turnes out to work pretty well). The other issue is word spacing. Currently the word spacing is not exposed to the text layer (there is some code which tries to address that with inserting spaces between text fragments if the white space is bigger than an according white space, but that covers only limited set of PDFs, e.g. not the ones which define word spacing instead). Exposing it makes adjustments in the text layer a bit more complicated, but it should IMO be possible. @Hengjie code mainly tries to improve the text matching.

UX issue, like flickering while selecting whole text blocks, are caused by the current DOM structure, e.g. an elemnt of the text layer contains at most only a single line.

This PR here addresses all issues to some extend. Most of the changes are in the text layer. But i think it would make more sense to move most of that code down to buildTextGeometry, basically move that call to it's own class and add to the according geometry objects also line numbers and ideally text block numbers. There are four PS instructions which call buildTextGeometry to create text geometry objects,  OPS.showSpacedText, OPS.showText, OPS.nextLineShowText, OPS.nextLineSetSpacingShowText. Right now only OPS.showSpacedText accumulates text fragments in a geometry object, but at least OPS.showText should do that too (this is the main reason for the performance issues).

But the main issue is that i don't really have time anymore to work on this. I can probably update this PR here to the newest mainline, but i have no time to do the changes which i have had in mind. Perhaps discuss with @yurydelendik if that makes sense or if you would like to restart from scratch with these improvements?

4629,2014-06-20 17:45:05,"@mitar That appears to work much smoother indeed, but I do notice that, while text selection is working, right-click and Copy does not work. Right-clicking undoes the selection and displays the regular context menu without Copy option.

@chriskr do you know where the word spacing information is? How can I extract it? The way I'm doing it right now is inferring that information based on the letter's absolute positions and the maximum char width of the font. It's a hacky solution and I'd prefer to remove all of that interpolation code.

The biggest problem I have with the code is that it completely breaks search highlighting. I'm unsure how to fix it and will probably need help as I'm unfamiliar with the rest of the PDF.js code.

I've also done a lot of work in fixing up selecting text and how dragging a pixel beyond the text will result in all text being selected.

I'm not familiar with the evaluator.js but is it run in the worker?

Edit: Looks like it's from worker.

A note about the flickering, the issue with ordering is that sometimes PDFs would order it different and we'd have to reorder it. It also depends on the language, such ltr or rtl text.

I hacked up some code that's running in production that does the coalescing and fix flickering to an extent at https://web.notablepdf.com that you guys can try out. It's not perfect, really just hacky and not in a state that I think is PR-able. For eg, search highlighting depends on rangy-highlighter to work.

4629,2014-08-13 14:52:48,"> Guys, what do you think about doing the coalescing in getTextContent() in evaluator.js instead?

@Hengjie yes, that's the indented location for that. We already running some heuristics there to minimize amount of divs.
",yurydelendik,Hengjie
4629,2014-11-10 18:01:06,"@Hengjie was the last one working on this if I am correct.
",timvandermeij,Hengjie
4629,2014-12-25 02:53:12,"I've started working on this again and have coalescing code working in the worker's `evaluator.js`. I'm currently only coalescing words, but eventually want to coalesce to sentences and PR it. Longer term, the idea is to make it into a single div, so that we're coalescing paragraphs and columns together into a to reduce selection flickering further.

The performance of doing this is far better than @chriskr's approach because it doesn't rely on the DOM to get positioning information.
",Hengjie,chriskr
4629,2015-01-03 10:44:09,"@chriskr re `font_metrics.js`, the ascent seems to become 0 when zoom drops below 50% for the `compressed.tracemonkey-pldi-09.pdf`. The reason why is because the `fontHeight` is so small that `getFirstNoneWhitePixelTop()`'s xy iterations aren't granular enough. I haven't looked further than that, but I'd really prefer to use your font_metrics for the coalescing code I'm writing. Is there a solution to this problem?

Right now, I just fallback to the original PDF.js method in `text_layer_builder.js`'s `appendText()`. See below:

You may not be able to see all that much difference because performance issue is mainly in Qt Webkit environment.

From what I've observed, some pages have extremely large size of operator list and when past implementation of pdf.js attempted to handle the entire list in one go the js engine slowed down. After the patch, it no longer slows down that much.

In Qt Webkit environment it used to take 30~50 minutes to finish rendering page 8 of the document above, but now it takes about 4~5 minutes - something is seriously wrong there :(

@yurydelendik Is this approximately what you had in mind: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/compare/master...Snuffleupagus:combine-setTextMatrix? If so, I'll add a test-case and submit a PR.

4398,2014-03-11 18:34:37,"@yurydelendik I've uploaded two very similar PDFs:
- https://www.dropbox.com/s/smrktrzwrjjh6u4/funky.pdf  (has rendering issue; the ""a"" are missing)
- https://www.dropbox.com/s/kp3uylz4fku9ocs/less_funky.pdf (I just added a cell with the letter ""x"" in it and you'll see all the ""a"" are showing)

Background: this was originally an Excel file that was converted to PDF by Aspose.
- Bug shows up in Mac Preview.app in Mavericks PRIOR to 10.9.2 (it's now fixed)
- Bug shows up if I open the file directly with Firefox
- Bug does not show up with Chrome PDF viewer
- Bug does not show up in Acrobat

So it seems there's a fairly widespread rendering issue in clients, not only in PDF.JS

Does the last character need to be aligned to 32bit boundary in pdf? I get confused about it.

I check that all tables are long-aligned.  The problem is that the last entry of loca table is long-aligned,  but glyf table is not padded with zeros correspondingly。That makes  the last entry of loca table  exceed the glyf table length. Now I regenerate the pdf with padding zeros in glyf table. It is ok in Adobe Reader, but in firefox, none charactor can be see. My new generated pdf : https://www.dropbox.com/s/ulz1ovjtmn37y74/funky.pdf . Any advice?

Mobile Safari use some clever technique so that not the whole page has to reside in memory at any given time, only a portion of it.

4348,2014-02-27 22:09:20,"@bthorben Travis is still complaining somewhat. Here are some tips to get your PRs to be ready for review sooner:
1. Lint yourself: use `node make lint` in a terminal to run linting locally. This will allow you to catch all warnings so Travis doesn't have to anymore.
2. Squash your commits. See https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Squashing-Commits on how to do this easily. This would make one commit out of the five commits currently in this PR.

This would also be a good addition for https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Style-Guide ;) 
I will just suggest something ...

4318,2014-02-27 20:06:44,"Actually, it seems to me like acrobat and preview have different print outputs for interactiveAnnotations.pdf.
As of now, links are displayed and printed the same way everywhere (PR, acrobat and preview). The difference is on text annotations.
- acrobat: no text annotation's icon is printed
- preview: the yellow and blue ones ares printed but not the ""bulb""
- pdf.js (before PR - only HTML icons): no icon is printed
- pdf.js (after PR - mix of /AP's and HTML icons): all three icons are printed, but only the first time. If you print more than once, the output becomes the same as in acrobat. I will look into that.

The difference between the ""bulb"" and the two other annotations is their /F flags (they all have an /AP):
- bulb: 728 (NoZoom, NoRotate, ReadOnly, Locked)
- other: 28 (<b>Print</b>, NoZoom, Norotate)

So technically, it seems that preview is the ""most right"" in its interpretation of the PDF.

I propose that we use the 'Print' bit as well to determine whether an annotation's appearance should be printed or not. 
The other option is to ignore the flags and not print any annotation (like acrobat seems to do, at least for text annotations, also the current version of pdf.js).

@yurydelendik asked for what I understand would be a global ""show/hide annotations"" switch. Is it ok if I do that in a follow-up PR?

Nice findings. Yes, we shall use print flags during rendering.

> @yurydelendik asked for what I understand would be a global ""show/hide annotations"" switch. Is it ok if I do that in a follow-up PR?

Based on your finding above, have a rendering intent flag will be sufficient, e.g. to be passed via renderingContext to render() method https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/page_view.js#L589 and then to the worker via ""RenderPageRequest"". But that would be a bigger effort. Let us know if you want to add that to this pull request.

Better, but they are still a bit larger than the current size. (And also when compared to Adobe Reader.)
If needed, I can attach screen-shots.

**Edit:** It appears that the issue with the patch is that you now enforce a minimum size for link annotations, which we currently don't, and this is causing the border size issues.

Hence I do not think that we should make it possible to specify the `title` using a hash parameter!

Especially considering that it would be non-standard (in the context of http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_open_parameters.pdf), and compared to the `Content-Disposition` approach in PR #7554, it really doesn't add much value.

I think it would be good for the author of that change to support his change, or for it to be reverted.

I really just went through the work of finding/identifying something that I think was clearly a bad change.  But I think it's been made clear to me that this sort of work is not appreciated in your software organization.  If it is used by so many people these days, maybe you should care a bit about existing code quality, but that is very much not my problem.  Best of luck.

From the description of the issue, I'm slightly worried that this might have been caused by #4074. When writing that patch, getting switching to/from presentation mode to work in different browsers was a real pain. So it's entirely possible that this issue is a regression.

@Rob--W Can you please test the last commit https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/commit/d6ed4f263182d4cc7097245bcbb1bd54f03f93c0, before #4074 was merged, to see if this issue is present there as well?

> I noticed that sometimes it takes dimensions of the different page instead of current.

4228,2014-01-30 22:27:52,"@timvandermeij If the Web worker has not responded in, say, 10 seconds, then we can assume that the worker cannot be started. We can probably choose a lower value, but not too low (at least not for the web version to account for network latency).
",Rob--W,timvandermeij
4228,2015-09-23 22:32:19,"@timvandermeij This is a browser limitation, but we can cope with it.

We could try to detect when we've reached the global worker limit, and then re-use worker threads elsewhere. An example of such an implementation is to create two workers; `SharedWorker` and `Worker`. The `Worker` instance is usually used for rendering. The `SharedWorker` is used as a fallback: When the Worker limit has been reached, then creating another `Worker` will fail, but the `SharedWorker` can then be used to handle the other PDFs.
Another way is to notify other subscribers of the SharedWorker events of the worker creation failure, so that another tab can terminate their (idle) worker to regain the ability to launch new workers.

The first requires that we support multiple documents per worker, i.e. that #5992 gets fixed. The second (terminating (idle) workers) requires that we can deal with loosing the worker, e.g. the ability to interrupt rendering, moving ownership of the PDF data buffer to the main thread prior worker termination, and (re)activating workers to process the PDF data at some arbitrary PDF object).
",Rob--W,timvandermeij
4228,2015-11-25 00:04:09,"@timvandermeij How does #6571 fix this bug? It allows PDF.js to use a single worker in a tab controlled by a single page, but this bug is about multiple tabs. Unless SharedWorkers are used, the workers are not shared across tabs, and after 20 tabs, this bug shows up.

Re-opening. If you think that the bug has really been fixed, please point out the mistake in my reasoning.

Canary is bleeding-edge , and dev is only slightly behind (currently 1964 and 1967 - see https://omahaproxy.appspot.com/).

That having said, I don't see anything in the bug that suggests that the bug has been fixed besides the Fixed label...

The API owner of streamsPrivate has not responded yet.

I've started to develop and submit generic extension features to Chromium that makes this permission unnecessary.
- FTP support: https://codereview.chromium.org/166793003/ (upstream, Chromium 35)
- Access to response body: http://crbug.com/104058 (development in progress)
- Extension-initiated redirects after receiving headers: https://codereview.chromium.org/154473002/ (in progress)

(PDFs in POST responses are relatively rare, FTP requests are also rare, but much more common than PDFs in POST responses, so the impact of not having access to streamsPrivate is low)

I will remove the use of streamsPrivate in PDF.js when Chromium and Opera includes the desired features.

4085,2014-01-07 22:14:37,"@yurydelendik Yes, but moving the event listener creation to the secondary toolbar file is both consistent with all other buttons and fixes the issues we experience ""for free"". Since the hand tool won't be used in the B2G viewer (for now), why would adding stubs there be better? Note that this patch focusses on fixing the issue, but also tries to improve the code structure.
",timvandermeij,yurydelendik
4085,2014-01-07 22:49:51,"@timvandermeij 

A button that toggles the hand tool needs two features:
- A click handler to toggle the hand tool.
- An updated label when the hand tool is toggled (either via the button or via a shortcut, <kbd>H</kbd> )

Because of the second feature, I think that it makes most sense to keep the event listener binding inside `hand_tool.js`. Otherwise, there's a risk of accidentally forgetting to implement/remove either button feature during a refactor. This has already happened in this PR, by the way:
This PR was supposed to fix the bug. Indeed, it does not immediately cause a run time error (because secondary_toolbar.js checks whether a button exists before binding the event listener). Though it does not deal with the situation where the hand tool functionality is toggled by a call to `HandTool.toggle()` (via the H shortcut at the moment), so sooner or later, an error will occur again.

I think that https://github.com/Rob--W/pdf.js/commit/f2d13a2e2c6f2404d66391e31f22d23ca3b6247d is the best way of approaching the problem. It makes the button argument optional without breaking the hand tool integration.

4074,2014-01-05 12:01:53,"@timvandermeij Thanks for testing! Regarding your observations:
1. I can reproduce this, but it my testing this is only a minor visual glitch. The correct position is still maintained, as far as I can tell. This might be fixed by not having this line enclosed in a `setTimeout`: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/page_view.js#L404, but I don't know if that would cause other issues.
   **EDIT:** After some quick testing, there seems to be no issues with removing the `setTimeout`, so this should be an easy fix.
2. This seems to be _extremely_ intermittent, but the ""good"" thing as far as I'm concerned is that I'm able to reproduce this occasionally in the regular viewer as well (http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html).
   _So I would say that this patch shouldn't be the culprit here!_
",Snuffleupagus,timvandermeij
4074,2014-01-06 18:21:55,"@Snuffleupagus If the fix for the first issue is easy, that would be very nice. It's not a major issue indeed, but if you're zooming in multiple times the flash can be annoying. The second problem is indeed very intermittent, but I can't reproduce it in the regular viewer. However, if you can, then this patch probably doesn't have anything to do with it!
",timvandermeij,Snuffleupagus
4074,2014-01-07 12:11:14,"I've uploaded a new version of this PR, which addresses the issue with the wrong page flashing into view when zooming.
This version also includes an easy way to temporarily/permanently disable this functionality altogether, using the variable `IGNORE_CURRENT_POSITION_ON_ZOOM`.

/botio-linux preview

PS. @timvandermeij Regarding the intermittent issue where a page fails to render, I'm actually able to reproduce it in both Firefox and Chrome, going back over a year in time. Usually, when I'm able to trigger this, the document is zoomed out a lot, meaning multiple pages are visible at the same time.

I've added the test in a commit. It's the first time that I'm attaching a PDF test, and because I was not able to find documentation for `test_manifest.json`, I looked at a few recent commits to that file, and used my human pattern-matching skills to produce something seemingly plausible.

4009,2013-12-07 22:52:27,"@Snuffleupagus The hand tool is behind two layers of abstraction:
- https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/grab_to_pan.js for the actual implementation
- https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/hand_tool.js for integration with PDF.js
- And finally in viewer.js some references to `HandTool.<whatever method>`

The way of [initializing the HandTool](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/88ec2bd1ac4fedf3937665066d84f0ed1d915fe8/web/viewer.js#L144-L147) is consistent with other similar features (toolbars, password prompt and other UI controls).

All of the other buttons inside the secondary toolbar do not cause the toolbar to hide, so I did not divert from this practice either.
If you want to hide the toolbar after clicking, just add `SecondaryToolbar.close()` inside [HandTool's toggle method](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/88ec2bd1ac/web/hand_tool.js#L45-L47).

Personally, I have no preference for either method, because the (dis)advantages are not significantly different.
- Keep current behavior: Consistent with rest of menu
- Hide upon click: Useful for most use cases.

How about the ""Go to first"" / ""Go to last"" option? I think that the arguments for these buttons are similar: The user is probably noy going to use these buttons in succession.

4009,2013-12-08 15:04:50,"@Rob--W You're probably right about the ""Go to first"" / ""Go to last"" options. Perhaps we should consider closing the secondary toolbar for them too.

4000,2013-12-06 08:47:24,"@Hengjie This would enable the open file button in the Firefox addon (and the mozcentral version) as well. That seems strange, since that button was **not** available in the Firefox versions before commit https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/commit/99c9079f54570ab3486e92aebb777b0f5a56baac. (As evident from line: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/commit/99c9079f54570ab3486e92aebb777b0f5a56baac#diff-dd42e9b2d2a652b8e312efa567698aa6L2211).
When PDF.js is set up as the handler for PDF files, opening a PDF file in Firefox can be done through the browsers standard open file menu entry. Hence the open file button was never used in Firefox.

In commit https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/commit/99c9079f54570ab3486e92aebb777b0f5a56baac, the open file button was only disabled in Chrome, so I would suggest not changing the behaviour in Firefox.

2. Fonts print incorrectly POST print dialog. The original bug focused on the print dialog causing the problem, however regression testing has brought me to a manual print scenario.

3958,2013-12-03 11:51:53,"> I just found an intermittent issue with the Firefox addon in this PR. Occasionally, after installing the addon, the database (in about:config) will not get updated at all when files are loaded/viewed. After restarting the browser, everything works as expected though.

The issue appears to be that sometimes when the addon is installed/upgraded, the previous version of `default_preferences.js` will be loaded: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/extensions/firefox/components/PdfStreamConverter.js#L44. This thus prevents writing the ""database"" entry to `about:config`, since the old `default_preferences.js` does not contain that entry until the file in reloaded (by restarting the browser).

I don't know why this happens, or really how to fix this, since it looks like a ""fun"" timing issue.
@brendandahl How should we proceed with this PR?

**EDIT:** This might be fixed if we instead add `//#include default_preferences.js` and then run `PdfStreamConverter.js` through the preprocessor in `make.js`.

HWA was turned on when the error occured. When HWA is turned off, the file displays fine, but only after closing and reopening Firefox.

I'm attaching two screenshots of the Graphics section of about:support. The first one is with HWA on (= with error), the second one is without HWA (= without error).

It is no problem for me to contact the user, so if you need any further information, please ask.

No arguments there!
The reason that I wrote this patch is just that it seems unnecessary to include Microsoft and WebKit code in, for example, mozcentral. Since we even preprocess the CSS to remove unneeded code, I was under the impression that we wanted to get rid of everything that's not necessary.

@brendandahl I'm leaning towards closing this PR, but before I do I want to ask: Would either of these two changes still be OK if the other ones are reverted?

A few questions/ideas:
- What happened with my suggestion (in private chat) to import the Nightly translations if they are available, and otherwise fallback to using the Aurora translations?
  Since it takes 6 weeks from the time that changes lands on mozcentral (Nightly) until they are available in Aurora, using Aurora might mean that it takes a lot longer than necessary before new features are translated in PDF.js.
- Also, would it make sense to specify the list of locales in a separate file, that is read by `make.js`?
  This way it would be easier to add/remove locales, without having to edit the makefile.
",Snuffleupagus,timvandermeij
3762,2013-10-02 19:41:44,"@Snuffleupagus Oh, I forgot to mention. I tried to implement your suggestion, but after several hours of struggling with Node.js, it failed to work properly. Because Nightly doesn't have all translations, we would have to check at least two different places. I tried to implement it by first checking the Nightly channel and if that failed, to try Aurora, etc., but because Node.js code works in parallel and not sequential, this was taking too much time and not all files would be downloaded by Node.js. No matter what I did, it would always do one request and then stop... :-(

I like the idea of your second comment and I will definitely try to implement that. Maybe submitting two PRs is even better, indeed.

3762,2013-10-02 19:52:22,"@timvandermeij I believe that I said something like this previously: if you manage to get the Nightly/Aurora combination working that would be great, but if not don't waste too much time on it.

3753,2013-10-02 14:17:36,"@Snuffleupagus I really like this feature. It makes the panel a lot more useful. I do agree that it would be better to split this up into several PRs, for example for moving the `DocumentOutlineView` code to a separate file.

I have experienced two problems when roughly testing this PR just now:
- If you open http://mirrors.ctan.org/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf, go to the outline panel and click on the `+` sign next to `Typesetting Text`. Now click on the `+` before `Line Breaking and Page Breaking`. Then click `Justified Paragraphs`. You'll see that the document goes to `Justified Paragraphs`, but in the outline view `Line Breaking and Page Breaking` remains selected. Note that this always seems to happen for every first item in each level in the tree. All other items are fine.
- If you open the outline menu and then the secondary toolbar, the outline menu is closed. This isn't the case the other way around.
",timvandermeij,Snuffleupagus
3753,2013-10-02 14:52:05,"@timvandermeij Thanks for the feedback! Regarding your comments:
1. This is probably because I opted to use a really simple algorithm when deciding which Outline Items are selectable, see this function: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/3753/files#diff-687a3b6645757c9ec1df25c970eff9b8R72.
   To keep it as simple as possible, only _one_ Outline Item per page is selectable. This also seems to be in line with how Adobe Reader does things.
   When deciding which Outline Items to select, the one placed highest up on the page will be chosen. This does appear to be handled slightly different in my code compared with Adobe Reader.
   **EDIT:** I'm guessing that Adobe Reader might use an algorithm that is aware of the actual structure of the Outline. My algorithm could be considered blind in that sense. I'm worried that improving this might be unnecessarily complex (= slower than necessary), given that this would be a pretty insignificant part of PDF.js.
   Is this a serious enough issue, that you believe that I should try to re-write the algorithm?
2. The ""Outline Options"" toolbar doesn't provide necessary functionality, like the Secondary toolbar. Since the ""Outline Options"" toolbar needs to be forced closed in a number of circumstances (e.g. when closing the sidebar), it was easier to just close it for _every_ click event rather than only in some situation. This meant that the code could be kept cleaner.
   I think this might be OK, what do you think?
",Snuffleupagus,timvandermeij
3753,2013-10-16 22:42:16,"@Snuffleupagus, I never felt collapsing the outline items -- finding information in huge collapsible tree is not a good thing. Inertia scrolling, e.g. two-finger scroll, is helping quicker find the info. (And I think it's a bad experience trying to hit a small icon with mouse) Ask shorlander for the input.

Highlighting currently visible bookmark might be a useful feature to have.
",yurydelendik,Snuffleupagus
3753,2013-10-17 14:41:24,"@yurydelendik OK, I understand your point of view.
If we remove the collapsing/expanding of outline items, would the following revised suggestion be better?
- Move `DocumentOutlineView` to its own file.
- Refactor the code somewhat, and add a few small tweaks of the CSS.
- Implement highlighting of the currently visible outline item.
",Snuffleupagus,yurydelendik
3753,2013-10-17 17:57:40,"@yurydelendik I think I like the collapsed tree better. I agree that finding information in a huge collapsed tree isn't exactly optimal, but I think finding information in a huge opened tree is also very difficult, not to mention that in the current version the tree is rather simple and therefore not nice to use. If the collapsed tree is really not the way to go according to you, I think adding the classic tree lines (see http://jquery.bassistance.de/treeview/demo/ for example) would already improve this a lot.

Regarding the highlighting, I agree that this is a useful feature, but I still think that the first child item should be selected once you click it and not the parent item (see https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/3753#issuecomment-25541963). It's rather confusing otherwise, I'm afraid...

This certainly makes a lot of sense to me, and I personally wouldn't mind not having any UI in presentation mode.
The reason that I opened this issue, is that I was under the impression that we wanted to have some kind of UI for the functions that currently reside in the context menu in presentation mode.

> If we _really_ don't want any options in presentation mode to keep things simple, then we should also remove the context menu in my opinion.

I completely agree that the context menu should go, if we do not want the functionality it provides.

**EDIT:** @brendandahl Even if what I proposed in this issue isn't the direction that we want to go, would it still make sense to re-factor the presentation mode code and move it out of viewer.js?

I think you have a good point about ""Show Cover Page"", lets see if others agree.
",Snuffleupagus,waddlesplash
3723,2013-09-23 18:53:15,"@Snuffleupagus Two things:
- I must say I'm a bit confused by the text ""Show Cover Page in Two Page View"", or ""Show Cover Page"" for that matter. I think it implies that the cover page would be hidden otherwise, which isn't the case. It's just that it can be viewed separately from the other pages. I would lean more towards something like ""Show Cover Page saperately"", but that's just my two cents!
- If you go to two page view and reload the page, the secondary toolbar is opened on each refresh. I don't know if that was done intentionally, but I can imagine that users are annoyed by that because they have to close it everytime.

The functionality in this PR is really nice. I'll have to take a closer look at the code, but it appears to be working really good. I'll also take a shot at making some descriptive icons.

1. The text ""Show Cover Page in Two Page View"" is taken from the previous PRs. I believe the reason for using that particular string was that it is used in Adobe Reader. This was discussed previously, see: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2660#discussion_r3258734.

3708,2013-10-05 20:02:20,"@timvandermeij Nice that you're making progress!
If we import external libraries, shouldn't they be placed in the `/external` folder (https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/tree/master/external)? Either way, I don't think that you need to worry about the coding style of external libraries.

One other idea: Instead of adding a lot of code in `viewer.js`, what about creating a new file instead (perhaps called `touch_events.js` and structured like the other files that contains code moved from `viewer.js`)?
In that file you could place all the necessary logic to deal with the imported library (that file would then act as a wrapper for the library). This way you would just have to call an initialization function in `viewer.js`, something like `TouchEvents.initialize(...);` and you could place the code that currently is added to `viewer.js` there instead. This might make the implementation a bit cleaner!?

This might be my ""fault"", since I've recently written a few patches that move and refactor the presentation mode code. This code now lives here: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/presentation_mode.js.

The updating of the translation strings for other languages will be done in follow-up PRs, by people speaking the languages in question.

I would suggest creating a function in `PDFView`, similar to the the current download (https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/viewer.js#L628), perhaps called `downloadPageAsImage` and calling that instead of adding all of this code to the `SecondaryToolbar`.

Therefore, PDF.js must be the cause of the corrupted PDF.

3564,2013-08-12 10:30:34,"@Snuffleupagus I agree, but these PDFs have been generated directly from LaTeX, so it would seem strange that they are corrupted, not? Also, the rotation links (which were actually history back/forward links if I recall correctly) do work for me in Adobe Acrobat X and in PDF.js. The page back and forward buttons work in Acrobat, whereas in PDF.js only the forward button works. Hence my thought that PDF.js is still somewhat buggy, although I agree that not all of it is PDF.js' problem.

By the way, that browser tool from @brendandahl is really nice!

Another strange thing: the find bar (magifiying glass icon) only works using the github.io version, not the addon version, for some strange reason.

What defines ""render successfully""? No, there is no such repository since we don't want to store/redistribute PDFs without authors giving us permission to do so. And there is no reason to create central ""private"" repository since we want contributors to help us with addressing the problems and we prefer to keep things open.

Corrupted PDFs? Fix them, why push that burden on any PDF viewer. And any PDF viewer can reject anything that invalid. Also I don't think any contributor wants go through the list of the corrupted PDFs and complain about them not being PDF32000 spec conformant.

If you find common case of PDF corruption, please report it. I think we can help you there. See https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#wiki-issue

3533,2013-08-02 21:33:00,"@yurydelendik, oh, I misunderstood. I thought you are saying if we could integrate such repository into our system, because we already have PDFs. You are saying that if could run/host such system as an independent system ourselves. This would be possible. But maybe pdf.js could even have an optional (developer using pdf.js can decide) opt-in (user can decide) way to report broken PDFs by itself for publicly accessible PDFs. So on error, a prompt will show (like now already) and then additional option that the user could report that.

Maybe we could just use Mozilla's crash reporting tool for that?

3533,2013-08-03 10:13:45,"@yurydelendik Could this please be reopened? I think this is a useful discussion for PDF.js.

@mitar I'm not sure if we can use the crash reporter for this. I think you meant the regular feedback tool Mozilla offers, since a failing PDF file is not really a crash. On top of that, I'm not sure if we can call that tool from the JavaScript, and I think it would require the user to enter all details himself, which can be considered a burden to report broken PDFs.

However, I like your idea of adding a button to the info/warning bar to report a broken PDF. Things to consider are: what do we do if a PDF is visually broken, but no info/warning bar is displayed (that happens quite often when fonts are missing, and then the report button would not be visible) and how can we make the report as automatic as possible, meaning that the user doesn't have to enter anything, but that information such as URL of the PDF, version of PDF.js and error messages are automatically sent? Of course we must make sure not to collect any personal data.

I really like this idea since it is intuitive (the user expects to report something that is broken, and going to GitHub, creating an account, etc. is a burden for lots of people), provides us with a lot of useful information and shouldn't be really hard to implement. We might need to write a custom reporting system, but that cannot be too hard. I wouldn't mind to look into that if other contributors also think that this is a good idea. We can create a simple API, such that PDF.js can just issue a `POST` request to the API, as simple as that.

These are all just thoughts, but I thought I'd let you know how I think about this ;-)

This is left to the implementation. So what I am saying that server-side implementation already exists. Probably it is possible to submit to that repository of crash reporter or bad websites from JavaScript? And pdf.js integrators could make this processes even more streamlined for end users.

Obviously I wasn't able to reproduce that issue either, but this code works just as well in my testing so hopefully this will be fine. I also added a comment to prevent someone from just changing this back in an effort to simplify the code.

I also found that there where issues with scrolling the initial position of the document into view when reloading the page, if the user had specified a hash (i.e. `#disableRange=true` or similar). I missed this, since it was fixed ""for free"" by the previous version of this patch. Hopefully fixing this won't cause other issues.

Finally, I want to apologise for all the problems that this patch has caused! I obviously wouldn't have submitted it if it didn't work in my testing. (Also, I still cannot understand why I've been unable to reproduce even one of the issues you found!)

3513,2013-08-03 21:12:26,"@brendandahl I'm really sorry, but I think we may need to back out this PR.
I've just noticed a couple of issues (it would be ironic if you cannot reproduce any of them):
- When exiting presentation mode, the right page will be scrolled into view, but nothing will be drawn (the page stays blank). To reproduce this issue:
  - Open http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html _and_ wait for the document to finish loading.
  - Enter presentation mode.
  - Change page a couple of times (at least three seemed enough in my testing).
  - Exit presentation mode.
  
  For me, this leads to the right page being scrolled into view, but remaining completely blank. This behaviour seem to be specific to Firefox, since in Chrome the page is rendered but ends up in the wrong scroll position.
  This might actually be solved by moving the line `this.isPresentationMode = false;` in exitPresentationMode (as we discussed on IRC, but rejected since it seemed to hacky). I'm not sure if this is enough to fix the issue completely though.
- When entering presentation mode _before_ the document has finished loading and then going to the next page it will be blank. Unfortunately this issue is intermittent, making it really difficult to debug. So far I haven't been able to make any progress in figuring this out.
- There also seems to be some issues with this fix:
  
  > I also found that there where issues with scrolling the initial position of the document into view when reloading the page, if the user had specified a hash (i.e. #disableRange=true or similar). I missed this, since it was fixed ""for free"" by the previous version of this patch. Hopefully fixing this won't cause other issues.
  
  This might lead to the page not being rendered when you reload the browser. This issue is also intermittent, as it seems to depend on the complexity of the page. I.e. a page with just text works fine, but anything with more complex graphics fails (page 11 of the tracemonkey paper always fail in my tests).
  This issue might be easy to fix with a hack, but a proper solution might not be too easy given the current state of setScale.

So to sum up the above: I don't really understand why some of these things happen and even the ones that I do sort of get, I'm not sure how to fix properly.
@brendandahl Therefore I would suggest backing out this PR, since I cannot promise when or even if I could fix these issues. I will certainly try, but I don't have high hopes given the trouble this has caused me already.

I got it working by simply cloning the repository and running it on a local XAMPP instance. Do not forget that the actual viewer is in the `web/viewer.html` file, so visiting the root folder will result only in a folder listing.

Are you trying to get it working on a web server or on a local XAMPP/WAMP instance? Please post any additional information (exact error messages/warnings from the console and OS/browser) if you keep on getting errors. If you're uploading it to a web server, a link to your viewer can also help track down any problems. We'll be happy to help if you really can't seem to figure it out yourself. :)

@timvandermeij , I can't install XAMPP or any other server agent for some reasons. I have just created a free account, which you can access with the following ftp user details:

1- I downloaded everything with WinHTTrack, then uploaded them and I get this error:

or ""InvalidPDFException"" . It is strange, however, that I could open it offline (without server installed) using Safari, although not fully correct.

2- I get this error (no warning message), but the page doesn't display

3- If I upload the whole zipped folder (all files), I arrive at this error:

However, I am a novice with php and javascript.

I have tried your advise (GET), and it is indeed useful. Now, the loader shows, but not the document. Actually, when I first uploaded the web & src folders, I did so, based on your hint in the following thread:
https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/2371 (please note that the error I got in this case was: [an error occurred while processing this directive])

I don't know Yury, but seems many beginners, face the same issue. I mean, I strongly believe that there is an easy way just like in the following example (mentioned before), where you just upload the folders to get it working, it will be very helpful for me, as well as many others.

3508,2013-07-25 10:24:22,"@AliND The built version is also working for me, though I admit I had to figure out a bit how it worked. I've never built PDF.js before, so I started with https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-PDF.js-in-a-website-%28Debian-Ubuntu%29#wiki-Setup_testing_environnement, but that didn't quite give me a good result. I did the following to get it working on your server (link here: http://pdfjs.eu.pn/pdf.js-build/web/viewer.html):
1. Set the correct line ending if you're on Windows like me: `git config --global core.autocrlf input` (before the next step, or step 3 will fail!).
2. Clone the repository from my fork, using `git clone https://github.com/timvandermeij/pdf.js.git` (but you should use the always up-to-date https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js repository).
3. Run the make command: `node make generic`.
4. After that, I've ignored the rest of https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-PDF.js-in-a-website-%28Debian-Ubuntu%29#wiki-Setup_testing_environnement, since it didn't work for me. It wasn't copying the right files. What I did was go into the `build/generic` folder that was created by step 3 and upload the `build` and `web` folder to the web server. That did it.

I hope your problems are solved by following the steps I've provided here and in my previous comment. Good luck (and sorry for the wall of text!). :-)

@yurydelendik I also find the manual at https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setup-PDF.js-in-a-website-%28Debian-Ubuntu%29#wiki-Setup_testing_environnement slightly confusing. In the section `From build to production` for example, you copy a few files to a production directory, but `pdf.js` itself is not copied, causing a production directory with only the viewer files and not the core files. I have a feeling steps are missing there. Could you check that? I can also rewrite the wiki page using the steps above if you want, because I think that will be more clear for starters (or we need to extend the current wiki page with more steps to include the core files).

3508,2013-07-25 14:04:20,"@timvandermeij, so you followed instruction for ubuntu to setup it on windows? yeah, you will need a special environment for windows to do that (not easy to setup for beginner e.g. https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Setting-up-pdf.js-Development-Environment-for-Windows). Yeah, the wiki is confusing, but an interest in ""testing environment"" already indicate are not a beginner.

That page seems fine to me now. Later this day, I'll make the same type of page, but then focussed on Windows (which is currently a to-do item).

Unbelievable, all what needed to be done was to insert the pdf file into the build folder!

The only needed folders are the web! and the build (with only the pdf.js & the pdf file to be built). Additionally, the locale folder (with locale.properties inside it, if we copy the file from github to local server) should be included in the web folder.

For this pretty easy, straight-forward method, credit goes to you @timvandermeij  for guidance on where to put the pdf file (inside the build folder), and to @yurydelendik for figuring the GET.html problem.

http://pdfjs.eu.pn/pdffinal/web/viewer.html 

But still there is one problem, it views perfectly in Firefox, Chrome, and Opera. For Explorer and Opera, however, there are two errors:
Safari: Missing PDF ""sample.pdf"". But still, the loader works fine!
Explorer: just the style, nothing loads!

I mean, I feel like it is strange because the compatibility.js is there, and I wonder what could cause this behavior for these browsers. Anyways, I have also uploaded all the other files and folders but didn't have luck!.

@timvandermeij: If I use your method, and upload the whole folder like I did before, I get the following error in the following link. Kindly note that, no matter whether I extract and upload or upload and extract -> same problem. Besides, pdf.js-master.zip & mozilla-pdf.js-v0.5.5-1283-gc682c25.zip are the same files, so I wonder why two at a time.

I just don't understand why! I have even downloaded the folder pdf3.js you uploaded, reuploaded it again! and still, it doesn't work!

I mean, what I am really concerned about is the reason for which it is not working with the two other browsers!

I got it working, Thanks Tim - I used Safari element inspector this time and for some reasons, it is directing toward web/sample.pdf instead of build/sample.pdf. Same goes for Internet Explorer! Kindly note the internal links in the pdf file doesn't work in IE but this is not a problem.

Without any doubts, the build method is the correct one although one can create separate viewer.js for each pdf file.

Now if you go to http://pdfjs.eu.pn/pdffinal/web/viewer.html , it works in all the 5-mentioned browsers. (note: sometimes, the browsers can't find some files on this free server, but on the paid server - it works without any problems).

For future users, an easy way is:
1- Clone http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html (you can use HTTrack).
2- You will have two folders: web & build (the later will have pdf.js which is the most important - HTTrack in this case, combine all the build actions into this file)
2- Open the pdf.js (build folder) and change GET.html to GET 
3- Open viewer.js (web folder) and change the name of the pdf file to your own.
4- Put your pdf file in both the web (Safari & IE) & build folders (other browsers) (you can alter a bit, put the pdf.js in the web folder, then there wouldn't be need to include the same pdf twice, but this might require some work!)
5- Upload
6- It should be working now! note that this method might have flaws which I am unaware of.

Actually, your method works perfectly on the free server; I just tried it but seems that I have the problem with the paid server this time! I have just opened a support ticket so they can look up into the issue. 

So for future users also, and aside from the build method, what @timvandermeij did works perfectly and it is much easier than the previously mentioned method. For reference:
1- Just download the master zip file, either extract it and upload, or upload and extract if the control panel allows for this (the second method is much faster). Of course, there are some files and/or folders not needed, but just upload the whole thing :D.
2- Open the viewer.js (in web folder) and change the name of the pdf file to your own. Upload (reupload) this viewer.js
3- Upload your pdf file (with the name specified in step 2) to the web folder.
4- Done (If it doesn't work, it means there is a problem with your host; try a free host and see for yourself).

Since this is a bug in Firefox and not in PDF.js, I'm closing this PR.

> @Rob--W : I have implemented your commit in my project. This works except for documents with a lot of pages (40+). Then I get a lot of warnings in my console ""[l10n] #thumb_page_title missing for [nl]

In the first post of #3481, bullet point 3, I've said:

> There's only one problem: I've noticed that for large documents (e.g. TAMReview.pdf from tests/), the pdf page [Cache manager](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/e5cd027dce073209505e57d36b6045c8856ec713/web/ui_utils.js#L225-L235) disposes pages, causing the callback loop to loop forever. Should this problem be solved by temporarily changing the cache size to Infinity, or by changing the render method?

When the ""cache"" in PDF.js exceeds [`CACHE_SIZE`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/e5cd027dce073209505e57d36b6045c8856ec713/web/viewer.js#L28) (currently 20 pages), old entries are discarded, resulting in missing pages. What you're observing could be related to this. What happens if you use `var CACHE_SIZE = Infinity;`?
",Rob--W,Rob--W
3481,2013-08-14 15:27:58,"@Rob--W : Setting the cache to infinite is not a good idea. The print screen opened after 1 minute, and then my PC stopped working. Even when I set the cache to 50. Documents with less then 20 pages work well.

3472,2013-07-16 10:07:22,"@timvandermeij First a visual nit: when the sidebar is initially opened, there is now a slight separation between the ""dragger"" and the sidebar. Also, I do believe that the whole UI of this functionality needs input from a designer.

The more serious issue with the current state of this PR is that the document isn't properly resized when you resize the sidebar. To see what I mean, set the zoom level to ""page width"" (or ""auto"") before resizing the sidebar. Notice that the document will not be resized. I'm guessing that this might be a bit hard to address in a good way, since rendering is expensive in terms of CPU time and resizing the sidebar would trigger re-rendering many times in quick succession.
",Snuffleupagus,timvandermeij
3472,2013-07-16 10:12:16,"@Snuffleupagus A way to make the operation not as expensive is to only render once the mouse is released, or to throttle the render requests (implemented like underscore's [debounce method](http://underscorejs.org/#debounce)).

1. Skips suggesting a file name if the path ends with .pdf.
2. Otherwise; returns the last XXXX.pdf in the query string.
3. Otherwise; returns the last XXXX.pdf in the reference fragment.

In case 2 and 3, the steps are repeated with the URL-decoded value if needed.

I want to move this logic to web/viewer.js, because the filename suggestion logic is also beneficial to non-Firefox add-ons. Then, I will pass an extra parameter `suggestedFileName` to the `data` object of the `download` method.

As far as I know, the `download` method in PdfStreamConverter.js is only used by web/viewer.js, so it should be OK to move this logic. Do you agree?

3451,2013-08-09 14:33:49,"I've tried to look into this, and the following is a summary of my findings thus far.

AcroForms are described in section 12.7 in the ISO version of the PDF specification ([available here](http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf)).
According to the specification, the only entry in the AcroForm dictionary that is always required is the `Fields` array which is described as:

> An array of references to the document’s root fields (those with no ancestors in the field hierarchy).

To decide if a PDF file actually contains a usable form, I've deduced the following ""algorithm"":

---
- **If** the AcroForm dictionary contains an `XFA` entry, assume that the document contains a form.
- **Else**
  - **If** the `Fields` entry is missing, this means that the PDF file violates the specification. In this case, to avoid trouble, just assume that the document contains a form.
  - **Else**
    - **If** the `Fields` entry is an array with `length > 0` (it contains at least on element), this means that the document contains an actual form.
    - **Else** (This is where it gets slightly tricky!)
      
      According to the specification, the `Fields` array could actually be empty even though the PDF contains a valid form (see quote above). This means that just deciding that the document does not contain any form elements based on an empty `Fields` array is unfortunately wrong. (It seems that this is usually the case, but you cannot assume that it's always true). 
      Instead the only option seems to be to iterate through the pages of the document, to check for any appearance of an `Annots` dictionary. (This seems to basically be in-line with the following discussion regarding the same issue in iText, see: http://itext-general.2136553.n4.nabble.com/AcroForm-with-empty-Fields-array-td2172109.html)
      
      In summary: If the `Fields` array is empty _and_ the document catalogue contains no references to any annotations, it should be safe to assume that there are no actual form elements in the PDF.

---

In the above, I've tried to err on the side of caution since false positives should be preferred over false negatives. 

The analysis of the document catalogues in PDF files was really simple using the nice tool available here: http://brendandahl.github.io/pdf.js.utils/browser/.

In formulating and testing the above ""algorithm"", I've used all the PDF files that are tagged with ""forms"" in the Github issues (as well as some I found on Bugzilla). I checked them with the tool provided by @brendandahl and I also tried opening them in Adobe Reader to check the behaviour.

I've also taken a stab at implementing this algorithm, and it seems to work OK. The code is available here: https://github.com/Snuffleupagus/pdf.js/compare/acroForm-warnings.
Please note that this is a ten minute hack, just to see if it would work, so even if the basic idea is sound I don't expect that this is anywhere near good enough to be included in PDF.js as is. (Also, I don't have a great deal of experience with this part of the codebase.)

For those of you that managed to read all the way to the end, sorry about the wall of text!
Also, if you have any feedback on this, please let me know!

3431,2013-09-05 21:10:19,"@brendandahl I have made a new version of this PR. The previous approach wasn't sound, so I thought of a new approach that would not require all those ugly checks and an event listener on the document. I have managed to come up with a solution that doesn't hide the annotation if the context menu is used (for text copying purposes), but does hide is when you move your mouse out of the popup (like you mentioned in your review). I have also made this implementation more modular by avoiding code duplication when hiding and showing the annotations. At last I removed the mouse pointer from the annotation icon, as it makes people think you can click on it while it actually does nothing.

Could you review this again and let me know if this approach is better?

Edit: just pushed an even easier implementation. Can't make it any easier than this :)

This solution works by adding a `<div class=""annotationLayer"">` to the page, and placing all annotations inside it. To avoid the issue with multiple versions of the same annotations being present, when ever `setupAnnotations` is called, if an instance of `<div class=""annotationLayer"">` already exists it will be removed.
In my testing, this solves all issues with annotations not being removed properly when the document is redrawn.

Another thought is that the browser might not support range requests, try http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html#disableRange=true.

If neither of these has any effect on the issue, you will have to follow the advice offered by @yurydelendik:

The PDF linked in #2388 exhibits similar behavior to the PDFs we have, in that it raises the same error without creating any kind of notification (there is one difference, in that the PDF in #2388 actually loads entirely before the console registers an error; our PDFs never load at all).

You can simply use `text_layer_builder.js` as is, because what you pass into the constructor are references to `PDFFindBar` and `PDFFindController`, and if those aren't passed in, `TextLayerBuilder` doesn't use them.

3258,2013-06-02 22:34:38,"@timvandermeij This PR doesn't really change anything with regards to the current resizing of the zoom box, it just fixes a small bug and refactors some of the code. So I don't really understand how this PR is to blame!?

Also, I think that I solved _most_ of these overlap issues in my patches for #2792. That said, in the Dutch l10n the zoom box is so huge, that these changes probably won't help completely. The problem is that if we change this to work perfectly in Dutch, it would look bad in all (or almost all) other languages since it would introduce a lot of wasted space in the toolbar.
I don't speak Dutch, but would it be possible to change the translation somewhat to mitigate the issue?

Ninja edit: I just tried the latest Firefox extension from #2792, and it's almost perfect _even_ in Dutch!
As a said previously (https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2792#issuecomment-17947609), I think that as long as it looks and works OK in Firefox, I personally can live with a few small issues in the web viewer.

3244,2013-06-23 13:56:55,"I'm no longer able to reproduce this issue, using the STR provided by @yurydelendik.
It would be interesting to know what fixed this, since as far as I know there hasn't been any recent changes of the page rendering.
I always assumed that this since bug was intermittent, it was the result of some sort of race condition that prevented the rendering from finishing after it had been paused. The only idea that I have, is that this _might_ have be fixed by the implementation of A+ compatible promises (in #3340). My reasoning here is that under some particular circumstances (which caused this bug), the previous promises implementation didn't resolve a pending rendering promise correctly.

I don't know it the above makes sense, or if it's even a remotely plausible solution, but the important thing is that this issue seems to be fixed. If other people are able to confirm this as solved, I would suggest closing this issue.

3224,2013-05-08 13:37:54,"> I think it will be much better if we will not change the view height because of the progress bar. Can we overlay the bar on top of the pages?

I think that would re-introduce the visual bug described here: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2719#issuecomment-15518329.

I suppose that we could instead just ignore the height of the progressive loading bar, here: https://github.com/Snuffleupagus/pdf.js/blob/f6e1c9e23122c7c8054003355a11d8bdcda7f24c/web/viewer.js#L800.
The only issue with that solution is that it wouldn't look as good, since the pages wouldn't fit perfectly in the viewer until the loading bar was removed.

@yurydelendik Visually I prefer my solution, but from a performance perspective your solution is a lot better since it avoids having to rescale the document. Should I implement your idea instead?

3150,2013-05-02 09:43:41,"Thanks @mduan  for your response ,
but the same error still appears to me ,and to explain it better ,i put the viewer in dropbox and this is the public links you can try it :
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37262502/PDF.js_mduan/pdf.js/web/viewer.html
this viewer gives the error :

but when i changed the pdf path from  
DEFAULT_URL='https://kotob.s3.amazonaws.com/neo.pdf'
 to :
 DEFAULT_URL='neo.pdf' 
by putting the file in the same viewer directory ,it works fine with range requests:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/37262502/PDF.js_mduan/pdf.js/web/viewer2.html
and note that we are making the CORS policy accessible from any other origin for get requests.

These at present don't seem to render at all, so I'm looking for perhaps a way I can request that the files be exported with certain settings, or alternatively, perhaps opened and re-saved via something like illustrator/reader pro with particular settings to maximise compatibility.

From the second part of your question, it seems that you aren't trying to use the API, but rather a function from the file `viewer.js`. The function you refer to is found here: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/viewer.js#L988. From the code, you can thus see that the second parameter in `PDFView.open` is the scale.

3044,2013-04-04 22:15:53,"@yurydelendik Yes, I am using the internal PDF viewer in Firefox 20. I've tried with a fresh profile and get the same results. This is under Windows 7.

I then tried it on a different PC under Windows XP. In the screenshots below I've highlighted the differences. (Note that the screens had different resolutions, hence the change of size).

It's hard to believe that this is a Win 7 vs. Win XP problem (and timvandermeij confirms that Win 7 is OK), so there must be something odd with the FF setup on my PC. It's not a font problem because Acrobat displays the document perfectly.

Any ideas please?

Yes, it does open PDF by clicking pdf links online.

I would like to know about handling of PDF files when opening it via ""Ctrl +o"".
It seems only plugins such as Chrome's buit-in or Adobe's can handle that.

If that is the case, Is there a way to bring up the extension interface with blank pdf ?

3042,2014-05-13 21:10:53,"@Rob--W , I don't know if I understood your question. What is a managed installation? Here's what we got:
Our custom built Debian ditro with everything we need inside, including chrome and all of its plugins. We have to toss everything in prior to building the distro for security reasons. The rooms where the machines sit are public. If anyone tempers with the machines or manages to pass our security checks, when the system reboots, everything gets back to default.
So, we are installing plugins from chrome web store to our machines and copying their files into our OS skeleton prior to building. When it builds, it takes chrome ang plugins along.
Did I answer you?
Thank you again.

The reason that I ask is that just resetting the `PDFHistory` is easy, but clearing out the history in the browser might be slightly more complicated.

I hope that the comment I added to the 'isHashChangeUnlocked' function makes sense: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2921/files#L0R764. I found it slightly difficult to, in a clear and concise way, describe the reason that the function looks like it does, so please let me know if I need to reformulate the comment.

This solution obviously works , but the problem is it works for some documents and for some documents it still shows the old feature of spilling over to next page.

Eg 1:

/show_pdf/123.pdf#page=2&zoom=75 ->goes to page 2 . Works well.

/show_pdf/456.pdf#page=2&zoom=75 ->goes to page 3 !!!! If I remove zoom parameter, it redirects fine to page 2.

So can u please tell why this happening . For one pdf it works well, but for some other pdf it still shows the same old behavior.

Are there any other factors related to pdf document that we should take care of???

It has been more than one year now and we are still experiencing wierd behaviours of this plugin with respect to zoom parameters.

Just have a look at my previous comment on this same page. I sat for hours to debug but could not find the reason as to why it is happening like this.

2802,2013-03-06 19:14:27,"@yurydelendik - I was looking into the code earlier and trying trace the error. One question that came to my mind is JBIG2 is a image format but the my PDFs were created from TIFFs. As for the code - 

 // 6.5.8.2 Refinement/aggregate-coded symbol bitmap
          var numberOfInstances = decodeInteger(contextCache, 'IAAI', decoder);
          if (numberOfInstances > 1)
           error('JBIG2 error: number of instances > 1 is not supported');

I am kinda new to the JBIG2 format and would like to know what it means numberOfInstances and if it is not supported by JBIG2, is there a need to use a different format other than JBIG2.  
",ashmashrest,yurydelendik
2802,2013-03-06 20:35:41,"@gigaherz Thanks for the explanation David. My scenario is a bit unique since we digitize microfilms, books and many other resources and make it available for users. We had few requirements - OCR the scanned TIFF and deep compress the TIFFs and provide easy access download capability for the users. We have more than around 50k scanned (OCRed) PDF via CVISION available which does not work open on Firefox with PDF.js at all. That being said, we provide users who are usually non-tech to download the resource which if we decide to use another file format might make then confused on how to read the file where as PDFs are very common.

",Snuffleupagus,yurydelendik
2792,2013-02-24 17:17:45,"@timvandermeij First of all, nice that you're working on this!
A few very quick observations:
- The name `settingsContainer` seems wrong to me, why not `secondaryToolbar` or similar. Since this is really just another toolbar, why not including that word in the name. (What you had in your first mock-up in #2714 is a settings UI in my opinion.)
- Also, when you do comparisons remember to use strict equalities `===`/`!==`.

Edit: 

> Only slide the viewerContainer, not the mainContainer (couldn't get this to work properly, because if I did this, the bar would move into the viewerContainer, but would not move the viewerContainer itself).

I would suggest that this new toolbar should overlay the document (perhaps with a slight opaque background colour), 
similar to how the sidebar works at lower resolutions. To see this behaviour in action, try ""Responsive Design View"" from the ""Web Developer"" menu in Firefox (`Ctrl+Shift+M`).

Some very quick feedback:
- I don't think that this toolbar should close automatically. It should rather be done either by clicking the button again or by pressing the Escape key. The current behaviour becomes quite tedious when you want to change a number of different options in a row.
- Again, I personally don't like this secondary toolbar changing the size of the viewport. In my opinion it should overlay the viewport instead.

@timvandermeij As you suggested, just squash the commits and it will be OK.

Also, I really think that we need feedback on this from UI/UX sooner rather than later, to prevent having to change to many things later on.

How about replicating what the viewer does when it has a small screen and needs to display the sidebar, except ALWAYS do it that way. (Hint: try it in Responsive Design View with a screen width of around 455px).

As for the patch, ignore it. It appears fine in the ""files changed"" so it should be fine elsewhere.

I was not sure about the cursor:pointer as the buttons in the toolbar also do not have cursor:pointer. I agree it would feel more natural, but wouldn't we want to add it to the buttons in the regular top toolbar too then?

About the styling: hard to decide. I think the find bar is pretty neat, but as @waddlesplash points out, this is more of a menu. I'm not sure which of the two layouts I like best.

What is exactly the problem with the context menu? In the latest viewer preview, I can still right-click and get the context menu, both in normal mode and presentation mode. Navigation using a mouse click or scroll is still possible. What am I missing here? Just curious about that, but I will put back the context menu if it is a problem now.

I'll update the to-do list and probably work on these points tomorrow.

All of this might make the new toolbar unnecessarily long, and force scrolling on smaller screens. What do you think about the height of the buttons?

I've added a couple of the standard toolbar buttons to the secondary toolbar as well, see https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2792/files#L31R104.

2792,2013-05-15 15:53:08,"@timvandermeij I've just pushed a patch that tries to address button overlap in the main toolbar, i.e. buttons should not overlap any more. This was mostly an issue in the web viewer, since there are more buttons in the main toolbar in the general viewer compared to the viewer in the Firefox extension/built-in version. I've prioritized the look in Firefox, since pdf.js is a Mozilla project after all. That said though, it should look better in all versions of the viewer.
This patch also changes when buttons are hidden/shown in the toolbars, to improve the UI and again to prevent overlapping.
**Edit:** Part of these changes moves the zoom buttons slightly to the right, hence this should also help somewhat in issue #3252.

Regarding tabindex:
I would suggest giving the `tools` button the lowest free index, which should be `17`, and then number the secondary toolbar buttons `18`, `19` and so on from the top of the secondary toolbar.
You also have to change the tab indexes in the findbar, since there will now be duplicates. I suggest changing them from `21 ... 25` to `41 ... 45`, to allow space for more buttons in the secondary toolbar.

I've completely rewritten the code for showing/hiding the toolbar, which should clean up the logic quite a bit. Also, I think that it's a bit easier to read the code if the event listeners and related functions are grouped together.

I actually think that it might be good to move the entire `secondaryToolbar` to `ui_utils.js`, but I think it might be best to see what the reviewer has to say first. (It should be a fairly straightforward change.)

2792,2013-07-12 19:32:35,"> Edit: the findbar cannot be closed by clicking on the viewer part, so either one of them is inconsistent, I guess.

I didn't mean mimicking the exact behaviour of the integrated findbar, but rather writing the show/hide code in a similar way, to enhance readability.
I still think that it's good if you can open the secondary toolbar, and then click on other buttons in the toolbar without the secondary toolbar closing. In my opinion, doing it any other way wouldn't be very practical, hence this isn't so much an issue as a feature ;-)
@timvandermeij What do you think?
",Snuffleupagus,timvandermeij
2792,2013-07-12 19:36:42,"@Snuffleupagus I agree. It would be annoying if the secondary toolbar disappeared when clicking a toolbar button. I thought it was only the bar itself that would close the secondary toolbar, not also the buttons. But since that's what is happening, I think the behaviour you described is best.

2792,2013-07-18 16:57:38,"@Snuffleupagus I think I'll move the `secondaryToolbar` object into a new file so `viewer.js` gets smaller, just like you did in #3489. I reckon it could also be done for #3472. It is indeed good to have more smaller-sized files with a meaningful name than to have one big `viewer.js` file.
",timvandermeij,Snuffleupagus
2792,2013-07-18 18:36:41,"@timvandermeij That might not be a bad idea!
I asked yury on IRC what the criteria was for placing code in `ui_utils.js` vs in its own file. Obviously it somewhat depends on the kind of code, but approx. 50 lines can be considered a soft limit when adding code in `ui_utils.js`.

If you wonder how this should look, I think that #3489 will serve as a good guide. Obviously, I'm also happy to answer questions, if you have any!

2792,2013-07-18 18:54:45,"@Snuffleupagus Great, thank you! I think the code looks nicer in a separate file, otherwise `ui_utils.js` can become a quite larger (and I think `secondary_toolbar.js` is a lot more meaningful than `ui_utils.js`, because it doesn't say what kind of utilities are in there). I'll go ahead and do this now, using #3489 as reference.
",timvandermeij,Snuffleupagus
2792,2013-07-18 19:20:16,"@Snuffleupagus Done, but there are three things I'm not too sure about:
1. Are the globals in `secondaryToolbar.js` correct? How can you know?
2. In `viewer.html`, should I move https://github.com/timvandermeij/pdf.js/commit/c2ebd9cc0a765ae19ac6693b7ca32a5ab33c51b4#L27R87 above https://github.com/timvandermeij/pdf.js/commit/c2ebd9cc0a765ae19ac6693b7ca32a5ab33c51b4#L27R84 since `pdf_find_bar.js` now requires the secondary toolbar (see https://github.com/timvandermeij/pdf.js/commit/c2ebd9cc0a765ae19ac6693b7ca32a5ab33c51b4#L24R19), so it must be declared above it?

2792,2013-07-19 14:55:33,"@Snuffleupagus Thank you for your commits! I do have a few questions about them, so I hope you can explain this to me.
- Take for example https://github.com/timvandermeij/pdf.js/commit/c9e5f9af58d4cccd0df5e3d3d547d5267feeee35#L0R47. This is performed at initialization of the secondary toolbar, so the event handlers are attached at that time. So why is https://github.com/timvandermeij/pdf.js/commit/c9e5f9af58d4cccd0df5e3d3d547d5267feeee35#L1R2400 still needed then? It seems double to me, since you already attach the event handlers at initialization of the secondary toolbar object and now it's done again outside of the object, but it's probably just because I don't really understand why this is there.
- Could you also explain a little bit how https://github.com/timvandermeij/pdf.js/commit/6e77c9b9721e96c4163fb2ed9d877b2f8653ef0a works? You call blur() such that the object loses focus, but how does that achieve the same result as pressing `Esc`?
- Is your last commit fixing the issues as outlined in the diff discussion above?

By the way, if this is clear, I'll squash the commits again.
",timvandermeij,Snuffleupagus
2792,2013-07-19 15:45:33,"@timvandermeij Your observation is correct. The duplication of events can be removed (I suggest to get rid of those below `var sT = secondaryToolbar;`)

2792,2013-07-19 16:01:47,"@Snuffleupagus I see, you're right about those buttons. I don't see a way how we can avoid that little bit of duplication, because the user must be able to take out the secondary toolbar without breaking the other buttons. Then we'll leave it like this. I also understand your second explanation about `Esc`, so thank you!

Could you fix the removal of the `sT` variable as outlined in the diff discussion? After that, I'll squash all commits and maybe we can make a new preview to check if it still works the way it should.

The search-highlighting depends on the content in the textLayer. As you changes the content (don't show certain parts) I was afraid this might break the way text is highlighted. However, it turned out to not be the case as for search highlighting the spaces you don't add anymore are added again during the highlighting phase. So I guess we are lucky and save.

The way that range requests work right now is that a request is made for the full pdf and once the headers for the full request are returned, we issue a range request. If the range request completes successfully, we cancel the full request and start issuing range requests unless the full request is already complete.

What I think might be happening is that the server is not returning the headers separately from the body. So when headers are received, the full request is already complete and so range requests are not issued.

- When a file isn't in the `database` in about:config, the zoom level seems to default to 100% instead of automatic.

I like the look of the new progress bar, but I have one minor nit. When the progress bar is visible, it overlays the scroll bar. See attached image:

I'll try to fix this if it's easy, otherwise I might leave to a subsequent PR since it doesn't seem to be a common use case.

Are you sure this is specific to my PR? I get the same behaviour with `master` (The zoom level starts as automatic and changes to 100% once the document loads). So maybe something else broke this.

**EDIT**: Actually, it does look like I broke this. I'll fix it.

I think, at least in this case, a simple sub-menu with 3 selections would work better: ""Single Page"", ""Two Page"", ""Two Page with separate cover"". As things are right now, the cover option is a mode that builds on two-page mode, so it could just as well be another radio entry.

This one looks promising to me. From the screenshot it looks like you've implemented this as another sidebar? Can we just have a popup menu like the build-in findbar?

The modular settings window you've showed before could be used for more advanced settings. There might be an option ""Advanced settings"" in the drop-down setting panel that you get once you press the bottom to the top-right. I agree with @gigaherz that having only this kind of modal window for all the settings is too heavy for small settings to change.

Personally, I don't think that a pop-up menu like the findbar would work, as we will need to add more settings here. For example, now I have only added the first/last page options to the settings sidebar, but we will also need to add both rotation options and the page view options (two-up, etc.) there, so I think that a pop-up menu would be either too small or, if we make it larger, disturb the user. The sidebar sliding in seems more elegant to me (just like the left sidebar). What do others think about this?

The modal dialog can indeed be used later on if we have more persistent settings, like ""Always use two page view for all PDFs"".

This is still just I prototype, so there is a couple of issues that needs to be addressed, before it could be considered for merging. The biggest thing I'm worried about, is that some of this code might slow down the viewer, so I'm going to use the profiler in Firebug to make sure it's OK.

@jviereck I hadn't seen this, thanks for letting me know! Even if it's just a visual bug, it's still _really_ annoying.

",pdfjsbot,jviereck
2660,2013-02-06 22:26:58,"@waddlesplash This is a great effort so far, but I have made a couple of observations:
- If you activate two-up and then set zoom to `page-width`, each row will contain _three_ (!) pages. Sometimes this doesn't always show right away, but if you toggle between `automatic zoom` and `page-width` a few times, it will show up.
- In the preview, the full screen mode is completely broken if two-up is active.
- When two-up is active and the zoom is set to 'page-fit', the vertical alignment of the pages becomes wrong. In this configuration, the uppermost pixels of the next pages become visible in the bottom of the screen. Note that I can only reproduce this if ""Show Cover Page in Two Page View"" is toggled _on_.
- In two-up view the margin to the left of the pages is always bigger than the right one, i.e. the pages gets placed of-centre horizontally in the viewerContainer.
  **Edit:** From looking at the HTML/CSS with the inspector in Firebug, it's clear that the margins are set totally wrong. Perhaps it would be good to instead define a special CSS class that gets invoked when switching to two-up. (This might also fix full screen mode.)
- There seems to be some issue regarding the rendering of pages when toggling ""Show Cover Page in Two Page View"". Until you actually scroll, or change page, the pages won't render.
- The above also sometimes happen when switching to/from two-up, but less frequently.
- **Edit2:** It seems that the right hand page in two-up mode doesn't render as it should when scrolling. Observing how `PDFView.getVisiblePages().views` changes while scrolling down in a document probably explains a lot. Currently `PDFView.getVisiblePages().views` doesn't always correspond to what you actually see on the screen.
- **Edit:** When zooming in, the horizontal scrollbar don't get big enough, so some of the pages gets clipped of particular on the left side. This might be related to the margins, see above.

I _really_ hope that the above doesn't sound negative. I'm excited about a working two-up mode in pdf.js and wanted to help out by adding my thoughts.

2660,2013-02-23 15:19:34,"I've found four new issues (this is with the latest code from your repo, not the preview in this thread):
- Activate ""two page view"", toggle ""show cover page"" _off_ and scroll down to the bottom of the document.
  The last left-hand page is now offset vertically compared to the right page.
- Toggle ""show cover page"" _off_ first, then activate ""two page view"". The ""show cover page"" option in the menu will now be reversed compared to what's visible on screen.
- Activate ""two page view"", toggle ""show cover page"" _off_ and then activate ""one page view"". The first two pages are still displayed side by side.
- In fullscreen mode, if ""two page view"" is active, it's impossible to get to the last page in the document.

Also, I'm still having some issues with pages, seems to affect mostly the right-hand ones, not rendering until I actually scroll in the document. I'm sorry to be a pain about this, but I still believe that this might be tied to the fact that `getVisiblePages()` isn't correct when twoUp mode is active.
Unfortunately this issue is somewhat hard to reproduce consistently, but if you want me to I'm willing to try modifying  `getVisiblePages()` to see if that helps.

Regarding your comment:

> @gigaherz the bug you reported with the top parts of the next pages being visible in twoup happens because there is not enough room horizontally for the entire page to be shown. If you squish your browser window horizontally enough, the same thing happens in one-page view. So it is not a real issue.

Uncheck 'Show cover page' and switch to two-page view whilst being scrolled to the top of the document.

I'm not an UX guy either, but thanks ;)

Testing the preview, I've notice the pre-render code doesn't render two pages in advance if we are in the two-page up mode but still only one page. Can you try to fix this?

@Snuffleupagus was in charge of that. I don't get that happening to me, 
though.

Another thing I don't notice (having a big, fast GPU probably helps).

@jviereck That would would explain why you have to wait for the right-hand page to render. Unfortunately I have no experience with that part of the code yet, but I have a feeling that's about to change ;-).
My small contribution to this PR is making changes to `getVisiblePages()`, so that it returns _all_ the pages that is actually visible in twoUp mode.
Fixing the rendering would probably help make the user experience smoother (not having to wait for pages to render), but might lead to worse performance since it will pre-render even more than what is done currently.

> Also, the performance is bad for me with two pages. But I think that's just some problems with the overall performance of the viewer (textLayer/shadows, ...) and should be addressed in a follow up issue.

Apart from the pre-rendering issues, I don't have any real problems either, but I too use a fairly powerful CPU/GPU. I'm going to try this PR on a slightly older laptop to see if I can reproduce what you describe.
Unfortunately these kind of optimizations might be out of my league, so if someone has any good ideas how to improve this, feel free to step in!

2647,2014-04-08 20:33:19,"@pablofiu My experience with Jasmine is with AngularJS and using it for unit testing which I believe is what we're doing here. If we write a set of nice unit tests then it should push it toward something a bit more cohesive.

@yurydelendik I'm working on this issue in between taking care of my kids so I'll be making slow progress but I've gotten the SHA256 routine up and running and I'm hoping to get the AES256 running in the next day or two. It's been fun remembering how bit operations and the difference between little/big endian. 
",danieljwest,yurydelendik
2647,2014-04-11 18:10:33,"More information...
The PDF attached to this issue has a V value of 5 (AES256) and an R value of 5 which is the algorithm linked above in extension 3.
However, with the latest and greatest PDF 2.0, Revision 5 is ""deprecated"" as it apparently contains a security flaw of some sort. 
PDF 2.0's encryption (ISO 32000-2) is designated with a V value of 5 (AES256) and an R value of 6. Fortunately and unfortunately, the decryption algorithm for Revision 5 and Revision 6 aren't too different... except the hashing... Revision 5 just used SHA256 with some concatenated values.. Revision 6 uses SHA256 with some concatenated values... and then uses it a good 64 times more... and then uses AES128 encryption... and SHA192 or 512 depending on the last digit modulo 3.... and then does another round just to be sure. 

The closest I could come to the latest ISO 32000-2 version is here..
https://www.dropbox.com/s/mvogtqrggy5wlmm/ISO-TC171-SC2_N0862_ISO_32000-2-20140220.pdf
(Which is the latest version to be voted on) 

I'll continue implementing Algorithm 5 Revision 5 for the time being as well as SHA192/512, and AES encryption for future use in Revision 6.

2594,2016-09-16 13:50:00,"We've done a little more digging into this at ShareLaTeX, and it looks like the patch above (https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/7482 by @brendandahl) is on the right lines in terms of moving characters into the private use area, but doesn't cover all the necessary cases. The PDFs generated by ps2pdf work, but those generated directly by pdflatex still have this rendering problem.

If we naively move _everything_ to the private use area (e.g. https://github.com/brendandahl/pdf.js/compare/move-non-unicode-glyphs...briangough:put-all-symbolic-chars-in-private-use-area), then it renders correctly. However, this is just a debugging example since I assume this isn't a good idea. 

At this point our knowledge reaches the limit and we don't know how to identify the correct symbols to put in the private use area. So is there anything we can do to help move this forwards?
",jpallen,brendandahl
2594,2016-10-17 18:18:30,"I started reviewing #7705 and started to wonder why my original patch didn't also fix `test-pdftex.pdf`. Just looking at the font data it looks like pdf.js should move the majority of the glyphs from `DVFZZA+CMEX10` to the private use area since most of them do not have valid glyph name to unicode values. For example, one of problematic glyphs (charcode=110 name='braceleftBig') does not have a unicode value but it was being mapped to 'n'. The issue seems to come from when we build a unicode map, it correctly contains 68 values with glyphs that have matching unicode values, but after building it we add back all the original encoding values, hence 110 gets filled in with 'n'.

I'm not quite sure what the right fix is here because if we remove the code to add back encoding values then our text selection will regress from https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/commit/325f7afcca30c891ec7be06a5178c012a052bd55

Maybe @Snuffleupagus has some thoughts...

2553,2014-04-14 09:01:49,"Hi,
Firefox can be used in a lot of situations, therefore two more clicks per PDF for a generic user is nothing, but 2 more clicks per PDF for thousands of employees who prints hundreds of thousands of contractual PDFs a month are a lot of clicks.

Firefox is available on Mac OS X. But Adobe no longer supports Firefox on Mac OS X. The solution Adobe gives is to move to Safari to use their plugin...

We print contractual documents on preprinted paper, every PDF document was validated with Adobe Reader, moving to another tool to print would force us to validate each one and to correct some to fit perfectly in the preprinted paper. That's a huge work, we have hundreds of document models.

Pdf.js is a very good tool to have a preview of any pdf with Firefox on Mac OS  X, even if it's not perfectly accurate and can't be used for printing for us.
We changed the source of Pdf.js so that clicking the print icon will launch Adobe Reader, as if we clicked the download button. But we're stuck with the dialog box ""Open with or download?"" which force the user to validate it with a click each time (""always do this"" doesn't work).
Having a way to directly launch the external viewer would be a big step forward in usability.
@timvandermeij  it is a big issue for enterprise use, and a major issue on Mac OS X.

In the meantime, I've tried implementing a workaround. By saving the old pageNumber, it works perfectly.
Unfortunately this is a rather ugly hack, so I'm going to try to improve the code and then submit a PR.

After a discussion with @yurydelendik in [#1875](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/issues/1875#issuecomment-11487002), I decided to write this PR as a temporary solution. My reasoning was that it's better to at least have partial support for `search=`, rather than none at all until this is implemented correctly.

I briefly considered implementing `search=` properly. Since it would require not only a rewrite of the search algorithm, but probably also a new UI for searching I haven't really bothered looking into it.

I think that it would be interesting to know what the official position is on this matter. Should we try to conform to the open parameter specification regarding the implementation of `search=`?

I don't believe that pdf.js must mimic every aspect of Adobe Reader, but for something as basic as page navigation it might help users if the function is similar. For me personally, either is fine.

We are entertaining the similar idea with subset of Liberty or DejaVu fonts.

@waddlesplash could you contact the GhostScript fonts' vendor to obtain the proper license to be included with Firefox and/or pdf.js?

I imagine the behaviour of the pdf reader to change - it should scroll horizontally rather than vertically and introduce a left and right navigation.

Currenlty, we support only text annotations. I think we shall consider adding other annotations (e.g. highlight, text tools) before we support reference of all annotation.

But the other changes can be kept (and also made further improvements, the css file is long so there is more space for optimization)

For me this seems to be a ""bug"" in all current browsers. We may need to list vendor prefixed selectors for optimization and better css code.

@waddlesplash so FF17 supports listing vendor prefixed selectors? Thats interesting.

2255,2012-10-15 15:54:26,"@yurydelendik, thanks for your quick response. That context helps a lot. I believe this will enable me to try PDF.js.

The problem for me was discoverability: the README.md page points to https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/examples/helloworld/hello.js without any reference to the index page you mentioned.

I would be happy to submit a patch to READEME.md or to helloworld.js, but last time I tried to submit a patch via github, it took me several days to work through the required github procedures of forking, pointing to the right repos, etc. etc. That was months ago and I'm afraid I can't justify the time expenditure with regard to my current project.

If someone would be willing to just add a comment to helloworld.js, such as the following, I believe that would fill the gap:
// See index.html in this directory for context.

2234,2012-10-15 19:51:28,"@yurydelendik ,Thanks for help.

I modified font.js as you did in your pull request and some of the characters were still broken or missing. So I set it to 0 instead of 5. It improved a bit more but it's not complete.

Indeed, I still have found 2 broken or missing characters ( from what I see) :
the É is not rendered at all or by something like ""..."" ( Very strange by the way),
the « is still replaced by ' .

I looked up in the blame of font.js as you said. I particularly looked at the 00f6f0e from notmasteryet about encoding initialization but I've some difficulties with it.
Is the order in the encoding important? I've seen that 'Eacute' is present, so why is it not encoded rightly?

@notmasteryet, maybe you could help and explain a bit about encoding?
",aurelienmayeur,yurydelendik
2234,2012-10-22 14:25:51,"Hi everyone,
thanks for your time. Indeed, it is better now.

However, I don't think it shoulb be closed.

@brendandahl , @yurydelendik , I still have the problem with the French quotation mark. But it's not all.

here is what I have.

On documents 2091, 2086 and 2094 posted by elblaf, I still have the French quotation mark issue.
Moreover, on document 2091, I also see é as È.

I also noticed not rendered accented characters on these two following documents:

http://www.filefactory.com/file/5fx6z4h2onur/n/holdupplanetaire_pdf

http://www.filefactory.com/file/7ddlarc93vpz/n/cl_1015_guide_porteur_trueye_v2_pdf

Finally, I have a client's document (sorry, i didn't managed to reproduce it for you yet and I can't give you the original) which also has a problem with the French quotation mark but also a problem with a <i>É</i> that is rendered ""..."" . This one is particularly strange for me. The accented character is replaced by another one, just like in document 2091.

BTW, @yuridelendik, om 2012-02-10, @notmasteryet made a change (number 00f6f0e0) in font.js, on lines 50 and more. It is something about various encoding initializations.

In fact, it is a list of arrays. What I would like to know is if it wouldn't require to ""just"" refactor those arrays to definitely solve the problem. Especially, the MacRomanEncoding and the WinAnsiEncoding ones.
I hope it is clearer for you this time yuridelendik. For me it is still a bit dark in here...

I didn't realize that the difference in line endings would be an issue, but using Notepad++, that problem might also be fixed now. I work with Eclipse, so I figure that I should also be able to set the line ending type there. I will look further into this.

2108,2012-09-21 06:36:22,"@waddlesplash PDF.js would probably be able to load the pdf just fine, if the inline image limit was raised, but it may also be very slow to render.

Also, quoting

> Other newsletters of similar vintage also demonstrate this issue. As I recall it, Microsoft Word 2002 was being used back then, with FreePDF XP (a Ghostscript-backed PDF printer) producing the PDF files.

The original post already says what FreePDF XP is ;P

Really the reason is what I said on my reply above: they are most probably using multiple images to render one picture as a way to implement 1bit transparency (either visible or not). It's not a loading issue, it's an internal limit that could probably be raised (I don't know enough about the reason for this limit to say that for sure).

I checked with that pdf also. 0 errors logged in either the web console or the Firebug console. Whatever is happening, it isn't happening in my work pc (Firefox15/WinXP) or my home pc (Aurora/Win7).

I only get 2 ""error"" messages in the work pc, and they are L10n messages saying the translation for the context menu items is missing for [es-ES].

Then we could confirm that this is a platform-specific issue.

If not, then could the errors be caused by other plugins/addons that I have installed?

In the screenshot below, I've resized the thumbnails panel (since no outline is available, but the general idea is the same) by hand using Firebug and it looks good, but I do not have enough knowledge of the viewer's code base to say whether or not making the rest of the layout respond to this change is do-able or not.

2039,2015-01-03 11:17:32,"Hi @yurydelendik 

I found you mentioned ""Resolves #2039"" in your first comment at https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/2196

I am still facing the same issue i.e pdf.js not working in IE9. 
pdf.js is not even working on demo page of pdf.js http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html in IE9. It doesn't renders the document there.

Is there any demo page for pdf.js working in IE9?

Is this a known issue? Is there any fix to make it work in IE9?

I have no issues in pdf rendering in IE10 and IE11.

Thanks,
Raghav

1938,2012-07-31 08:48:15,"@gigaherz Thanks. The mouse wheel stuff wouldn't be exactly what I've been aiming at, since this is more of a ""presentation"" mode / single page mode than a mere ""fullscreen"" mode. The reason for this is, that if you want to use the mouse wheel, you'll probably not be presenting anything, thus F11 / manual fullscreen migth be better suited?

Sounds weird about the slowness. Here it only take half a second or something like that. I don't think it's the implementation as it's super simple, and only calls the respective vendor provided methods for requesting fullscreen (`document.mozRequestFullScreen`)

1875,2012-10-06 18:59:01,"OK on pdfViewSetHash, thanks.

|| Also, the use case needs to specify the nth match.

This means we'd only want to highlight and ""jump to"" the 3rd or 11th or whatever occurrence of the match.

Ideas include:
1. #search=""some phrase"",3
2. #search=""some phrase""&searchocc=3

I like #1 better.

From the docs that @bf linked to:
● search=wordList Opens the Search UI and performs a search for the specified word list in the document. Matching words are highlighted in the document. The words must be enclosed in quotes and separated by spaces; for example:
#search=”word1 word2”
● Individual parameters, together with their values (separated by & or #), can be no 
greater then 32 characters in length.
● You cannot use the reserved characters =, #, and &. There is no way to escape these 
special characters.

So it seems like pdf.js find searches for the whole string, while the PDF open parameters seem to suggest it searches on each work.  ie. pdf.js searches on ""inner loop"" while PDF open searches for either ""inner"" or ""loop"". If I understand this correctly, thoughts on reconciling the behaviors?

PS Even in the online demo, sometimes command-F (I'm on a Mac) brings up Chrome's search and not pdf.js'.

About the ""Unpackaged extension"" just clone the repository and make a chrome build:



And now open Chrome -> chrome://extensions -> Check ""Developer Mode"" -> Load unpackaged extension

If we decide to do it internally, thus dropping the Chrome dependency (which I'd be glad to do), I too think we should implement it in ""pure"" node to limit the amount of dependencies for this project.

1814,2012-06-15 12:09:44,"Uh, I'm afraid I just learned that a CRX extension is in fact _not_ just a .zip file, but a sort of ""signed"" zip file with a special header: http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/packaging.html

It shouldn't be any problem to implement that special packaging, but I don't think that it makes any sense that each developer create their own ""unique"" extension with PEM keys just to pack it. This should probably be done by the bot, the same way it happens for the .xpi Firefox extension.

@brendandahl: Packaging looks pretty easy, either we'd use chrome to pack it:

@Moistly, want to try fixing this one? Just look at the line here, where the ""Dummy"" shading is implemented:

https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/pattern.js#L176

Basically, it shouldn't return the string directly, but an object that has a function `getPattern()` that returns the string.

That will PDF.JS not crash. However, the dummy pattern is used because we come across a shading, that is not yet implemented in PDF.JS. Maybe you want to figure out which one we miss and implement it?

Look for section 4.6, there Shading Operator. Looks like the type 7 shading more or less requires to have type 6 shading implemented.

1664,2012-05-15 12:07:10,"@saebekassebil I'm not sure if making the `src/api.js` file more abstract is the right way to go. But I agree, that most of the code should be reusable.

In my thinking, most of the processing should happen on the server. That means, the server:
- creates a image per page with all the drawings
- the text layer information is extracted
- a string with all the text on the page is extracted

By sending the text layer information from the server to the client, the client can add the text layer, such that text-selection work well.

The problem with rendering the pages as an image on the server is to load the fonts. `node-canvas` has no support to load fonts from a file right now. See this issue: https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/issues/53.

> The reason being is that, if we could render documents in html5 canvas on the client but offload the work and processing to the server, it would make it much more compatible cross-browser and more lightweight on mobile/low-resource browsers. I recognize that the pdf.js project is not interested in dealing with that, thus the reason we are looking to launch a project that either extends pdf.js, cannibalizes it, or starts fresh if necessary.

That's another interesting approch. it would be better for mobile devices, but still rendering the pages using canvas still takes some while on a desktop PC. Therefore it's way better, but maybe still not awesome.

We're going to close this pull request for now since GPL code is not allowed in mozilla central.  There's still a possibility we can get a different license for this, but ideally we want something that is compatible with MPL.  Thanks for looking into this and it should be useful as a reference for when we implement JBIG2.

Given what I know about what unprivileged web code can do, I'm assuming that pdf.js does something along the lines of offering up the PDF with a `Content-Disposition` header... and that's affected by ""Always ask me where to save files"".

Given that ""Always ask me where to save files"" is not the default behaviour but _is_ the behaviour I selected, I feel reasonably confident in my interpretation of what's going on.

Sure!

The PDF Data is fetched using XHR/""ajax"". Therefore, if the server doesn't support cross-site access, you have to make sure you load the PDF file from the same origin/domain like the html file is served. In my case, I run the default web server using



and open the viewer at



Then, when I execute this line of JS:



it will load the PDF file at that origin and display it.

> As i am not able to understand what parameters are to be passed during calling of the function

You can leave it away. In theory you can pass in some default value, but if the file was viewed before, then the last view port status (zoom & position) is restored and the parameter ignored (at least that's what I think the code is doing...).

Let me know, if you run in issues.

Just to give you a heads-up, we've got a new UI proposal from our UX team at #1537 that we'll very likely adopt for Firefox. We're still debating if we should have only one cross-browser viewer or one FF-specific and one generic.

Not sure why it's not showing up in telemetry data. Seems like a fairly common use case. Pretty much every federal .gov (and most state gov) pdf I've seen have fillable fields.

@timvandermeij any idea how many dev hours it might take to ship something sort of usable? Like, are the input primitives and datastructs mapped, leaving mostly UI work? Or, is it more complicated than that?

It might make sense for my team to work on it, if there is a quick win.

On Firefox, this works very smooth. However, on Chrome, the UI feels more laggy then it's already with the existing text-selection-div-calculation algorithm. On the other hand, it feels laggy for a shorter time now, as the divs get added to the DOM in a shorter overall time. Not sure what's better :/

It's called in various functions/methods who all depend on each other in weird ways. Maybe you could illuminate the problem by adding a log statement to the setter - I did this while developing this code:



I know it's deprecated, and Firefox will throw some errors at you if you don't out-comment `'use strict';` but it's nonetheless a handy way to figure out how the function is being called.

Mhmm. Can someone else check if s/he can reproduce this? I tried it again and when I press the right arrow to jump over a few pages and the page then finish rendering, I see the first page.

I tried to debug what's going on, but couldn't figure it out. The `currentPageNumber` is always correct. Also, the `scrollIntoView()` calls do always the right thing. But if I check the `scrollTop` and `offsetTop` property of the viewer container, it gets set to `0` and therefore the first page is displayed, but I just can't figure out why this is the case in chrome and only in fullScreen mode.

There are some functions (like `getVisiblePages()`) that act different if `isFullscreen` is enabled. But the returned stuff looks reasonable.

Using `git bisect`, this seems to have regressed in PR #3209.

**Edit:** The failure happens here: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/fonts.js#L4700.
For MMType1 fonts `this.glyphNameMap` isn't defined, which causes `this.glyphNameMap[glyphName]` to return an error. I think you could get away with just changing line 4700 from:
`fontCharCode = this.glyphNameMap[glyphName] ||`
to:
`fontCharCode = (this.glyphNameMap && this.glyphNameMap[glyphName]) ||`.

I don't really know anything about the font rendering in pdf.js, so I assume that this probably is a much to simple solution.

you're right - the difference is about downloading everything against downloading only parts. However, as much as I can think about it in pure theory without having done any implementation yet, there shouldn't be too much difference in the way this gets implemented.

several reasons

chrome's font rendering (at least on mac) is slightly broken, occasionally certain lines will get corrupted / have the characters corrupted until the line is out of the screen view and scrolled back into view, and then they're again rendered correctly, But even then compared with eg how the same pdf might be rendered by preview or when printed, things look subtly wrong.

another difference is that (and this applies to pretty much every other viewer in browser), it seems  with pdf js I can open internal document or web links in a new tab (if I want to), which means that I can continue reading at the current spot, but essentialy have my finger (so to speak) on the linked location to refer to as I please. (most other readers that work in browser only allow changing the current tab to the new location, no right click / open link in new tab support).  

Also its suprisingly snappy overall, and I think it has better memory residency than some other viewers, but i've not benchmarked it.

1170,2012-03-12 11:07:43,"@brendandahl Definitely makes sense, but also definitely something that still needs to be addressed in the addon in the long term.

First, it's a bad PR move because, from the perspective of a NoScript user who doesn't know your motivation, PDF.js is written by security novices who can't (or are too lazy to) figure out how addons like Greasemoney execute scripts regardless of NoScript permissions.

Second, it's possibly counter-productive from a security standpoint for the PDF viewer to require the user to whitelist the entire site for arbitrary JavaScript execution... especially if the user is using the default NoScript behaviour of letting the JavaScript whitelist also control execution of potentially-exploitable plugins like the Java runtime.

Also, wouldn't this approach potentially **enable** exploits along these lines?
1. A site allows PDF upload because they expect a PDF plugin like Adobe's or FoxIt's which, I hope, keep themselves reasonably separate from the browser's execution context for the hosting site.
2. Someone uploads a specially-crafted PDF.
3. A hole in pdf.js results in exploit JavaScript in the resulting pdf.js view.
4. Because the PDF was loaded in the site context, that JavaScript can attack a site which wasn't expecting attacks via PDF.

Is there some special reason you can't implement the plugin this way?
1. The add-on creates a JavaScript sandbox completely independent of any Chrome component or domain out on the web.
2. The add-on retrieves the PDF itself. (or, perhaps, sets up some kind of ready-made handle for pdf.js to read from)
3. The add-on injects pdf.js and the PDF into the sandbox so that, even if the PDF does exploit a hole in pdf.js, there's nothing else it has permission to access.

The only thing I don't like is, that this patch breaks if the UI and the value stored in `.currentScaleValue` get out of sync. That's why I've proposed to check the `currentScaleValue` if it is a string value or not (`currentScaleValue == 'page-width' || currentScaleValue == 'page-fit' || currentScaleValue == 'auto'`).

However, if this fixes the bug and you think it's not worth changing it further, let's merge it.

One thing I've noticed is, that you save the current `window.pageYOffset` value to store the scroll position.

The other source code is ICU4J (http://site.icu-project.org/). But it's a lot of code - the normalization module is about 465Kb.

- Adding the missing `selectScaleOption` function.
- Fix treatment for the 'zoom' parameter. The problem here was, that the setting backend as well as the hash-creating code uses the `PDFView.currentScale` property, which is the parsed scale as a number (1.0 = 100% zoom). However, to recover the actual last state, it is required to store the `value` passed to `parseScale`. E.g, the zoom level to recover from the setting might not be ""100%"" but ""page-width"". Therefore, it was required to store the `value` passed to `parseScale`, which is done on the `PDFView.currentScaleValue`.
  Next, the value used to store on the hash and setting was multiplied by `100`, to get the `%` value. This worked as long as the selected zoom level wasn't something with a string (e.g. `pageWidth`). I fixed stuff to work with strings now as well. This required some ""normalization"" to multiply the internal zoom level by 100 if, and only if, it's a number and not a string.

@brendandahl Can you please run the tests below on your Win VM?

On OS X `Date.now()` is the clear winner, but if we're lucky there's an equally fast solution on Windows we can use. (Though that would lead to platform-dependent solutions... yuck).

From that list, I've removed all commands, that have a predictable execution time and that should execute fast (e.g. `save` and `restore` just call one JS function `ctx.save()` and `ctx.restore()` - that shouldn't take up long). For commands I wasn't sure, I looked at the implementation and looked up if there might be a case, where it depends on some more time expensive object (like a shading fill), that could result in long execution time.

For people coming to the project, they might look at the viewer.html file to get a basic understanding on how things are working. Therefore, I think the viewer.html file should be as simple as possible to understand.

@arturadib, we could mabye add the script tags at the bottom during builds (extension, ...)? As this pull request is about thumbnail rendering, there should be another pull request for doing this script tag change if we agree on doing it.

This has a dependency on java. As we use java to lint our files already, that should be all fine.

@kkujala, can you add a new ""task"" in the main makefile, such that one can run `make unit` like we can do `make test` right now? Should `make test` run `make unit` by default?

Yep that does it, though we still have the profile issue. This could be fixed in the future though.

However, I'm not sure we're in a position to include `unit-test` in our `make test` suite, so perhaps you can leave that out of the `test` section of the `Makefile`? In the future when we have meaningful tests we might want to add that in.

I think we should name the ""class"" the same way it's exposed. That means naming it `RefSet` and not `RefSetConstructor`, because that might confuse people as we speak about the same thing. If you're debugging, you will see the string `RefSet` then, which is also smaller.

JpegImage.domImage is return through an accessor (JpegImage.getImage) so 
it sounds to me that it is a private property and _ is the hint I used

703,2011-11-03 17:44:43,"Thinking about this patch again, when I've implemented the worker code, Chris pointed out he wants everything than can run on a worker to be in one file. E.g. the jobs for font translation, IR creating etc should go in one file and get loaded on a worker at once and not spawn a new worker for each separate task.

The idea there was, that each worker can do every task and we implement some kind of scheduler, that priorities all jobs and then sends them to the workers. As all workers are the same, there is no problem in sending any job to any worker.

@notmasteryet, what do you think about this? Can we call the CMYK Jpeg image processing code within the PartialEvaluator, such that the data send to the main thread is already ready to go and we don't have to send it to another worker? That looks easier for me as we don't have to manage another worker. It's of course slower, as we process everything in a single worker for now, but I have a big TODO item to split the current worker processing code up to use multiple workers and then this shouldn't be hard to get into that infrastructure as well.

The `build/pdf.js` file is great for deployment, but should we really build everything in just one file when developing as well? For debugging purpose, it's way easier (and more speedy!) to have a lot of separate files. That also makes it easier to navigate, as you know you're hacking right now on file x, line y but if everything gets compressed into one big file, you don't know the line numbers anymore.

From my own experience, I spend quite some time in the debugger, so we should make sure that interaction is as easy/speedy as possible.

For Bespin/Skywriter, the build process ripped out all the `/src/` links and replaced them with with only one src link. Can we do something similar here?

635,2011-10-14 03:50:08,"@jvierek I apologize for the lag again.  I've barely been keeping my head above water lately.

Architecturally, this approach still looks fine; looks like it hasn't changed from the previous patch.  The fixes you've made look good.  It looks like the comments about file organization weren't addressed, and I think Artur was confused similarly to me.  We need to figure that part out.

As for landing, I mostly agree with @arturadib's comments above.  We should land this with a functional worker backend.  When this architecture runs only on the main thread, I think we'll mostly regress throughput without much responsiveness gain, though there are some pdfs it could improve.

@arturadib @brendandahl @notmasteryet how well do you guys understand the architecture these patches are moving towards?  One thing we neglected in the previous pull request was getting the core devs on the same page; it's important because this change will permeate a lot of pdf.js, and affect the way patches need to be written.  I think the first ""action item"" is to make sure the new architecture is documented and understood.  @jvierek, want to start with a write-up and then post the link to the mailing list?

Next, we should figure out how the worker backend will interact with the code reorganization being planned (I haven't been following the details).  Maybe you guys could conf call next week to discuss?

With both of those settled, I think it'll be clearer how to get the current patch here ready to land, and it may make sense to distribute some work so that everyone gets a feel for the new backend.

Sound good?

> If the main problem now is that the UI sometimes freezes, a single all-in-one worker might do the trick - that way we don't have to break up the objects and deal with dependencies, etc. Have we tried this simpler solution yet to see if it solves our problem?

Yes, that entirely solves the responsiveness problem.  It doesn't mean we don't have to deal with dependencies: we still have to wait on fonts and images to load.  I'm not sure that a lot of lines of code could be removed from this patch, but it's likely that it could be made conceptually simpler.  Next week may be a good time to figure that out.

> Going for more than one worker today will only benefit a very small fraction of the market as most computers have 1-2 cores anyway. In fact, if we launch more workers than the number of cores things might actually slow down due to the message-passing and context-switching overhead. (I guess this will require some browser hacks to detect the # of cores).

Everyone (to a first approximation) has at least 2 HW threads, phones being the exception for the moment.  I wouldn't be surprised if 4 (dual-core+HT) is more common than 2 nowadays.  You're right that scheduling work is hard.  That's a bridge we'll have to cross, and we may need new platform support.  But we need to be able to scale up to more HW threads: that's where perf wins for this kind of code will come from from now on.  That doesn't mean we should neglect other wins like parallel rendering of individual pages, or same-page optimizations like SIMD.

635,2011-10-14 15:58:06,"Hey Chris, thanks so much for making time for this!

> I think the first ""action item"" is to make sure the new architecture is documented and understood.

That would be extremely helpful. I know that this will be hard no matter what, but since it'll affect the overall architecture of the code it'd be nice to be able to understand the big picture first.

Big thanks to Julian for plowing along and making so much progress already. Because of his work we will all be in a better position to help and make a more educated decision.

> Next, we should figure out how the worker backend will interact with the code reorganization being planned

Right, since we'll be working on this already next week, maybe @jviereck can postpone writing code until after we're done? 

@jviereck Meanwhile, as per Chris's suggestion, perhaps you can open an issue like #646 explaining the overall architecture and what files will be affected, to gather feedback?

> Everyone (to a first approximation) has at least 2 HW threads, phones being the exception for the moment. I wouldn't be surprised if 4 (dual-core+HT) is more common than 2 nowadays.

Makes sense. I guess it'd be helpful to quantify this a bit better, so I've filed a bug with the metrics team:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=694565

As to HTs, beyond freeing up the UI with one additional thread, the benefit from using them remains to be seen, as although they mitigate context-switching, there's still execution-switching and message-passing overhead. In other words, launching a total of 4 threads because we have 2 cores + 2 HTs might be slower than launching only 2. I suppose we won't know until we try!

Speaking of which...

@cgjones Do you know if we can access the # of cores available via XPCOM or some other browser-specific method? I've found some threads regarding the spec of Web Workers but nothing concrete yet:

540,2011-09-27 20:56:20,"Hi @arturadib.

I'm a developer that uses jQuery in all web developments. I am integrated the pdf.js library inside my software SaltOS. It's easy to do and I understand that now, the most important issues are fix all pending bugs. 

Please, provide what type of interface do you want for integrate the pdf.js with jQuery???. The good thing is that the pdf.js provides an abstract of features and you can program your ""pdf online reader"" as you need. For example:
- The ""$.pdfDoc()"" need the url to access to the PDF, the data stream or bufferArray?
- This constructor, is a wrapper to the ""new PDFDoc(data) only?
- The canvas used to render the pages is provided by the jQuery caller or the plugin must create all needed canvas?
- You want to render 1 or 2 or all pages?
- if you resize the viewer, want you to re-render the canvas?
- You need previews for each page?

I understand that program a jQuery plugin is more complex that the plugin provided by CKEditor (as an example) that only has 1 action: convert the textarea into a rich editor.

I can help you programing a jQuery wrapper for pdf.js, but is needed that previously, we define all features that must provide, allowing the user that uses this jQuery plugin to do the same things that without the jQuery plugin.

529,2011-09-27 15:50:32,"I agree we definitely need to work on our global namespace pollution. But I'm with Chris in that requireJS might not necessarily be the best solution.

The simplest solution I can think of is to wrap the entire code in a self-executing function/single global object, and only expose the necessary API objects to the global namespace.

As to working with more files, I'm with Chris on this too -- I prefer working with fewer, which means less maintenance/gluing overhead. (Incidentally, since we already have a substantial number of required scripts, we should start encouraging folks to adopt the `defer` attribute when loading our scripts: http://davidwalsh.name/html5-async).

@brendandahl: Here are a couple of tricks I use for working with long files in TextMate:

""Where was I working just then?""  Do a quick undo-redo. The cursor will be placed where you made your last change.

""Where is this class/variable declared?""  Cmd+Shift-T. Or, since we have a convention for class declarations of the type ""var Class = ..."", search for e.g. ""stream ="" or ""pdfdoc ="".

You can also try Sublime Text, which Bill recommended. It has a global view/map of the file. Never used it though; maybe @wfwalker has some thoughts on whether it's useful for large files.

TypoAscender and Descender are used by applications to calculate the correct line spacing. Since the font is only being used to render PDFs these values are not relevant. But, if we are to allow editing of PDFs then it is better to set it to a properly scaled ascent and descent from properties.

> I've been looking at this on and off too. Overall I like it but the one thing that worries me is having all the duplicated functions for workers/nonworkers e.g. WorkerPage.width() and Page.width() etc. The classical inheritance programmer in me wants to make an interface at least so they don't get out of sync.

You're right and there should definitely be a followup issue to merge WorkerPage with the normal Page. For the simpelness of implementation and not breaking too many things at once, I've done it by adding the WorkerPage that calls some of the Page functions but handle some functions (like the rendering) different.

> Another approach I've seen is you handle the worker and a regular object the same but then you have do everything through a message function with callbacks which can get ugly.

Callbacks are common in JS. There might be other approaches to this, that don't use callbacks, but I like the way it is right now as it ensures we use most of the same code path for the worker and non-worker situation. This requires two more function calls/closures then we need, but for me its worth having them then splitting the code up in two different code paths.

Does that sound reasonable to you? Is there another point why you think this can get ""ugly""?

123,2011-08-08 13:16:05,"So I agree with most of the above. I like jviereck's idea that the partial evaluator should compute as much as possible, basically removing pdf specific code (such as fetching parameters, decoding streams, etc...) and leaving only canvas specific commands.

I don't think its necessary to flatten the command stream (and this wouldn't work for tiling command streams). But we can rethink this decision later.

So one thing that seems to differ between @jviereck and @cgjones is that jviereck seems to want to parallelize the partial evaluation of the command stream while cjones approach is to process the command stream sequentially while spinning off large tasks which can run in parallel.

I'm not sure I grok the difference you're pointing out here.  Can you elaborate a bit?

A hazard of creating a single merged command stream as I believe is being proposed above is that it will force the processing of independent substreams (""Do"", tiling, etc.) to be sequential.  We want to process those in parallel when the tradeoffs are right.

It appears that PR #5655 wasn't quite general enough to handle all possible cases of empty `Kids` nodes, and from a cursory look at this issue I'm not seeing an immediate way to fix it.
(Well, just getting rid of [src/core/obj.js#L497-L508](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/cf73f4bc2ddd13f73f4116fb60dc568a0d90dcae/src/core/obj.js#L497-L508) would do the trick.

For some environments that might be a problem, hence this patch refactors that to instead use a factory to load built-in CMaps on the main thread and message the data to the worker thread.

This is inspired by other recent work, e.g. the addition of the `CanvasFactory`, and to a large extent on the IRC discussion starting at http://logs.glob.uno/?c=mozilla%23pdfjs&s=12+Oct+2016&e=12+Oct+2016#c53010.

*Please note:* While it certainly may be possible to improve the patch, it does work just fine locally as-is, i.e. the viewer still works and all unit/font/reference tests pass.

@yurydelendik Since this PR attempts to implement your idea from http://logs.glob.uno/?c=mozilla%23pdfjs&s=12+Oct+2016&e=12+Oct+2016#c53018, I'd appreciate if you could provide feedback on the implementation when you've got time.

***Edit:*** Based on this PR, we should e.g. be able to get the CMap unit-tests running on Travis, by providing a custom Node.js factory for the unit-test.

***Edit 2:*** Also fixes #4794, courtesy of the second commit.

8047,2017-03-12 22:10:36,"I did more debugging for this and managed to trace the problem to `src/display/canvas.js`. The problem is that a `setFillRGBColor(255, 255, 255)` operation is done, but not reset when the annotations are drawn. This makes the checkmarks appear white instead of black, but they are in the correct position. When I manually add `this.setFillRGBColor(0, 0, 0)` in `CanvasGraphics_beginAnnotation`, the checkmarks are displayed correctly.

I'm not sure why this happens though. For each annotation, we do a save/restore of the state. However, in the stepper these saves/restores are not always shown. Moreover, when saving/restoring we copy the previous state (also the one on `this.ctx`), so if the color is set to white and not reset anywhere else, it remains white. So, in short, I suspect that save/restore does not work properly here, but I'm missing the final piece of the puzzle to solve it. Either another operation is not saving/restoring the state properly, or saving/restoring does not take the fill color into account properly.

@Snuffleupagus Could you test this on Windows to see if the bot is just wrong or if the text form fields really do not render anymore?

@yurydelendik Do you have any idea what can cause this? Maybe we should manually update the Windows bot to Firefox 53 to see if that works out?",timvandermeij,yurydelendik

@yurydelendik, `viewer.html` consumes the module version of `viewer.js` now. Sometimes it is required the window with a PDF.js viewer will show a PDF only at a later stage in page's lifecycle. For example, a customer requirement: the user gives his/her consent to view a PDF file on the PDF viewer page itself; only users that have explicitly agreed can view the PDF; user consent is audited and logged. Another example: using PDF.js as a part of a tabbed page, without an `iframe`; only display a PDF, when you switch to the PDF viewer tab. I am pretty sure that 1) breaking the hardcoded dependency on the `DOMContentLoaded` event, 2) introducing a mechanism of a manual bootstrap of the PDF.js viewer, and 3) tidying up the global scope even more brings its benefit in a vast majority of development scenarios.

I hope you'd agree. Thank you in advance.",sindilevich,Snuffleupagus

7897,2016-12-15 20:42:22,"*Please note that most of the necessary code adjustments were made in PR #7890.*

ESLint has a number of advantageous properties, compared to JSHint. Among those are:
 - The ability to find subtle bugs, thanks to more rules (e.g. PR 7881).
 - Much more customizable in general, and many rules allow fine-tuned behaviour rather than the just the on/off rules in JSHint.
 - Many more rules that can help developers avoid bugs, and a lot of rules that can be used to enforce a consistent coding style. The latter should be particularily useful for new contributors (and reduce the amount of stylistic review comments necessary).
 - The ability to easily specify exactly what rules to use/not to use, as opposed to JSHint which has a default set. *Note:* in future JSHint version some of the rules we depend on will be removed, according to warnings in http://jshint.com/docs/options/, so we wouldn't be able to update without losing lint coverage.
 - More easily disable one, or more, rules temporarily. In JSHint this requires using a numeric code, which isn't very user friendly, whereas in ESLint the rule name is simply used instead.

By default there's no rules enabled in ESLint, but there are some default rule sets available. However, to prevent linting failures if we update ESLint in the future, it seemed easier to just explicitly specify what rules we want.
Obviously this makes the ESLint config file somewhat bigger than the old JSHint config file, but given how rarely that one has been updated over the years I don't think that matters too much.

I've tried, to the best of my ability, to ensure that we enable the same rules for ESLint that we had for JSHint. Furthermore, I've also enabled a number of rules that seemed to make sense, both to catch possible errors *and* various style guide violations.

Despite the ESLint README claiming that it's slower that JSHint, https://github.com/eslint/eslint#how-does-eslint-performance-compare-to-jshint, locally this patch actually reduces the runtime for `gulp` lint (by approximately 20-25%).

A couple of stylistic rules that would have been nice to enable, but where our code currently differs to much to make it feasible:
 - `comma-dangle`, controls trailing commas in Objects and Arrays (among others).
 - `object-curly-spacing`, controls spacing inside of Objects.
 - `spaced-comment`, used to enforce spaces after `//` and `/*. (This is made difficult by the fact that there's still some usage of the old preprocessor left.)

Rules that I indend to look into possibly enabling in follow-ups, if it seems to make sense: `no-else-return`, `no-lonely-if`, `brace-style` with the `allowSingleLine` parameter removed.

7890,2016-12-13 00:13:38,"I've been looking into switching to ESLint, which I mentioned on IRC about a year ago and have finally had time to actually do now, since it's got a number of benefits compared to JSHint[1]. Among those are:
rules that can help find subtle bugs (e.g. PR #7881), a lot more (fine-grained) options, the ability to enforce larger parts of the style guide, more modern and thus easier to work with. (Also, locally `gulp lint` actually seems to run ~25% quicker when using ESLint instead of JSHint.)

In order to be able to make the switch, and to enable a decent amount of rules from the start, I figured that one big PR that both changes the linter *and* fixes various new linting failures would be unnecessarily big and thus time consuming to review.
Hence I'm submitting this PR which addresses a bunch of linting issue found by ESLint first, to make the PR that actually changes the linter somewhat smaller and simpler to review. (I'm hoping to have time to finish it up, and submit the actual ESLint PR this weekend.)

@yurydelendik I took your approach and created a slightly more efficient version. When you told me to eliminate the inner cycle I didn't really know if you meant what I wrote or creating a pre-mapping array.

In this next table, baseline is your code and current is my commit:

| browser | stat | Count | Baseline(ms) | Current (ms) | +/- | % |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Firefox | Overall | 20 | 113| 103| -10| -9.09 |
| Firefox | Page Request | 20 | 12 | 9 | -3 | -22.50|
| Firefox | Rendering | 20 | 101 | 93 | -7| -7.46 |

I don't know if my testing conditions were different than the initial commit, because these values are higher than the ones I first posted... But testing with my first commit, this code was 14% faster.

Also, about the PhotometricInterpreation thing, I'll try to test it, but I'm having problems:

7632,2016-09-14 08:35:25,"I intended to provide proper benchmarking results here, as outlined in https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Benchmarking-your-changes, but after wasting a couple of hours over the weekend getting weird results I gave up.
It appears that there's a lot of, i.e. way too much, variance between subsequent runs of `text` tests for the results to be meaningful.
(Previously I've only benchmarked `eq` tests, so I don't know if the `text` tests has never worked well or if it's a newer problem. For reference, please see the results of back-to-back benchmark runs on the current `master` with a _very_ simple manifest file: [https://gist.github.com/Snuffleupagus/eec3acc22f519eddce6404be883b6960](https://gist.github.com/Snuffleupagus/eec3acc22f519eddce6404be883b6960).)

Instead I used `console.time/timeEnd` in `appendText` and `expandTextDivs` to be able to compare the performance with/without the patch. The entire viewer was (skip-cache) reloaded between measurements, and the result are available here: [https://gist.github.com/Snuffleupagus/33fc971b653e6524bc889216ff95499c](https://gist.github.com/Snuffleupagus/33fc971b653e6524bc889216ff95499c).
Given the troubles I've had with benchmarking, I've not yet computed any statistics on the results (e.g. mean, variance, confidence intervals, and so on).
However, just by looking at the data I think it's safe to say that this patch first of all doesn't seem to regress the current performance. Secondly it certainly looks _very_ likely that this patch actually improves the performance, especially for the one-glyph-per-text-div case (cf. issue 7224).

7602,2016-09-06 20:42:46,"This patch is the first step towards implementing support for interactive forms (AcroForms). It makes it possible to render text widget annotations exactly like Adobe Reader/Acrobat.

Everything we implement for AcroForms is disabled by default using a preference, mainly because it is not ready to use yet, but has to implemented in many steps to avoid complexity. The preference allows us to work with the code while not exposing the behavior by default. Mainly storing entered values and printing them is still absent, which would be minimal requirements for enabling this by default. The default behavior is therefore unchanged.

You can test the functionality using http://web.archive.org/web/20110918100215/http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf (from https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/test/pdfs/f1040.pdf.link) and setting the preference `renderInteractiveForms` to `true`.

@Snuffleupagus Could you review this PR? I talked to Yury on IRC and he agreed that the preference approach is most useful here so we can iterate on this.

7596,2016-09-05 22:03:27,"Currently, we only support text widget annotations (field type 'Tx') partially. However, the current code does not make this entirely clear and does not provide a warning when an unsupported field type is encountered, making it harder to determine why rendering fails.

Moreover, in the display layer we make no distinction between the various types of widget annotations, causing the code for text widget annotations to also be executed for other types of widget annotations in a fallback situation.

This patch improves the structure of the widget annotation code. In the core layer, we use the same structure we use for non-widget annotations in the factory and provide a clear warning when an unsupported type is encountered. In the display layer, we do the same and split the `WidgetAnnotationElement` class into two classes, namely `TextWidgetAnnotationElement` for text widget annotations and `WidgetAnnotationElement` for other unsupported annotations as a
fallback. From this it clear that we only support text widget annotations and nothing else.

@Snuffleupagus Since you previously reviewed annotation PRs, would you be willing to review this one as well? I have follow-up ideas that depend on this refactoring to make the code more understandable. The check at https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/7596/files#diff-1097e3b131ba22f8e8a6c2f20e3ab5ecL395 has been removed because it is unnecessary. It is not required to have a field value for rendering, for example for text boxes in forms with no prefilled value, which is really common and for which this patch prepares the code. Appearance streams are already ignored in the core layer, so there is no need to check for this either in the display layer.

The following documents may be used for testing this. Rendering should be equal before and after this patch, but the button and signature documents should now both have a similar message in the console.
- Signature: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5681461/dev/test-signature.pdf

I somewhat confused about complexity of the proposed solution. We just need part that:
- extracts filename from the Content-Disposition header (we don't need to throw, just ignore incorrect headers)
- pass it to the PDF loading task result (if the header is set)
- adjust title in `pdfDocument.getMetadata().then(...)` (if the header set)

Rest of the patch just adds a complexity for the reviewer(s).

@anoopelias can you simplify patch to just keep only logic and tests need to address the items above?

I prefer ""clean room"" implementation. IHMO we just need couple of regular expressions (and not full parser) and tests to verify that.

Continuing the work by @yurydelendik, I'm attempting to get his commit into shape to be included in the library. So far, I've converted his feature into an option that is set when defining the PDFViewerApplication, and have run some preliminary testing. 
# Performance Testing

So far I have tested 2 aspects of performance in Chrome. Memory/CPU usage, and the time taken to render text layers and set the text content, as previously logged by Yury. I chose 5 PDFs that vary in size, amount of text, and complexity to try to get a wide base of results. I've attached excel documents of my findings, and I'll summarize them here.

Here are the files I've used for testing so far: 
[pdfs.zip](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/files/415937/pdfs.zip)
## CPU and Memory Testing

This was done with a modification of a script provided by Yury that logs CPU and Memory usage every 300 ms. Additionally, I wrote an apple script to simulate scrolling on the browser. First scrolling up, then down, then jumping to the last page and scrolling up. This allows me to replicate and time the results from the script. The scripts can be found here: https://github.com/jeremypress/browser-testing/tree/master. Below are some graphs comparing usage between the two branches. There seems to be a negligible difference in CPU and Memory, but further testing may determine otherwise.

## Render Times

Data on render times was logged using console.time statements written by Yury. Here is where the performance difference between the two branches can be noted. On text heavy files, render times can be as much as twice a slow, which would correlate to around a half second increase in total rendering time spent. Also, in some cases the fairexpand branch requires a small amount of extra divs to be rendered. However, this does not really impact first impression, as most of the rendering is done as a user moves to a new page. A sample of the data is provided below, and the full file is attached.

## Handling rtl and rotated/vertical text

Overall I've noticed that this enhancement handles rtl selection fine, and generally reduces flickering on rotated text. Although there are some instances of rotated text where fairexpand makes it harder or impossible to select, these are already problem areas on the master branch. Attached are some videos showing the differences, and screenshots of the text divs on a document with vertical text.

# Concerns
1. Chrome is the only browser I've tested in so far, what other data is desired in order to determine if the commit is performant enough?
2. Is the option implemented correctly according to the design of the project?
3. I'm failing a unit test regarding rendering PDF's in parallel. However, this also happens on my master branch, so it could be due to my testing environment. 
   
   Feedback is greatly appreciated so I can make improvements going forward.

7440,2016-06-25 09:53:19,"There are PDF generators which create destinations with e.g. too large top values, which cause the wrong page to be scrolled into view because the offset becomes negative.
By ignoring negative offsets, we can prevent this issue, and get a similar behaviour as in Adobe Reader.

However, since we're also using `PDFViewer_scrollPageIntoView` in more cases than just when links (in the document/outline) are clicked, the patch adds a way to allow the caller to opt-out of this behaviour.
In e.g. the following situations, I think that we still want to be able to allow negative offsets: when restoring a position from the `ViewHistory`, when the `viewBookmark` button is used to obtain a link to the current position, or when maintaining the current position on zooming.

Rather than adding another parameter to `PDFViewer_scrollPageIntoView`, I've changed the signature to take an parameter object instead. To maintain backwards compatibility, I've added fallback code enclosed in a `GENERIC` preprocessor tag.

I see what you mean about reusability for the snippet; along with @Snuffleupagus's comment about keeping build-specific style rules in the snippet, I'll move these styles back into the HTML. As far as reusability of CSS styles, however, this seems like a little bit of a conflict. Would you prefer it if the snippet continued to live wholly on its own, with its own style rules? I can copy and paste the styles for the overlayContainer and dialog and write them into the scoped style tag, but these styles would definitely be less DRY as a result.

The PDF file is generated by `Scribus PDF`, which for reasons I cannot understand is placing redundant `Tf` commands before _every_ showText command.
Note how the PDF file also contains lots of (basically) identical fonts, but with slightly different names, which causes unnecessary font-switching. This causes some unnecessary breaking of textLayer div's, but this issue cannot be easily worked around.

7386,2016-06-06 14:49:47,"Before we attempt to upstream that patch, I think that it would really help if we made a decision about the _minimum_ Firefox version that we intend to support with the development addon.

Currently we've got quite a bit of fallback code for fairly old Firefox versions in `PdfStreamConverter.jsm` (and `PdfjsChromeUtils.jsm`), and given the lack of testing, I wouldn't be surprised if the development addon is already semi-broken in older Firefox versions.

My suggestion is thus that we should limit support for the development addon to the _currently shipping_ ESR version, which as of this writing is `45`. This would considerably reduce the amount of necessary fallback code, and greatly simplify testing.

Note how it's not possible to show the various Popup Annotations in the above document.
To fix that, this patch lets the Popup inherit the flags of the parent, in the special case where the parent is `viewable` _and_ the Popup is not.
In general, I don't think that a Popup must have the same flags set as the parent. However, it seems very strange to have a `viewable` parent annotation, and then not being able to view the Popup.

Annoyingly the PDF specification doesn't, as far as I can find, mention anything about how this case should be handled, but this patch seem consistent with the actual behaviour in Adobe Reader.

@timvandermeij How do you feel about this patch? Should we consider fixing this edge-case, or are we more worried about breakage elsewhere.

Tested with Chrome 50 as follows:
1. Build the Chrome extension (`node make chromium`).
2. Load the extension at chrome://extensions.
3. Open the options page, right-click and choose Inspect element to open Chrome's devtools and run the following snippet in the console (to simulate the behavior before this PR):
   `storageAreaName = 'local'; storageArea = chrome.storage.local;`
4. Change some preferences in the options page.
5. Close the options page and re-open it. You will observe that the settings are back to their defaults (because the settings at step 3 and 4 are saved to storage.local).
6. Inspect the background page and reload it (e.g. by running `location.reload()` from the console).
7. Confirm that the background page shows ""Successfully migrated preferences from local to sync storage.""
8. Repeat step 6 (i.e. reload the background page).
9. Confirm that no extra messages are printed (i.e. there is nothing to migrate since the last migration succeeded).

With the above steps, you can verify that the migration logic works as intended. Now, also test whether the preferences are actually applied:
1. Visit the options page of the extension at chrome://extensions
2. Untick the ""Activate Hand tool by default"" checkbox.
3. Open any PDF file, e.g. http://www.orimi.com/pdf-test.pdf
4. Press the mouse and move it around.
5. Confirm that text is being selected (=handtool is disabled).
6. Go back to the options page, and check the ""Activate Hand tool by default"" checkbox.
7. Repeat step 3 and 4.
8. Confirm that the page is moved up and down (=handtool is enabled). (If your screen is big then the page fits on one page, in that case just zoom in or resize the window so that the page doesn't fit in the viewport).

Fixes #7325.

@timvandermeij Since you asked in https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/6272#issuecomment-189018446 if the second commit could be submitted in a separate PR, I've done that here. Would you be willing to try and review this?
Since it's been awhile since I wrote that patch, when getting back to it I found that there were actually a number of (existing) issues present, which I've tried to account for. Unfortunately, that means this is now quite a bit larger than originally, but I've tried to add unit-tests for all API/core changes.

7297,2016-05-07 10:38:03,"Using http://brendandahl.github.io/pdf.js.utils/browser/ to browser the contents of this PDF file, you'll find that (most of) the regular _and_ bold text actually uses the exact _same_ font.

The explanation for why some parts of the text are bold, and others are not, is that the PDF file utilizes `Text rendering modes` to simulate bold text.
For the normal text `0 Tr` (== Fill) is used, and for the bold text `2 Tr` (== Fill, then stroke) is used; please refer to section 9.3.6 of the PDF specification[1].
By using the same colour for both the fill and stroke operations, this creates the appearance of a bold font. This seems like a very uncommon way the create a bold font, and I cannot remember seeing it before, since virtually all other PDF files uses separate fonts for regular and bold text.

This unfortunately means that the issue as stated, i.e. `page.getTextContent() loses fontName transitions but viewer renders correctly`, isn't valid since the PDF file _does not_ actually change the font name.

One way to solve this issue could be to also add the current `Text rendering mode` to the data returned by `getTextContent`, e.g. something along these lines: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/compare/master...Snuffleupagus:issue-7297
@yurydelendik Does the above seem reasonable? If so, I'll submit a PR with tests.

7010,2016-04-13 13:43:49,"I have rebased the patch with the master. Phew! 

I am able to reproduce this issue your talking about as well. I hope we would be able to close this soon.

**Update:**
@timvandermeij, @Snuffleupagus, I think I have found the bug related to the above mentioned issue. After opening any pdf file, `visibleView` is equal to the last set value (say 0, sidebar closed), then if you will open the sidebar, the value of the `visibleView` will change. (to say 1, Thumbnail view). Now, if you will change the view to Outline, `visibleView` does not change to 2, but it should. However, at this time, if one would close the sidebar and then reopen, the value of the `visibleView` is successfully changed to 2.

Thus, during @timvandermeij testing, he is getting the same `visibleView` that was set before, but it's not the right view because the value of `visibleView` didn't change with the transition from Thumbnail->Outline view or Outline->Thumbnail view.

Upon further testing, I found out that the pdf_sidebar is behaving as expected and the active view is getting changed during the transition, however the ``updateviewarea` event if not fired during the transition from Thumbnail->Outline view or Outline->Thumbnail view. Thus, the current view is not getting saved in case of a transition. Is there any other event fired during such a transition which we can use to set the sidebarView value as current view.

What do you think? Please let me know. Thanks.

Initially I thought my issues with the Scribus PDF exports were fixed by #6068. That issue is still fixed, so this is not a regression, but something must have changed in the meantime (either in Scribus or in my system fonts) because, as far as I can remember, this new PDF is generated in the _exact_ same way as the one in that issue, yet this one is broken and the other one is not.

Occurs when I try to cancel existing transfer.

Seems `messageHandler` keeps receiving 'obj' messages even after `destroy()`. But `pageCache` object has been flushed already, so line 2915 `if (pageProxy.objs.hasData(id)) {` throws an error above.

`chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/http://example.com/test.pdf`

This is a bug for following reasons:
- It forces the user to manually select part of the tab URL to copy the PDF URL somewhere else.
- It breaks bookmarks of PDF URLs. The user may want to revert to default PDF viewer.

Can the URL be the actual URL of the PDF file as it is in the screenshot of the extension on Chrome Web Store?

I'm also adding https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14396356/force-firefox-to-render-empty-image-within-dimensions-specified-by-css for more documentation on how to possibly solve this. From that page it appears that this issue is Firefox-only.

Please refer to the individual commit messages for detailed information.

@timvandermeij Can you please review this? Since we're getting close to [next Firefox release](https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar#Future_branch_dates), it would be good to get this fixed now to avoid having to uplift patches manually.

---

Even with these patches, there are still some visual glitches (from #6299) present. Below is an illustration of what things looks like before thumbnails are rendered (note the small empty rectangles). This seems to be an issue related to the fact that you cannot set the `width/height` of an empty `image` (as opposed to a `canvas`).

I know how I'd like to fix this, but since that might require some discussion regarding the implementation, I wanted to submit the current PR to address the most important breakage first.

Given that documents may contain very long outlines, I've added a utility function to avoid creating a lot of unnecessary `RegExp` objects.
To avoid any future issues, this utility function is used for both the outline and the attachments.

Fixes #6416.

6425,2015-09-07 11:05:38,"For (1, 0) cmaps, we have two different codepaths depending on whether the font has/hasn't got an encoding. But with (3, 1) cmaps we don't have a good fallback when the encoding is missing, hence this patch changes `readCmapTable` to only choose a (3, 1) cmap table if the font is non-symbolic _and_ an encoding exists. Without this, we'll not be able to successfully create a working glyph map for some TrueType fonts with (3, 1) cmap tables.

Fixes #6410.

Either this was intentional, or @shorlander simply forgot to provide a RTL version in https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/6242#issuecomment-133462395. If this was not intended, then I think that we should fix this. We basically have three options:
1. Ask Stephen Horlander for the RTL asset. (This would seem like the ""correct"" solution to me, since he should have a vector original for the asset.)
2. Flip the asset using CSS, e.g. using `transform: scaleX(-1)` or similar.
3. Creating the asset ourselves, based on the the existing one. (Since this would basically mean re-saving a PNG file, I'm not sure if that would be using such a great idea.)

Given that we're getting close to the next uplift, [see dates here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar#Future_branch_dates), we probably need to make a decision, and if necessary fix this very soon (e.g. within the upcoming week, if we want to avoid shipping the current state in Firefox).

6287,2015-07-30 19:10:02,"This is a tracking issue after the excellent triage done by @THausherr on several shading pattern issues. The PDF files below worked after #4192 (with the viewer preview at http://107.21.233.14:8877/a2a6295988a73d2/web/viewer.html), but not anymore with the current master.

Below is a list of files that definitely regressed. I have looked through the entire `4-shading-pattern` category to create this list. We need to determine the exact cause of the issue.
1. https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/2175324/261931/2532062c-8d0a-11e2-8fa6-845fdbcb735f.png (from #2948, rename .png to .pdf)
2. http://www.archimate.nl/content/bestanden/archimate_made_practical_2008-04-28.pdf (from #3462)
3. http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-MMXS5/0x0x827039/370849E8-1114-474D-963D-74CE277CA3B6/TRIP_1Q15_Investor_Presentation_v3.pdf (from #6183, although this also looked bad in #4192, but at least the right pattern was there)
4. http://ctan.cs.uu.nl/graphics/pgf/contrib/pgfplots/doc/pgfplots.pdf (from #6231, especially page 128 looked much better in http://107.21.233.14:8877/a10a71131aab410/web/viewer.html)
5. https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12647093/coons-function.pdf (from #6284,  looked almost perfect in http://107.21.233.14:8877/a10a71131aab410/web/viewer.html aside from the lines to the bottom of the page)

I have bisected this with file 1 and found the following:

Unfortunately changing a number of the `height: 32px;` instances to `height: auto;` seems to have resulted in various size/alignment issues.
For example: the `height` of the `findbar` now defaults to `33px` instead of `32px`, so that needs to be fixed. Another visual glitch that this PR introduces (again it's `height: auto;`) is that the initial height of the `loadingBar` changes, see the screen-shot below.
Do we actually, at least in this PR, need to change the `height` of anything _except_ the `findbar`, since it causes various issues (and is going to require _very_ careful manual testing to avoid breakage)?

![loadingbar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2692120/8929050/ed285222-3522-11e5-9058-7512f7aa28ac.png)

---

**Edit:** Also, it seems that there's still room for improvement regarding how the `findbar` wraps elements. At e.g. a `width` of around `480px`, the height looks a bit off since only the `findMsg` is moved.

![findbar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2692120/8929341/fbcd3b56-3524-11e5-8c7f-8a13f4c123ce.png)

**Edit2:** Perhaps we should just hide `findMsg` when it's empty, since that should probably take care of issues like these, e.g.

6273,2015-07-26 15:01:25,"Currently, `src/core/core.js` uses the `fromRef` method on an `Annotation` object to obtain the right annotation type object (such as `LinkAnnotation` or `TextAnnotation`). That method in turn uses a method `getConstructor` to find out which annotation type object must be returned.

Aside from the fact that there is currently a lot of code to achieve this, these methods should not be part of the base `Annotation` class at all. Creation of annotation object should be done by a factory (as also recommended by @yurydelendik at https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/5218#issuecomment-52779659) that handles finding out the correct annotation type object and returning it. This patch implements this separation of concerns.

Doing this allows us to also simplify the code quite a bit and to make it more readable. Additionally, we are now able to get rid of the hardcoded array of supported annotation types. The factory takes care of checking the annotation types and falls back to returning the base annotation type (and issuing a warning, which the current code also does not do well) when an annotation type is unsupported.

I have manually tested this commit with 20 test PDFs with different annotation types, such as /Link, /Text, /Widget, /FileAttachment and /FreeText. All render identically before and after the patch, and unsupported annotation types are now properly indicated with a warning in the console.

@Snuffleupagus Would you be so kind again to review this? To test this, you can use all PDFs in issues with the `4-annotation` label (both open and closed) and check rendering and the console before and after the patch. If you want even more test files, I can provide the 20 test PDFs I used to test this, but I think the `4-annotation` label contains enough PDFs to properly verify this.

6257,2015-07-23 14:10:23,"This patch cleans up `viewer.js` a bit by removing the unused globals `getVisibleElements` and `watchScroll` (both became obsolete after moving the thumbnail code to its own file) and by removing the `updateViewarea` function. It seems superfluous to have an entire function essentially only for calling `PDFViewerApplication.pdfViewer.update()`. On top of that, it is only used in two places, one of which (the `resize` event handler) already performs the check if PDFViewerApplication is initialized, making the function even less useful as it would do the exact same check again. Therefore inlining that part seemed cleaner and in the `resize` event handler we only use the `update()` line instead of repeating the check.

- Would it be possible to make the +/- slightly larger (and/or bolder), since even with the colour change they are still a bit hard to spot?
- Another idea is to ask @shorlander for +/- icons, and use that instead.
- Also, since the effective width for each `outlineItem` is now slightly reduced (given that the +/- requires some horizontal space), could we perhaps reduce the padding somewhat?

6215,2015-07-15 17:15:43,"This PR provides (minor) clean-up for the annotation border styles. There are three changes:
- `this.borderStyle.setStyle('S');` is wrong as `setStyle` takes a `Name` as parameter, not a string. Somehow we all missed this during review, but fortunately we do not even need that line because the solid border style is the default.
- The `drawBorder` parameter for `initContainer` has become unused after the annotation border style refactoring, so we can remove it.
- A unit test has been adjusted for the same reason as the first point: `setStyle` takes a `Name` as parameter, not a dictionary (even though that worked too, it is better to keep it the same as what we expect).

@Snuffleupagus Could you review this one too?

6214,2015-07-15 16:19:05,"This PR has the following goals:
- Add unit tests for annotation colors. These tests describe the exact behavior that the annotation's `setColor` method should have according to the specification at https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf#page=607&zoom=auto,-246,289.
- Implement the `setColor` method on an annotation as described by the unit tests. Note that this also adds support for grayscale and CMYK color spaces (previously a TODO) practically for free.
- Remove old color handling code and switch that to calling `setColor`.
- Adjust and simplify the annotation display code. `setColor` takes care of color space conversion and color array preparation (as RGB), so we do not need to convert anything in the display layer anymore.

This rewrite automatically fixes an issue in the old code where transparency (here with `color = null`) would not be interpreted correctly and it would draw as black instead.

@Snuffleupagus Could you review this? It is a fairly easy patch and half of it are unit tests. http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pdfcomment/doc/pdfcomment.pdf is a good document to verify that the colors are still the same before and after the patch (see page 6).

6200,2015-07-12 23:41:55,"When the user edits the URL and changes the reference fragment (hash), PDF.js intercepts this action, and saves the then-current history state in the previous history entry. This is implemented by navigating back, editing the history and navigating forward again.

The current logic has a flaw: It assumes that calling `history.back()` and `history.forward()` immediately updates the history state. This is however not guaranteed by the web standards, which states that calling e.g. `history.back` ""must traverse the history by a delta -1"", which means that the browser must QUEUE a task to traverse the session history, per spec (http://w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110113/history.html#dom-history-back and https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#dom-history-back).

Firefox and Internet Explorer deviate from the standards by immediately changing the history state instead of queuing the navigation. WebKit derived browsers (Chrome, Opera, Safari) and Opera presto do not.

The user-visible consequence of strictly adhering to the standards in PDF.js can be shown as follows:
1. Edit the URL
2. Append #page=2 for example.
3. Press Enter.  
   -> Presto and WebKit: PDF.js reverts to the previous URL.
   -> Gecko and Trident: PDF.js keeps the new URL, as expected.

To fix the issue, modification of the previous history item happens in a few asynchronous steps, guided by the popstate event to detect when the history navigation request has been committed.

(I have also put the above message in the commit message together with some additional notes about the implementation).

6192,2015-07-10 10:01:30,"_This is the next step towards fixing #6158._

This patch removes the dependency on the state of the scale `<select>` dropdown from the `resize` event handler, and instead uses the (in `PDFViewer`) stored `currentScaleValue`.
I believe that the way this code is currently written is purely for historical reasons, since originally _only_ the numerical scale was stored internally (hence there was no other way to access the scale value).
However, since we now store the scale value, we should use it instead of quering the DOM. This helps ensure that the internally stored scale value is always accurately displayed in the UI (which should be good since, after the creation of `PDFViewer`, the `<select>` DOM element is now updated by an event handler).

Interestingly enough, when comparing the border colours to the rendering in Adobe Reader, it appears that the borders are rendered with the colours that the actual annotations _should_ have.

I'm tentatively marking this as a regression from #5585, since there shouldn't be any borders visible.

6035,2015-07-15 19:44:04,"Probably all code you need is in https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/pdf_thumbnail_view.js. At https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/pdf_thumbnail_view.js#L242-L261 we render the page onto a thumbnail canvas.

The idea is that when thumbnails are created, they are drawn on a separate canvas. We have to keep these canvases in memory such that the thumbnail viewer can be used at all times. The goal of this issue is to package the rendered thumbnails as PNG instead of keeping them as canvases in order to reduce the memory we need for them (canvas is essentially a plain pixel map and PNG is more compressed). Maybe we can just use `canvas.toDataURL('image/png');`, otherwise we have a ""convert image data to PNG"" component at https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/d10573468634e5b1f431821ec2f8cf80d5a64ef6/src/display/svg.js#L29-L219. If we must use that here, we should extract it into a separate component and apply that to the thumbnails.

For more details I hereby ping @yurydelendik, but he is currently on vacation, so it might take some time before he responds here.

For starters it would be nice to have a benchmark of how much memory the thumbnails use in the current implementation. Take the PDF reference for example with 1310 pages: https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf. Theoretically, here (http://logs.glob.uno/?c=mozilla%23pdfjs&s=19+May+2015&e=19+May+2015&h=package#c34123) is the size of one thumbnail, so multiplying that by 1310 _should_ give an upper bound for the memory usage of the thumbnails, but we do not know if that theoretical bound is also true in practice. Once we have an idea of the current memory usage, you can create this PNG patch and see if it indeed helps to reduce memory usage.

6021,2015-05-15 14:19:36,"Some time ago I attempted to make the test suite work with the SVG back-end. I then found that the current testing code is really unmaintainable at some points and figured that it had to be corrected before we have a chance of adding new functionality (such as a back-end or WebGL switch).

This patch refactors the test driver by making it more class-like and removing quite some complexity from hacks and unneeded functions. Not only does this make the code much more readable, it also allows us to extend the code in a cleaner way because we got rid of the `window.load` dependency, `innerHTML` usages and many callbacks. Not all callbacks have been removed because the remaining ones are not too invasive and this patch can be seen as a major first step in cleaning up the test driver.

@Snuffleupagus Would you be up for reviewing this? It is not as daunting as it might look at first sight because a lot of it is just moving code around. The other changes are largely the same as the other refactoring PRs we have done. Reviewing with `?w=1` helps a bit, especially for the third commit.

6020,2015-05-15 11:51:38,"Having recently spent some time staring at the PasswordPrompt, while fixing issue #6010, I felt that the current border style does not really give a good visual  indication that the input field actually has focus.

The current appearance was first introduced in PR #3527; but I don't know if having a different border style in Overlay dialogs was intentional, or if it just ""happened"".
However, given the colour palette used in the viewer UI, I think that using the same border style for all .toolbarFields makes sense.

The idea of this patch is to explore working with two backends (canvas and SVG) and to run the tests for the SVG backend. It is based on @yurydelendik's work in #5159. Please feel free to provide suggestions such that we can come up with a solution that can actually be implemented. The goal of this PR is to explore where the difficulties are and to try to overcome them. A follow-up patch can then provide a pretty solution.

Current problems:
- [ ] SVG to PNG does not keep font data. A possible solution is to render the SVG on a canvas and save that.
- [ ] We can do with less code edits (e.g., text test removal), but for now this was the fastest. The test driver needs to be refactored to make certain code paths depend on `PDFJS.displayBackend` to solve this. There are no text tests for the SVG backend as there is no text layer, but SVG text instead.

1. Open https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7246095/example_RTL.pdf
2. Repeat step 2-3 of test 1 (expect 5 pages).

5699,2015-02-04 16:30:32,"This PR follows a similar pattern to PR #5673. The main goal of this refactoring has been to break the existing dependencies between Presentation Mode code, and other parts of the code base.

Since I know, from own past experiences with PDF.js, that when working with the fullscreen API it's sometimes very easy to introduce subtle bugs that only show up for certain browsers/OSes/platforms, I've tried to avoid making any significant functional changes in these patches.
To make both development and reviewing simpler, I've split the PR into a (perhaps too large) number of patches to make it easier to ascertain that nothing breaks.

As it currently stands, the Presentation Mode code still depends on `PDFViewerApplication`. I looked into replacing that with e.g. an instance of [`IPDFLinkService`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/interfaces.js#L19-L54)/[`SimpleLinkService`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/pdf_viewer.js#L718-L763), but in their current state they don't implement all the necessary methods.
With these patches, `PDFPresentationMode` depends on the `PDFViewerApplication.{page, currentScaleValue, setScale, pagesCount}` methods, and currently only `page` is present in the interface.
@yurydelendik Could/should we extend the interfaces with the necessary methods, i.e. `{getScale, setScale, pagesCount}`, or is another solution preferred? (In a way the interfaces actually already support setting the scale, through the `setHash` method.)

PS. For some of the larger patches, using the `?w=1` URL flag should help considerably when reviewing the code.

1. I'd like feedback on the general structure, and the file/class dependencies, that these patches introduces from @yurydelendik before we land this.
2. Also, I'd appreciate if this didn't land _just_ before we sync PDF.js with `mozilla-central`, which is usually done during the week before a Firefox branch point (see [Future branch dates](https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar#Future_branch_dates)).

5651,2015-01-15 13:15:49,"_This PR is based on a patch written by @brendandahl._

The first patch fixed most of the issues, and needed only a very minor adjustment to work correctly for fonts with a `CIDToGIDMap`.
However in some browsers (e.g. the release version of Firefox), the first patch caused a lot of `notdef` glyphs to appear in a number of the test files.
After quite a bit of debugging, I found that this was usually an issue with the way that the `space` character was mapped. In the problematic PDF files, `space` was usually mapped to various (low) control charCodes.

Since the `space` glyph (obviously) doesn't need any glyph data, and is thus empty, this causes it to be added to `missingGlyphs` by [`sanitizeGlyphLocations()`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/fonts.js#L3489).
To work around this, I'm proposing that we also look at `toUnicode` when building the `charCodeToGlyphId` map. If the charCode exists in `toUnicode` the glyph is most likely needed, even if it's empty, hence we add it to the `charCodeToGlyphId` map. This lets [`adjustMapping()`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/fonts.js#L2662), if necessary, move the charCode to the Private Use Area and thus fixing the issues with `notdef` being displayed.

I hope that this approach is reasonable (it passes all tests locally)!

5545,2014-12-16 17:32:05,"## The Problem

Text selection in pdf.js does not work so well. If while dragging, your cursor is not directly on top of a text element, then you get unexpected results. This occurs with nearly all examples, including [the tracemonkey example](http://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html).  Try starting a selection, then dragging the mouse to a blank whitespace area beneath the initial selection. You'll see the selection gets reversed. If you keep moving your mouse, it flickers and is generally a horrible experience. I'm not the first to report this, it is the subject of at least #4629 and #4843. 
## The Solution

The reason why selection doesn't work is because most browsers rely on padding between text to detect text flow.  The solution, therefore, is to increase padding of each text element so that each element runs right up next to the next element. 
### Other Solutions

Adding padding to each text element was recognized as a possible solution by @mitar in #4843.  However, in #4843, the suggested solution was relatively complex, which included modifying the padding dynamically whenever a mouse moves. It was also written in CoffeeScript for a completely separate viewer and porting it seemed difficult.
### This Solution

In this solution, the padding is calculated when the text elements are added. For each added text element, we find the nearest neighbor to the right that is on the same line. We then set the `padding-right` of the text element to that distance.  Similarly, for `padding-bottom` we find the next line that is underneath the text element, and set the padding to the difference between lines.  Setting `padding-bottom` is especially helpful for PDFs that are double spaced (lots of space between lines).

The solution isn't all milk and honey though. The computation is `O(N^2)`, which could be bad for complex PDFs.  There are [fancier algorithms to find the nearest neighbor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search), but for now, for each text element, we look at every other text element to see if it's nearest.

_UPDATE_: As discussed below, the `O(N^2)` issue in this pull request has been resolved by using a quadtree datastructure.

5509,2014-11-30 16:48:23,"A quick look at the file suggests that there are multiple issues present, but the most visible one is that after commit https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/commit/f48f57e30a06171ed1ba56fd73fed3e0a864c852 (i.e. PR #4323) no part of the first page renders.
In newer versions of PDF.js the debug output is unfortunately gone from the console, but previously the following was printed: 



I've tried to figure out what breaks in commit https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/commit/f48f57e30a06171ed1ba56fd73fed3e0a864c852, and found that the problem is at line https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/commit/f48f57e30a06171ed1ba56fd73fed3e0a864c852#diff-0b94c2e77a5259f7a728122fdbf9f46aL1243.
With the previous (lower) value for `CHUNK_SIZE`, we managed to parse part of the first page before encountering the error. It thus appear that we, at least partially, used to paper over the underlying issue which seem to be that two Axial Shading dictionaries are missing their `Function` entries.

I'm not sure if I'd really consider this issue a regression, since the error existed prior to PR #4323, but given that we now fail to render any part of the first page it does seem slightly worse.

It would appear that we need to figure out a way to ignore invalid Axial Shadings, but I'm not sure how we should do that.
@yurydelendik Any ideas?

It turns out that this PDF uses large sequences of ""(save, transform, paintImageMaskXObject, restore)"" to draw the road pattern.
When I looked into where reuse of calculations could be performed, I noticed that the optimizer does build groups:



however in almost all cases of this document these groups contain a large number of identical images.
For example when breaking in that optimize method, only the first image of that group seems to be different.
@nnethercote already noticed something similar on this document.

I am opening this issue to allow others who have more experience with evaluator.js to comment on the issue.
It seems to me that it should be possible to optimize subsequences for the same image a lot better.

I've managed to track down the issue to line https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/web/page_view.js#L371. It appears that for this particular case, we actually _need_ to set `noScroll = true` when calling the `_setScale` function.

5234,2014-08-23 19:51:35,"This PR contains a tentative patch to fix #3485 (and should also fix #5228, #4774).

I was slightly unsure of the best way to handle the rejection of `workerReadyCapability`, since it's not easily available outside of `getDocument` and I didn't just want to expose it in `PDFJS`.
A caveat with this patch is that it's only possible to abort the current `getDocument`, so if you have multiple ones active simultaneously this isn't going to work. Since this implementation should work fine when used in the generic viewer (e.g. for #5228), I don't know if it's really worth complicating the solution too much.

One other thing to note here: `abortGetDocument` really only makes sense when `getDocument` isn't resolved/rejected yet, since otherwise just calling `destroy` is enough.

~~When I started looking at this, I realized that our current exception handling code wasn't really working as intended (rejection with multiple arguments). The first commit fixes this, and I'd be happy to extract that into a separate PR if that's preferred.~~ Submitted as a separate PR.

In the meantime, I'm submitting this patch to workaround the bug. Prior to #4259, we used to default to a (3, 1) cmap table when no standard one was found, which is why I hope this patch will be OK as a temporary fix.

This patch:
- Re-factors `setFileSize()` to _only_ update `rawFileSize`, and moves parsing and fetching of the l10n string to a separate method that isn't called until the Document Properties dialog is actually opened.
- Adds a couple of checks to make sure that `rawFileSize` is set to a positive number.
- Removes the `fileName` and `fileSize` properties. Since they are parsed every time the Document Properties dialog is opened, it doesn't seem necessary to cache them.

What's somewhat troubling here is that we currently have CMap unit tests that passes, _despite_ not working as intended (the CMap files doesn't load).

**Edit:** When failing to `GET` a CMap we should `error`, see [cmap.js#L390-L392](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/cmap.js#L390-L392) and [cmap.js#L930-L932](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/cmap.js#L930-L932), but the condition isn't true, even when the CMap fails to load.
I found a [review comment for PR #4259](https://github.com/brendandahl/pdf.js/commit/b5b94a4af389ef387570cf22662d9fc6bd41417a#commitcomment-5434455) that was never addressed, which (in my testing) would fix the current situation where we fail to throw an error when the CMap is unavailable.

In this PR I'm also removing the remaining references to cidmaps.js, which I missed in #5088.

4823,2014-05-21 15:28:35,"The current way that the overlays (`PasswordPrompt` and `DocumentProperties`) are handled are less than ideal for a number of reasons. Among those are:
- Currently the code that is used to open/close an overlay needs to be duplicated for every one. If we want to add more overlays (e.g. #3985), this will only get worse over time.
- The way that the current overlays are implemented also means that adding another overlay would require code changes to all the existing ones.
- There is no way to prevent multiple overlays being opened at the same time, which might lead to ""interesting"" results.

To avoid the issues described above, and to also unify and simplify how overlays work, this PR introduces the `OverlayManager`.

Fixes #3522.

I've struggled with the best way to create the `isEmpty` property for the `DecodeStream`. The first idea, to check if `peekBytes(1)` returns data won't work at the end of the stream. Furthermore just checking if `this.buffer` is null or empty won't work either, because if `ensureBuffer` has been called that no longer holds even if the stream was actually empty. The only remaining (simple) approach seem to be to read enough of the stream and then check if `this.bufferLength === 0`, since that should only happen when the stream is actually empty.

If the current approach used in this PR isn't any good, we might instead do something along these lines:

4800,2014-05-24 10:07:07,"The issue here is that for some of the fonts in the PDF file, the cmap table is (0, 1) which doesn't seem to be in accordance with the specification.<sup>1</sup> Since we regard that as a non-valid cmap table, [`readCmapTable`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/fonts.js#L2926) will just return `[]` (see [fonts.js#L2974](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/fonts.js#L2974)). This return value causes issues at [fonts.js#L3877](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/fonts.js#L3877), since `cmapMappings` is thus undefined which causes the error. To reduce the severity of this issue, we could easily at least workaround the error (I'll submit a tentative patch).

The reason that this ""worked"" prior to PR #4259, is that we used to fall back to the (3, 1) cmap table when no valid one was found. I'm assuming that @brendandahl changed this for a reason, so a proper solution would probably require some kind of heuristic to guess which table to use.

__
[1] The PDF specification is ""helpful"" enough to explain that issues exist, but isn't particularly forthcoming with the details, as can be seen it the following quote:

> Some popular TrueType font programs contain incorrect encoding information. Implementations of TrueType font interpreters have evolved heuristics for dealing with such problems; **those heuristics are not described here**. For maximum portability, only well-formed TrueType font programs should be used in PDF files. Therefore, a TrueType font program in a PDF file may need to be modified to conform to these guidelines.

In the PDF file in the issue a lot of the fonts have bogus `ToUnicode` dictionaries where all chars point to `0xFFFD`, i.e. inside the specials Unicode block `[0xFFF0, 0xFFFF]`. (This should also explain why even Adobe Reader is unable to copy most of the text in the document) 

Given that we currently ignore the specials Unicode block in other places (e.g. in `mapSpecialUnicodeValues`, [fonts.js#L503-L505](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/fonts.js#L503-L505)), it seemed reasonable to do the same thing here.

Another way is to get rid of eval. It seems that the code string follows a strict format;



Instead of generating a string of code, we could create a list of commands.
This could be implemented as a array of commands, names and arguments (at generation in the worker) and a loop (in the viewer).

Personally I would prefer if you modified (or added to) the current `textLayer` debugging, instead of basically duplicating existing code. @yurydelendik What do you think?

",Snuffleupagus,yurydelendik
4629,2014-06-18 14:44:48,"My idea was to start with this from scratch. I see three main areas to be improved:
- performance
- matching of the text layer and the canvas text
- UX, e.g. less flickering on selecting bigger text blocks

The performance issues are mainly caused by to expensive text layers in terms of DOM. Basically for some types of PDFs each single character ends up in its own composite layer (in its own scaled absolute positioned element). This makes e.g. scrolling of these documents very slow.

There are IMO two main issues to improve matching of the text, ensure that really the correct font family gets selected (the PDFs are often lying about the font family, i did some tests with xor'ing the target font with all main font families, that turnes out to work pretty well). The other issue is word spacing. Currently the word spacing is not exposed to the text layer (there is some code which tries to address that with inserting spaces between text fragments if the white space is bigger than an according white space, but that covers only limited set of PDFs, e.g. not the ones which define word spacing instead). Exposing it makes adjustments in the text layer a bit more complicated, but it should IMO be possible. @Hengjie code mainly tries to improve the text matching.

UX issue, like flickering while selecting whole text blocks, are caused by the current DOM structure, e.g. an elemnt of the text layer contains at most only a single line.

This PR here addresses all issues to some extend. Most of the changes are in the text layer. But i think it would make more sense to move most of that code down to buildTextGeometry, basically move that call to it's own class and add to the according geometry objects also line numbers and ideally text block numbers. There are four PS instructions which call buildTextGeometry to create text geometry objects,  OPS.showSpacedText, OPS.showText, OPS.nextLineShowText, OPS.nextLineSetSpacingShowText. Right now only OPS.showSpacedText accumulates text fragments in a geometry object, but at least OPS.showText should do that too (this is the main reason for the performance issues).

But the main issue is that i don't really have time anymore to work on this. I can probably update this PR here to the newest mainline, but i have no time to do the changes which i have had in mind. Perhaps discuss with @yurydelendik if that makes sense or if you would like to restart from scratch with these improvements?

4293,2014-04-21 11:14:48,"I've tried looking into this and I'm wondering if we somehow end up choosing the wrong way to process one of the font files, which leads to this issue. The problematic font is `F5 (dict) [id: 5, gen: 0]`:

![font_f5](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2692120/2753818/99dff22c-c940-11e3-8ca0-6019017eec0d.png)

At [fonts.js#L2279-L2280](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/fonts.js#L2279-L2280) we choose to process this font file as a Type1 font. This becomes problematic immediately at [fonts.js#L5284-L5285](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/fonts.js#L5284-L5285), since neither the `Length1` or `Length2` properties are defined in the font.

If we instead process the file as a CFF font ([fonts.js#L2279-L2280](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/fonts.js#L2279-L2280)), the PDF document seems to load just fine. To me, this indicates one of two possibilities:
- The font file is a Type1 font program, but the necessary ""length"" properties are missing. (In my limited experience, Type1 font programs usually look differently so I'm less inclined to believe this explanation.)
- The font file is a CFF font program, but we fail to classify it as such.

If the first explanation is correct, we would need a way to infer reasonable values for the `Length1` and `Length2` properties. In the other case, we need to modify the way we detect how to parse the font program.
(For testing purposes, I just added `|| !properties.length1` to line [fonts#L2279](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/core/fonts.js#L2279), but I cannot imagine that being any good in production code.)

Unfortunately I don't know enough about fonts to get any further in the analysis. 
@yurydelendik Any ideas?

4126,2014-01-15 23:19:02,"Opera 19 has finally added support for the streamsPrivate API, and whitelisted the [PDF Viewer hosted on addons.opera.com](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/pdf-viewer/) with (extension ID encfpfilknmenlmjemepncnlbbjlabkc).

This feature was developed 5 months ago at https://github.com/Rob--W/pdf.js/issues/1. The main new features are support for POST requests and FTP urls.

See commit messages for implementation notes.
To test the extension in Opera 19, follow the following steps:
1. Get Opera 19 from http://www.opera.com/computer/next (I've tested with v19.0.1326.26).
2. Build the extension (instructions at https://github.com/Rob--W/pdf.js/issues/1), or get a test build from https://robwu.nl/pdfjs/pdfjs-0.8.877-streamsPrivate.zip
3. Unpack the zip file.
4. Start Opera, and go to Extensions (Ctrl + E).
5. Click on the button to enable Developer mode.
6. Click on ""Load unpacked extension"".
7. Use the file browser to select the directory containing the contents of the extracted zip file (or if you've built yourself: `pdf.js/build/chromium`).
8. To verify that the new feature works as intended, try to view a PDF file from a FTP site. Just Google for ""ftp pdf"" and pick any search result that serves a PDF file over `ftp:`.

Unfortunately, Chromium has not yet responded to the request of getting the extension ID whitelisted: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=326949 The extension will gracefully fall back to the current behavior in Chrome/Chromium.

3850,2013-10-27 12:47:24,"This PR implements a framework for default preferences in PDF.js, hence this supersedes #3255.
Compared to the previous patch, this one is written such that is should be completely browser/platform agnostic.

In this PR the functions for reading/writing the preferences are provided as empty stubs, which are then overridden by specific versions for the different builds.
@brendandahl Is that the approach you had in mind with [this comment](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/3255#issuecomment-26373931), or should it be done differently?

In this initial patch, the following default preferences are added (default values in bold):
- `showPreviousViewOnLoad`: **true** | false. <br />
  Setting this to false will always load the document at the first page.
- `defaultZoomValue`: **[empty string]**. <br />
  Setting this to either one of the predefined zoom values (auto, page-actual, page-fit or page-width), or a numerical value, will load all documents with this zoom value _irrespective_ of the saved zoom settings.
- `ifAvailableShowOutlineOnLoad`: **false** | true. <br />
  Setting this to true will automatically display the outline when the document is loaded, but _only if_ the document actually contains an outline.

As a follow-up to this PR, I've got a prototype UI for displaying/changing the preferences in the viewer.

Fixes #1624, #2568 and [bug 845946](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=845946); and contains an improved version of PR #2691.

PS. @brendandahl I really like your suggestion about the current `Settings`: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/3255#issuecomment-26374851, but I decided to implement that in a follow-up PR to keep this patch smaller and easier to test.

If you open a bot-generated B2G viewer, the zoom buttons below behave rather strangely. I'm not sure if that issue also occurs in the B2G viewer app.

If you load the viewer and click the + button, nothing happens. Clicking the - button doesn't zoom the document out by one step, but immediately to the smallest zoom level (25%). After that, the + button behaves as expected.

Also, zooming in makes the document blurry, i.e. not re-rendered.

What is the problem with using text/html & UTF-8? It wasn't immediately obvious to me. I tried a few different PDFs, a 404 PDF, and a very slow connection speed, but I couldn't detect any difference.

To try using HTML, change [line 176 of extensions/chromium/pdfHandler.js](../blob/master/extensions/chromium/pdfHandler.js#l176)\* from:



to:



If you want to do this in an installed extension, here is how I did it:
1. Open the `pdfHandler.js` file (in OS X, it is somewhere in this vicinity: ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/0.8.558_0/pdfHandler.js)
2. Change line 176 as above
3. If you disable then enable the PDF Viewer extension, `pdfHandler.js` will be reloaded**

Disclaimer: I'm new to this project, so I haven't yet taken the time to set things up locally & run tests and whatnot. Happy to do more legwork if necessary.
- [Permalink](../blob/f2ad0f73d712ad52950f9dab6a6862d1dc0d4f03/extensions/chromium/pdfHandler.js#l176) to the current revision for future reference.

*\* Because it is loaded from a ""background page"" the extension needs to be restarted -- see http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/background_pages.html

3781,2013-10-08 10:00:19,"Currently in the viewer, clicking the viewBookmark ""buttons"" (they are actually links, styled to look like the other buttons) updates the hash corresponding to the current document position.
By either middle-clicking or right-clicking (and choosing open in new tab/window) the user is able to open the current document position in a new tab/window. This behaviour is probably not very discoverable, but this is most likely a non-issue when the viewer is used ""standalone"". However, when the viewer is _embedded_ in a page, the viewBookmark ""buttons"" will appear to do nothing when clicked.

This PR changes the behaviour of the viewBookmark ""buttons"" slightly when the viewer is _embedded_. With this patch, the ""buttons"" will instead, by default, open the current document position in a new window. To let the user know that this feature exists when the viewer is _embedded_, the strings are also changed slightly to reflect this behaviour.

This PR (together with #3739) should thus fix [bug 921162](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=921162).

2. When the file starts to load and the first page is rendered, click _immediately_ on the link on the first page.
(This is the difficult step, since the click needs to happen before the destination specified in the hash is resolved.)
3. Open the Sidebar, switch to the Outline View and scroll down and click on the item: ""New Commands, Environments and Packages"".

**Expected result:**
The history should contain three states: `section.6.1`, `page.157` and `section.6.1`.

**Actual result:**
The history contains two states: `section.6.1`, `page.157`.

3634,2013-08-31 22:19:20,"When the server does not provide a Content-Length with the initial PDF request, e.g. when chunked transfer-encoding is used - which is common for dynamically generated  files, then the Download action of pdf.js will not save the data as retrieved, but instead the data will be padded by 0-bytes up to a certain bound.

What happens is the following:
- PdfDataListener will get an initial buffer of 0x10000 (64kb) length when the size is unknown. https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/8a4a6f498f06a86e27336d71dc08f06ecb78d3cd/extensions/firefox/components/PdfStreamConverter.js#L139
- When that buffer would overflow during the data transfer, it is doubled again and again until the data would fit. (BTW: This seems a bit wasteful once you get into the multi-MB area...) https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/8a4a6f498f06a86e27336d71dc08f06ecb78d3cd/extensions/firefox/components/PdfStreamConverter.js#L149-L157
- However, when the data transfer completes, neither is the buffer shrunk to the actual size again, nor is the actual size noted -> On download the full, over-sized buffer will be saved. Only a new `.subarray()` view is taken: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/8a4a6f498f06a86e27336d71dc08f06ecb78d3cd/extensions/firefox/components/PdfStreamConverter.js#L165
- The blobURI created for the download will use the underlying buffer, which is still over-sized: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/427dd3948be41f68daf2e3e3ad9bbeab94b920e3/web/viewer.js#L630

STR:
- Open http://alpha.papeeria.com/d/pdf/f6cbdf88778f3bfc2217fc3745373cc5.pdf which uses chunked transfer-encoding (provided by @gkalabin via http://stackoverflow.com/q/18538195/484441)
- Hit the pdf.js download button and save the pdf.

Expected:
File size should be 5420 byte.

Actual:
File size is 65536 byte (0x10000, initial buffer size) and the file is padded by 0-bytes after the initial transfer.

3449,2013-07-08 15:58:56,"This PR makes couple of small optimizations of the browsing history implementation in PDF.js:
- Remove the `beforeunload` event listener during unload, i.e. when navigation away from the document.
  This partially addresses the current issue, where the PDF file is fetched again when navigating back in the history. With this patch I get the following behaviour when navigating back to the document:
  - Using the web viewer, the document is loaded instantaneously.
  - In the Firefox extension, I get two different behaviours:
    - If range requests are **disabled**, the document is loaded _almost_ instantaneously. The loading bar is visible very briefly (maybe for a second), and then the document is immediately rendered. In this case, it seems that when the document is requested, it's fetched from the network cache as it should.
    - If range requests are **enabled**, the entire document is fetched again, forcing you to wait for it to load. To me this indicates that the issue might be that Firefox isn't caching range requests as it should.
      In this situation, this patch does not improve the current situation. Unfortunately I do not believe that is much more that I can do as far as the browsing history implementation goes.
- A small change that prevents the same destination from being added to the history twice, when navigating back to the document from another page in the browser history. (Note that this will only happen under certain circumstances.)
- Finally, I also added a few more comments in the code.

This uses `about:config` to store the preferences, hence this will only work in the Firefox add-on and should also work in the version of pdf.js that is included in Firefox.

This PR implements a framework for reading/writing of default preferences, so it should be easy to add more preferences if needed. (Since most preferences that I can think of only matters when a document is loaded, I haven't bothered adding any preference observers.)
Currently this PR adds the following three preferences (default values in bold):

`PREF_PREFIX.showPreviousViewOnLoad` = **true** | false.
Setting this preference to false will always load the document at the first page.
Related issue: #2568.

`PREF_PREFIX.defaultZoomValue` = **{empty string}**
Setting this preference to either a numerical value, or one of the predefined zoom values, will load all documents at the user defined zoom level. To avoid issues if the user sets this to an non-existent value, part of PR #2970 is needed. 
Related issue: #1624.

`PREF_PREFIX.ifAvailableShowOutlineOnLoad`  = **false** | true

Now it has to be integrated, such that the user is able to quickly toggle between hand and text selection mode, and without adding unnecessary clutter/complexity to the interface (@yurydelendik pointed out that users with a multi-touch touchpad don't even need this feature).

How should it be integrated?
- Toggle via context menu (this is only available for Firefox addons...)
- Toggle via a button on the toolbar
- Automatic detection, like SumatraPDF: automatically in hand mode when a non-text section is selected, selection mode when text is selected (how about hand tool for text-only?)
- Keyboard shortcut (how is the user supposed to remember this shortcut??)
- Modifier key (again: how is the user supposed to discover this specific combination, and how can the user switch to the hand mode without having to keep the key pressed the whole time?)
- ...?

- [x] In two-up view the margin to the left of the pages is always bigger than the right one, i.e. the pages gets placed of-centre horizontally in the viewerContainer. Edit: From looking at the HTML/CSS with the inspector in Firebug, it's clear that the margins are set totally wrong. Perhaps it would be good to instead define a special CSS class that gets invoked when switching to two-up. (This might also fix full screen mode.)
- [x] There seems to be some issue regarding the rendering of pages when toggling ""Show Cover Page in Two Page View"". Until you actually scroll, or change page, the pages won't render.
  The above also sometimes happen when switching to/from two-up, but less frequently.
- [x] It seems that the right hand page in two-up mode doesn't render as it should when scrolling. Observing how PDFView.getVisiblePages().views changes while scrolling down in a document probably explains a lot. Currently PDFView.getVisiblePages().views doesn't always correspond to what you actually see on the screen.
- [x] When zooming in, the horizontal scrollbar don't get big enough, so some of the pages gets clipped of particular on the left side. This might be related to the margins, see above.

If you try adding `#textLayer=visible` to the url, you can see that pdf.js is correctly finding and rendering the text, but is just not handling the rest of the rendering correctly.  FWIW, I've tested this (so far) only in Fx18 on Win7, and not in any of the other forms of pdf.js...

(This particular PDF came about due to my working on [this approach](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/47267/breaking-links-and-escaping-characters-in-bibliographies-with-backlinks-and-ocgc/47309#47309) to rendering links in LaTeX using highlighting instead of boxes.  The text is rendered into the current clipping path (`7 Tr`) rather than as normal text (`0 Tr`), then the clipping path is filled with the normal text color and, within an optional content group, filled again using the highlight color.  IIRC, [`canvas.js#L982`](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/src/canvas.js#L982) already has some support for adding text to the clipping path, but it doesn't seem to be working here...

I modified font.js as you did in your pull request and some of the characters were still broken or missing. So I set it to 0 instead of 5. It improved a bit more but it's not complete.

Indeed, I still have found 2 broken or missing characters ( from what I see) :
the É is not rendered at all or by something like ""..."" ( Very strange by the way),
the « is still replaced by ' .

I looked up in the blame of font.js as you said. I particularly looked at the 00f6f0e from notmasteryet about encoding initialization but I've some difficulties with it.
Is the order in the encoding important? I've seen that 'Eacute' is present, so why is it not encoded rightly?

thanks for your time. Indeed, it is better now.

However, I don't think it shoulb be closed.

@brendandahl , @yurydelendik , I still have the problem with the French quotation mark. But it's not all.

here is what I have.

On documents 2091, 2086 and 2094 posted by elblaf, I still have the French quotation mark issue.
Moreover, on document 2091, I also see é as È.

I also noticed not rendered accented characters on these two following documents:

http://www.filefactory.com/file/5fx6z4h2onur/n/holdupplanetaire_pdf

http://www.filefactory.com/file/7ddlarc93vpz/n/cl_1015_guide_porteur_trueye_v2_pdf

Finally, I have a client's document (sorry, i didn't managed to reproduce it for you yet and I can't give you the original) which also has a problem with the French quotation mark but also a problem with a <i>É</i> that is rendered ""..."" . This one is particularly strange for me. The accented character is replaced by another one, just like in document 2091.

BTW, @yuridelendik, om 2012-02-10, @notmasteryet made a change (number 00f6f0e0) in font.js, on lines 50 and more. It is something about various encoding initializations.

In fact, it is a list of arrays. What I would like to know is if it wouldn't require to ""just"" refactor those arrays to definitely solve the problem. Especially, the MacRomanEncoding and the WinAnsiEncoding ones.

- Since no password has been supplied, it throws a `PasswordException`, which is catched by the Worker
- The Worker requests a password from client (API -> Viewer)
- The viewer _prompt_s (yes I know it's ugly), the user for a password
- The getDocument method is now supplied with a password, which is hopefully the correct one.

Our Makefile is doing more than bundling a JavaScript file. It is the entry point for everything ranging from firing up the server and tests to extension building. Extension building by itself is a highly customized procedure that I don't think any mini-JS framework was designed for. `sed()` would still be useful for our `.rdf` files.

As for style/syntax (my favorite online discussion topic, not)... I must confess I wasn't going for elegance; I was going for practical. Instead of having to learn yet-another-JS-framework-for-the-problem-at-hand, folks who already have a Makefile and/or are already somewhat familiar with the Makefile/Unix syntax can immediately pick up Maker.js.

Style is a very subjective thing indeed. Even in this narrow domain of Makefile/Unix syntax there is room for discussion. For example, as pointed out by @notmasteryet: Do we strictly reproduce the Unix syntax `cp('-R file1 file2 dir/')` for the sake of brevity and familiarity, or do we JavaScriptify it to make it look, well, JavaScripty `cp(['file1', 'file2'], 'dir', {recursive:true})`? There's something to be said about both, so I might end up supporting both.

- All tools enabled by default, perhaps `pdfbug=all` as suggested by @notmasteryet 
- `Stepper` instead of `Debugger` ?
- `debugger.js` should probably live in `web/` since it's viewer-specific.

one that includes pdf.js). That's the purpose of wrapper.js

(Hope that's helpful somehow :))

At first I was trying use<browser type=""content"">  but with a chrome:// src url, which in turn gives the browser chrome privileges anyways.  After much searching, I found https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Displaying_web_content_in_an_extension_without_security_issues which suggests setting browser.src with a data url.  If we go this route we then have to bundle all html/javascript/images into one file and turn that into a data url.  I was hoping there would be something similar to chrome:// but with just regular privileges but I have yet to find anything like that.  I'm also not sure how that approach would work with loading our worker.

Uses a simple recursive descent parser to build the ""assembly code"" that is then evaluated to convert color values.  I tried to write unit tests for most of the parser and evaluator, but I skipped a number of operators that I deemed straightforward.

I also added the unit test files to the linter and fixed obj_spec.js.

It implements a Settings object in viewer.js, which then can be called globally. Right now I haven't implemented any thing but a ""remember scroll position"" feature, using window.pageYOffset, _not_ Hash objects.

Furthermore I've chosen to expose some data, thereby extending the API a little
`PDFDocModel` now has two additional members: `fileID` which is the ID attribute hidden in the XRef trailer, and `getFingerprint()` which returns the fileID if existent or a MD5 sum of the first 100 bytes in the PDF stream (after suggestion by notmasteryet).
`PDFDoc` has gotten a `fingerprint` attribute, which returns the underlying `PDFDocModel`'s `getFingerprint()` value.
`XRef` has gotten a new member `trailer` which I use to get the ID. I could imagine that this attribute could get useful for something else, later.

And finally I've implemented the `Settings` object. It works by first checking if `localStorage` is available. If it isn't it uses FUEL if it's in the extension and Cookies if not.

~~This PR doesn't really do anything but the ""remember scroll position"" stuff. But @jviereck told me to make this PR so that we could discuss where to go from here.
He suggested I use the Hash object too, but I'm a little confused on how to choose between the scroll position or the hash position.~~

- Adding the missing `selectScaleOption` function.
- Fix treatment for the 'zoom' parameter. The problem here was, that the setting backend as well as the hash-creating code uses the `PDFView.currentScale` property, which is the parsed scale as a number (1.0 = 100% zoom). However, to recover the actual last state, it is required to store the `value` passed to `parseScale`. E.g, the zoom level to recover from the setting might not be ""100%"" but ""page-width"". Therefore, it was required to store the `value` passed to `parseScale`, which is done on the `PDFView.currentScaleValue`.
  Next, the value used to store on the hash and setting was multiplied by `100`, to get the `%` value. This worked as long as the selected zoom level wasn't something with a string (e.g. `pageWidth`). I fixed stuff to work with strings now as well. This required some ""normalization"" to multiply the internal zoom level by 100 if, and only if, it's a number and not a string.

930,2011-12-13 16:01:42,"Now that we have an addon with traditional versioning (0.1.0, 0.1.1, etc), we need to think about how that affects our Github flow and branches.

The two ""simplest"" options I can think of are:
## 1. Single production branch, many forks (our current)

This is basically our current flow, which coincides with [Github's own flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html). 

In this simple case development happens in forks/branches outside the master branch, and new code is only merged after review and passing our regression tests. So the branch is always ""stable"". 

Versioning can be introduced by basically decorating the branch with git tags as we publish code out to AMO:


## 2. One production branch, one development branch, one hot fixes branch

This is a simplified version of [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

In this case experimental code is pushed to a development branch, and occasionally it is merged into the production branch after thorough review, passing all tests, etc.

From time to time, one also pushes code to a ""hot-fixes"" branch off of a common ancestor between dev and production, which fixes problems with the production branch. Then one merges in hot-fixes into both production and development.

A new version is triggered every time there is a merge into the production branch.
## Discussion

I think Github's fork system, combined with our testing infrastructure which is already tightly integrated with pull requests, naturally makes option #1 both doable and the most convenient.

In principle we would have problems applying hot-fixes to our addon since we would necessarily carry all the previous merges from the master branch. This is typically not desirable in most projects, as such merges might have introduced major features like a new UI, or worse unstable code.

In our particular case this is not a problem: the vast majority of our merges are actually ""hot-fixes"" (since they essentially fix previously broken PDFs), and in the rare cases of new ""features"" like a new UI we can simply hold that pull request back until we're ready for a new major release.

829,2011-11-22 20:13:18,"# Implement ctx.mozCurrentTransform and ctx.mozCurrentTransformInverse shim

This adds a shim for browsers that don't support `ctx.mozCurrentTransform` and `ctx.mozCurrentTransformInverse` by doing the required competitions in JS. This is required to make text selection work in browsers, that don't implement these Mozilla/Gecko extension to the HTML Canvas spec.

Some quick measurements showed, that this slows down the rendering execution around 20-30ms on Chrome per page, which doesn't sound too bad.

---

The question is where to place this code. I talked to Artur about this and he is for placing this code in `compability.js`, as it adds compability to old browsers. However, if we add the code there, we basically have to add these functions to every canvas, which requires hacking the `HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.getContext` function to return a context, that has the new `ctx.mozCurrentTransform` and `ctx.mozCurrentTransformInverse` if it's not there by default.

Messing around with the prototype of a HTML element feels wrong to me. Also, this functionality gets added for every canvas in the current browser window, which might have side effects people using PDF.JS don't want (slow down of other canvas operations, that don't have anything to do with PDF.JS).

For that reason, I placed the code right now in the `canvas.js` file.

I think this is a great tool - when our extension is released into the wild, I believe this will offer a sample of (broken) PDFs that is more representative of our end-users' PDFs than those reported on Github.

I do have a suggestion on where to store and what to do with such PDFs that I think will ease the pain for _both_ users and developers: Store them into @brendandahl's corpus report framework.

If we use that framework we don't have to ask our users what's wrong with the PDF (as his framework already detects visual differences _and_ JS errors/warnings/todos), nor do we have to remember to close a number of issues whenever we fix a new feature (as his framework automatically ""closes"" a broken PDF by detecting a ""pass"").

As a side bonus, we get better statistics on the top errors/warnings/todos/etc that matter to our end-users.

At first I thought we could simply store them in our existing corpus. However, as wisely pointed out by @wfwalker: that would mean we'd be chasing an ever-growing completion metric, and therefore we should probably have two separate ""buckets"" - one for quarterly goals based on PageRank, and another for user-submitted PDFs.

http://postimage.org/image/yeych56wr/
## Why adding such a feature:
- using github issues to report broken pdfs doesn't scale and it's really hard to manage
- easier for people that don't have github
- ability to reach out for new contributors by adding a ""You can help!"" in the confirmation email
## Basic workflow:
- the user selects the ""Report broken PDF""
- the user selects the broken area
- the user fills out the formular
- the user submits the data
- the data is send using some chrome code from the plugin
- the backend sends a validation email to the reporter
- once the reporter clicks on the link in the email, the data is saved on the server gets more analysed
## Some basic thoughts:
- the aim is to store as less data as possible from the reporter
- the mail address is not stored. Once the validation mail is send, the email gets hashed and stored with the other data. That way we only know what one user sends us, but can't determ his identity. This is useful if someone spams the system using the same email address. Then we can filter this submissions out.
- there is no image data send at all - the reporter just sends the URL of the pdf, the page and the section, he marked, but no image data. As we know the area that is broken, we can figure out the area ourself. This way, we store less data from the user and storing some image data a unkown user sends us could get us into some ugly situations, if he sends us 'adult' material, that violates some rights
- once the link is confirmed, we run some basic analysis on the pdf to figure out, what parts are not implemented right now
- while sending the email, we can include some message like ""You know, PDF.JS is open source, please help us to fix this broken pdf!""
## Things missing:
- include the current build of the plugin the user uses
- include the browser userAgent string
## Current status:
- the current branch is here: https://github.com/jviereck/pdf.js/tree/feedback
- so far only the ""client"" form is more or less implemented
- I have thoughts how to implement the plugin-code to send the request to the server (we can't send the data from within the viewer.html itself, as of cross-domain issues)
- I have thoughts how to implement the backend using node.js
## Questions:
- Does it make sense to spend time on adding such a feature? During my talk at #mozcamp, it seemed like people liked to give feedback and report broken pdfs and if we can get more contributors that way was well, it might be worth it.
- Where to host the backend stuff? On the same AC2 instance the current pdfjs-bot runs?
- Everybody can submit any pdf link on the internet. We can check if the file is a pdf, but still we have to download it/make a request to a server. We can check if the url ends with "".pdf"", such that we don't lookup any kind of URL, but there might still be potential that someone abuses this feature.

Open `viewer.html` as usual to test it. Note that there's now a `<div class=""textLayer"">` on top of our `<canvas>`.

To see what's happening ""under the hood"", change from `color:transparent` to `color:blue` in `viewer.css: .textLayer > div`. (Warning: it's not pretty, it's hacky :)).

It's hacky because we can't simply add one (absolutely-positioned) `<div>` or `<span>` per word to the DOM as that would be prohibitively slow and memory-consuming. So we need some heuristics to render one `div` per `showSpacedText` line, and to make that DOM width match the canvas text width (I've borrowed some ideas from Crocodoc).

Another hack is that because of this width matching, we need to call `.offsetWidth` for every `<div>` we're inserting - which is _slow_ and _locks the UI_. So I'm rendering the text layer lazily using a combination of `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout`, so that we only render things when we have stopped loading pages for a while (currently 500 ms).

Known issues:
- ~~Apparently we're selecting glyphs and not characters, so sometimes things like `fi` are selected as a single character (try selecting e.g. the word ""difficult"" in the first line of `tracemonkey.pdf`)~~
- ~~Some characters display OK but are copied messed up (`pdkids.pdf`)~~
- ~~Some PDFs are not working at all (`i9.pdf`)~~

Help and feedback always welcome :)

**UPDATE**:
- Not working on Chrome (due to use of `mozCurrentTransform`)
- Now supports `f1040.pdf`
- ~~PDFs `i9` and~~ `pdkids` come out correct in the DOM text, but when copied to clipboard come out messed up. I suspect there's a problem with our font encoding. Perhaps after #717 lands this will be fixed?

- Now supports `i9.pdf`
- `f1040` has lost/messed letter spacing information (presumably from font). Selection still works for full sentences (as the algorithm aligns beginning-ending of sentences at all costs), but it's awkward for words.

730,2011-11-01 18:12:03,"Hey Julian, cool script, I like it!

Thinking more broadly about standards compliance, it seems like presently we have two separate routes for supporting PDFs:
1. Brendan's corpus report (based on PageRank); and
2. Individual Github issues opened by contributors (or by us)

I'm starting to think that we have neither the resources nor the incentive to support #2: we already have plenty of work to do with #1, while PDFs in #2 are likely not representative of the most popular PDFs out there.

My suggestion is to focus instead on #1 only, and close #2 altogether. I know this sounds radical, but as far as I can see that's the best solution from a cost/benefit standpoint. My guess is that otherwise we'll just end up clogging our Github issues with hundreds of broken PDFs that we'll hardly ever get to.

To sum up, by focusing on #1 alone we can design and address a corpus that represents the most important PDFs on the web, and not spend time solving potentially isolated cases.

Makes sense?

The following (comment) tags found in `src/pdf.js` and `web/viewer.html` will instruct the script to do its magic: `PDFJSSCRIPT_INCLUDE_ALL`, `PDFJSSCRIPT_INCLUDE_BUILD`, and `PDFJSSCRIPT_REMOVE`, which will respectively cat-combine all `src/*.js` files, `<script>`-include `build/pdf.js`, and remove the corresponding line.
- No more `make watch`, as this is now unnecessary
- `make production` depends on `sed`, but that's OK since contributors don't have to mess with the production script.

Some time in the near future the bot will periodically issue `make production` and update our `gh-pages`.

The font's are currently processed (new Font(...)) on the main thread and not in a worker as well, but let's keep it simple for now and get something landed.

Compared to the wish list from Chris on the other pull request, I've addressed some of the points, but some still stay opened:
- The worker functionality is disabled right now as the feature detection needs to get implemented
- The ""can we use UInt8Array as image data"" isn't implemented due to missing feature detection
- The PDFDoc and WorkerPDFDoc as well as the Page and WorkerPage object haven't merge yet, as this requires a complete refactoring of these objects and I don't want to break more stuff/refactore more code then I've already done with these patches. However, note that the current `PDFDoc` got renamed to `PDFDocModel` and `WorkerPDFDoc` is now `PDFDoc`. That way, we don't have to change any of the APIs as you just can call the new PDFDoc as you did before.

Architecturally, this approach still looks fine; looks like it hasn't changed from the previous patch.  The fixes you've made look good.  It looks like the comments about file organization weren't addressed, and I think Artur was confused similarly to me.  We need to figure that part out.

As for landing, I mostly agree with @arturadib's comments above.  We should land this with a functional worker backend.  When this architecture runs only on the main thread, I think we'll mostly regress throughput without much responsiveness gain, though there are some pdfs it could improve.

@arturadib @brendandahl @notmasteryet how well do you guys understand the architecture these patches are moving towards?  One thing we neglected in the previous pull request was getting the core devs on the same page; it's important because this change will permeate a lot of pdf.js, and affect the way patches need to be written.  I think the first ""action item"" is to make sure the new architecture is documented and understood.  @jvierek, want to start with a write-up and then post the link to the mailing list?

Next, we should figure out how the worker backend will interact with the code reorganization being planned (I haven't been following the details).  Maybe you guys could conf call next week to discuss?

With both of those settled, I think it'll be clearer how to get the current patch here ready to land, and it may make sense to distribute some work so that everyone gets a feel for the new backend.

Sound good?

> If the main problem now is that the UI sometimes freezes, a single all-in-one worker might do the trick - that way we don't have to break up the objects and deal with dependencies, etc. Have we tried this simpler solution yet to see if it solves our problem?

Yes, that entirely solves the responsiveness problem.  It doesn't mean we don't have to deal with dependencies: we still have to wait on fonts and images to load.  I'm not sure that a lot of lines of code could be removed from this patch, but it's likely that it could be made conceptually simpler.  Next week may be a good time to figure that out.

> Going for more than one worker today will only benefit a very small fraction of the market as most computers have 1-2 cores anyway. In fact, if we launch more workers than the number of cores things might actually slow down due to the message-passing and context-switching overhead. (I guess this will require some browser hacks to detect the # of cores).

Everyone (to a first approximation) has at least 2 HW threads, phones being the exception for the moment.  I wouldn't be surprised if 4 (dual-core+HT) is more common than 2 nowadays.  You're right that scheduling work is hard.  That's a bridge we'll have to cross, and we may need new platform support.  But we need to be able to scale up to more HW threads: that's where perf wins for this kind of code will come from from now on.  That doesn't mean we should neglect other wins like parallel rendering of individual pages, or same-page optimizations like SIMD.

@cgjones Does the performance will be really different between a SVG port and a HTML port? I know the SVG port is a bit slower than the canvas one, but I wonder how much we can reduce the difference.

Also it will not solve our selection problem that easily since we still need to 'guess' the page formatting before building a DOM if we want the selection to works correctly, but that's probably the same type of issue we will encounter with SVG.

555,2011-09-29 14:17:26,"Hi Kalervo,

`make lint` is definitely a feature I'll be pushing to the bot soon.

As for reference images, at the moment we're only using those with our bot, and unless you happen to have the same platform and browser as the bot, these are not intended to be used by users (you can check them out at https://github.com/arturadib/pdf.js-ref). 

The bot only generates snapshots for its own platform (linux), and it would be a nightmare to maintain images for all platforms (Mac, Win, Linux) and all browser versions our contributors use. (Snapshots differ across platforms due to different native fonts, anti-aliasing etc, and across browser versions, e.g. new canvas/SVG features, etc).

So for now we're assuming that all image tests will be run on the bot.

We can borrow Github's own workflow and start using Pull Requests also for code review/testing purposes. So if all you want is to run a test against a new feature you're working on, simply make a PR with something like ""DO NOT MERGE"" in the title, which will allow you to fire off bot tests against our image repo.

For now we're hoping to get a basic infrastructure and workflow in place, and iterate from there.

Thanks so much for your contributions, and please keep those coming! And feel free to shoot me a message if you need help with tests, etc.

Things haven't really evolved that way, but my personal rule of thumb would be to only split out code into a separate file that I 100% wanted to be a standalone library.  The font translation code probably fits that description.  It doesn't bother me that that's not how the code has evolved, though.  I don't care that much ;).

As for working with large files, I use multiple buffers in emacs to keep my place in multiple points in the same file, and it works just fine for me.  My experience has been mo' files mo' problems when working on JS for web pages (and other stuff, but that's a separate story).

I would rather use another mechanism for namespacing, when we get ready to offer an embedding API.  But if we can kill multiple birds with one stone through a module system, then sure.  I would tend to lean towards something more like the closure compiler (which we have nascent support for in the Makefile) than RequireJS, but I'm not religious about it.

The ultimate goal is to make sure the main branch here is always regression-safe. In other projects, contributors typically run their own regression tests before submitting a pull request. However, our regression tests in pdf.js make this impractical because:
1. Some of our reference PDFs are protected by copyright (so we can't make them available to contributors); and
2. Not everyone wants (or is able to) perform our really heavy cross-browser testing on their machines.

So a solution is to deploy a cloud node for carrying out these tests. One idea is to create a Git server on the node so that the workflow is more or less as follows:
1. User modifies the source in their own fork
2. User pushes their fork to our git server (a-la Heroku)
3. The git server launches cross-browser tests and reports back to the user
4. If tests failed, user goes back to 1., else continue
5. User makes a pull request to the main repo
6. Repo admin checks if last commit hash in the pull request matches a passed test on the git server (via simple web interface?), and makes decision to accept pull request

One characteristic of this workflow is that it gives the user the opportunity to make as many revisions to their fork as necessary before making a clean pull request, which reduces the load on our few admins.

Another alternative is daily/nightly tests.  But a problem with this is that it opens up the possibility that at some point in time our main repo will be dirty (i.e. won't pass regressions). Additionally, it might be harder to debug it as other changes might have been merged since the culprit was introduced.

What do you all think?

I opened the type1 and converted opentype fonts with fontforge and isolated the characters which were broken (E, S, s + many others). I looked at the type 1 charstrings for these characters and it seemed like the uniting characteristic was that they all called subroutine 4.

The problem seems to be with subroutine 4. The subroutine actually calls a othersubr, and from there I am pretty lost.

Basically, for format 4 subtables, the previous getRanges sorted the unicode values. But this meant glyph whose glyphIds are not sequential could be in the same range

Example
GID Unicode
1       1000
2       500
3       999

=>
Unicode          GID
[500]                2
[999 - 1000]      3,1

With this patch, ranges are divided up by both unicode value and glyph id value. Furthermore, the format 4 subtables now use idDelta to map to glyph id.

268,2011-09-11 19:10:39,"I'm only finding the PDFs that are created as scans of some documents. Is there other applications/uses of the JPEG2000 inside PDF container?

Those documents are really slow to load even with native applications. Looks like we need to setup partial resource load/display mechanism to update the page views.

@andreasgal and @wfwalker, I looked at the history of the JPEG 2000 in the Firefox, and interesting bugs were found. The https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=344620 points out in the comment 18 (by Henri Sivonen) that ""... it probably doesn't make sense to support JPEG 2000 or JBIG."". And looking at the https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=36351 comment 120,  Mike Shaver suggests ""... a careful analysis of the patent landscape, since by my reading the patent disclaiming only covered part 1 of JPEG 2000, and we would need to ensure that the selected library didn't implement other, encumbered parts of the format. ref: http://www.jpeg.org/faq.phtml?action=show_answer&question_id=q3f042a68b1081"" . Is the parent situation clear at this moment?

252,2013-06-18 21:07:07,"I have WIP for CalGray colorspace in here: https://github.com/kkujala/pdf.js/commit/a40b0ce35e1bf411d6064db6ac4ad7a02680df8d

It is not ready yet but it is much more inline with adobe than the existing implementation. Basically I would like to have some feedback if this is on the right track and some help in few issues. I've attached a manually created pdf that be used compare against other implementations. I'll extend the pdf later on with more pages.

Issues that I have.
- I cannot get exactly same colors when comparing to adobe in the simplest of cases (page 1). I suspect that I should use a different formula.
- When using higher gamma value (page 2) then the colors turn to black much more aggressively. Again likely due to formula.
- BlackPoint stumps me (page 3). How an earth should it be implemented.

So any help would be appreciated. @yurydelendik, can you help?

The comment by Eugene expresses very well what I was concerned about and I think he is right. For most use cases, a not canvas-based print solution for the web would be better, as styling a page/table/any content using HTML&CSS is way easier then implementing all the drawing, text breaks etc. in JS, although the browser knows way better how to do it. (Also, note that the +1 comes from Paul Irish.)

A WebPrintAPI as I have it in my mind fits the needs for PDF.JS, but I don't think there is much sense in implementing & standalize an API that is not useful for other use then PDF.JS.

Therefore, I think I take a closer look at CSS3 Paged Media and try to figure out what subset needs to get implemented to fit the requirements for PDF.JS. Also, once that's figured out, I want to ping Roc and discuss what he thinks about it/how to implement the missing stuff.

Not using the WebPrintAPI idea implies that the rendering needs to be done using SVG to get good looking printout. Right now I got the first page of the tracemonkey paper working on a very simple SVG backend for PDF.JS and the performance is not that much worth then in canvas.

Does that sounds reasonable?
