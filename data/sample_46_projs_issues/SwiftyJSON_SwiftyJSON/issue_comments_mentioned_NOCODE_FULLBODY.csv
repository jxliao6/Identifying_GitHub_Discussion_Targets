Honestly, I'm not sure if you need the latter part to get SwiftyJSON to work; as you can tell, I got that from an issue with getting AlamoFire to work -- and so perhaps fixed compilation of both pods.

2. Update the pod file (as mentioned in a previous post).
3. Run Pod Update.

After step 3, it didn't ask me to convert anything, and could build/run...I'm not sure what it could be if that's not working. Does the Pod Update say that it installed a new SwiftyJSON? Again, in case this helps, I'm getting from Pod Update this line (among others obviously):

In PODSPEC files (not PodFiles) you cannot define a git branch or a specific Repository. You can only define what is pushed to the specs repo with `pod spec push trunk` 

If you own your own library and depend on this one, there is no way to link to a fork unless the owner of that fork publishes the podspec to trunk.

People download my pod via their own podfile so the only way for them to get this is for me to have a step two which is add this other line to your podfile.

487,2016-11-22 03:51:46,"@zhigang1992 Looking at the code, it seems that we're gonna end up with a confusing API. For instance, to unpack a string you have

 - `json.string -> String?`
 - `json.stringValue -> String` with a fallback on `""""` if not found, potentially error prone
 - `json.requiredString throws -> String` which throws if the value is incorrect.

I would argue that we should be as strict as possible and leave the responsibility on the user to fallback on whatever is best if the value cannot be unpacked. This is why I'm proposing this unique interface:

 - `json.string() throws -> String`

It covers all the cases above:

 - `try? json.string()`
 - `try? json.string() ?? """"`
 - `try json.string()`

It also has the value to provide an explicit error if the unpack fail, as opposed to returning `nil` or a ""fake"" value. Imho it'll lead to more robustness in codebases.

Multiply that by a dozen times and it's not very nice, compared to the intuitive, obvious, and terse `j[""a""].int`. The priority, as far as the semantics go, should be developer intention and usefulness.  We're using SwiftyJSON to parse our _data_ and not _code_, and it stops just short of that goal by insisting that a string in the source JSON has to be parsed as a `String`, even if I know it is an `Int`. 

Everything starts out as a `String`, that's why we're using a library to parse it. The JSON spec may say that `""5""` is a string and `5` is a number, but I happen to know differently. I care whether an `Int` can be parsed from it, not whether or not _SwiftyJSON_ happens to know that it is an `Int`. Developer knowledge should trump naive type detection.

`json.arrObject = [""1"", ""2"", ""3""]` this works well, because type of `[""1"", ""2"", ""3""]` is `[String]`

`json.arrObject = arrJSON` this does not work when type of `arrJSON` is `[JSON]`. 
it has an compiler error `'JSON' is not identical to 'AnyObject'`.

I think the reason is in object setter of JSON struct



JSON here is an struct, but swift can not convert struct to AnyObject.

So I still not find any way to convert [JSON] to JSON clearly.

But there are some bugs in the pr like: should not ignore the NSNull, should call the isBool...
The most important thing is it's too slow to loop all elements in the self.object.

The [JSON](http://www.json.org) enum have few of structures not include the raw object.
The enums may not contain stored properties, but it is simple to store a lazy JSON property in oneself's code.




",tangplin,k06a
58,2014-10-01 09:07:58,"@tangplin, this example of `let json = JSON(object: raw)` where `raw` is parsed object:



your version of library parses whole hierarchy recursively to this:



but my lazy implementation for `let json = JSON(object: raw)` just did this:



when anybody access `json[0]` it returns:



and then accessing `json[0][""user""]` it returns:



and then `json[0][""user""][""name""]` it returns:



So it means only 10 enum wrappings instead of 17 wrappings.
And only 3 calls of `object as ClassName` instead of 17 calls!

My lazy solution wraps objects to JSON enum only if necessary. It removes recursion in `init(object:)` method and in property `var object`. So this operations works faster.

52,2014-09-23 00:39:45,"perhaps you are right @pvwoods however that scenario is very specific and unlikely.

I humbly propose to revise my scenario: 

TL;DR: just look at both Json Formats first is the correct one, the second is the invalid one.

This is a the good Json Format. 
    {""VehicleResults"": [{""Id"":""99494"",""StyleId"":""2123411"",""XrefId"":""1234"",""UseOptions"":""Y"",""StockNumber"":""5534343 "",""VehicleCondition"":""NEW"",""LocationCode"":""FLP"" } ] }

this is a correct JSON format generated by the HttpRequest from the .Net web Api. 

It seems okay when being glanced on the Browser like any debugging test you would do. 

However when this same HttpRequest is done over with Xcode, and in my case specifically with Swift. 
The string built with the Json format was this



this is the main issue. The backslashes infest the string in the string fetched by our iOS App HttpRequest.  The reason: .Net actually sends the string in that format, but is parsed when the browser displays it to the user. But only by the Decoder the Backslashes are literally still there but interpreted.

Now the first two double quotes you wonder why they are there, maybe. The thing is since its a string coming from the web apparently it add those quotes by itself on Xcode without the backslash. However they still pose a problem to the ""Invalid Json Format"" error that Xcode will haunt you about.

So yeah maybe in your situation is wouldn't work. Buy your scenario is very specific. Mine it can be common if you are trying to fetch data from a Microsoft Sql Database to display it on your iOS app.

But I like the approach more to connect SwiftyJSON to all targets where it is going to be used and only to make the `JSONValue` object public to be able to use `JSONValue` objects as part of public method APIs in frameworks.

I could add the `swiftyjson.swift` file to my target instead of importing it as a framework, but I don't really like it. That breaks implicit namespacing of Swift IMO. `JSONValue` would get added to my namespace, instead of staying in the SwiftyJSON namespace.

I also prefer adding Swift libraries as a project to my xcworkspace without changing the configuration/code. If I can do that, I can just add a library by using git submodules. Any updates I can just pull without worrying about conflicts.

Good point! @lingoer we should rethink public API and use cases of the library. Accepting both primitive types and `NSData` as well really looks confusing.

Maybe, it will be better to make the following public api:
- `fromObject` - converts json from NSJSONSerialization result
- `fromData` - which internally uses NSJSONSerialization to get object representation.

This will allow us to keep these two use cases separated

 - @LastSoul I ran your code and the JSON parses correctly, I don't get `nil`. Are you on the latest version of SwiftyJSON and if not, would you mind trying again with the latest version?
 - @selaysoysal Would you mind posting the JSON data you're trying to parse? Will make it easier to investigate
 - @merktassel @lucasderraugh I believe both of you are accessing `id` with the incorrect type. In one case, you're using `.string` instead of `.int`, and in another case it's the opposite. It would be easily confirmed if you could post the actual data that you're parsing. Let me know

There are implementations at least in Java and JavaScript.

For example, with [api.github/repos/../SwiftyJSON/issues](https://api.github.com/repos/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON/issues) you could get an array of the comments url using `$.. comments_url` to get an array of comment urls, or `$..[?(@staus=open)]` to get comments where the status is open.  The benefit of this being the safety provided by SwiftyJSON.

Just an idea, it's probably outside the scope, and would be better suited to an extension library.

But I also understand @tangplin's answer that there are too many different formats for dates in JSON APIs. So what about the idea to not deeply integrate dates into SwiftyJSON but at least add a helper method that makes getting dates from JSON objects much easier.

I have added an example implementation of what this could look like for dates formatted in String type. The user of SwiftyJSON would still need to provide the correct date formatter for the API he/she is using which solves the problem with too many formats (at least for String formats, but one could of course add support for Number formats as well).
