I would have though the `edgesForExtendedLayout` wasn't `all`. That would have explained it, but it's `all` by default and playing around with it doesn't help much.

You are right about the fact that other touch input are ignored because of the `singleTapGesture`, that is why this object is public so you can decide either to allow it to be recognised from the  `UIGestureRecognizerDelegate` methods.

I'm using the auto-created height constraint to update the height of the accessoryView to allow for the interactive dismiss to still work. Since that internal constraint is not animatable, I animate the content to the new height before setting the internal constraint.

Instead of overriding the delegate setter like @cyhsutw did in his comment, it's simpler to use `@dynamic` for the `delegate` property, so we let super implement it for us. Works like a charm now.

333,2015-12-22 18:09:13,"Yes, this isn't really a bug, but more of a missing support. This works out of the box when `inverted` is set ON because the tableView/collectionView is flipped, and auto-layout pushes the view up from the top, which doesn't modify the content offset, giving the impression that the scroll cursor moves along the text view when growing. Makes sense?
On the other hand, when not `inverted`, the tableView/collectionView moves from the bottom, without re-adjusting the content offset accordantly.

I agree this should be tweaked. I tried many times to add support for this case without getting into a great result. Will leave this one open as a reminder. Feel free to give it a try @adina-abduraman :v:

I probably won't get a chance to look at this again until the new year. It's entirely possible, however, that there are some other libraries and/or views that are causing conflicts with the SlackTextViewController.

`registerClassForTypingIndicatorView:` sounds like a good starts, following the same pattern than `registerClassForTextView:`, and this way, opt-in for a custom view.

I don't think it would be necessary to subclass `SLKTypingIndicatorView` to allow this, since `SLKTextViewController` isn't so coupled to that class. Instead, we could create a generic protocol wrapper:



These would be the required accessors to conform to `SLKTypingIndicatorProtocol`:

Now, the `initWithCoder:` isn't configuring constraints any views, just initialising the appropriate one (either a `UITableView` or `UICollectionView` instance). In `loadView`, the views are added to the view hierarchy and view constraints are configured.

#### Description

This bug happens when we try to prefill the textview with an ""@"" prefix and try to edit it or add more prefixes to it. When we go to add another ""@"" prefix and then select a suggestion, the selected suggestion text attaches itself to the start of the textview. 
#### Reproducible in:
- [x] This is reproducible in the sample project.

SlackTextViewController version:
iOS version(s): 9.3
Device(s): Simulator
#### Steps to reproduce:
1. Open workspace to edit the Messenger-Swift project.
2. Add textViewDidBeginEditing method.
3. Add textView.text = ""@Someone "" to the method.
4. Run the project. 
5. Find the cursor stuck on the ""@"" 
6. Try to add another prefix ""@"", select any auto complete suggestion. 
### Expected result:

Search suggestion when tapped should attach next to the cursor.
### Actual result:

You'll find the selected suggestion text attach itself all the way at the start of the textview.

If you're using a SlackTextViewController inside a UITabBarController, the keyboard appears _over_ the tab bar when the SlackTextView becomes first responder. Normally when the SlackTextView resigns first responder, the keyboard slides back down _over_ the tab bar, but when the SlackTextView resigns first responder via the swipe gesture, the tab bar suddenly appears on top of the keyboard and the keyboard slides down _under_ the tab bar, which looks really yucky.

It now uses KVO internally, observing the `visible` propery's changes to properly update the view constraints constants and animately present the typing indicator view.
By simply conforming to `SLKTypingIndicatorProtocol` required methods, it should be very easy to add any sort of custom typing indicator view.

I have added a custom typing indicator view to the sample project:

PS: Thanks @sveinhal for taking the initiative to do this! I felt the need to refactor your implementation for a more friendly approach. Observing the `hidden` property wasn't enough, since it would force the view to hide when dismissing the typing indicator. I have also taken the time to refactor and improve other related to logic to the default typing indicator view.

201,2015-06-11 11:45:35,"Hi, @dzenbot 

I created an issue before creating a pull request, because I want to discuss solutions before submitting anything. I am willing to produce the code necessary to close this issue, once consensus has been reached.

I want to customize the typing indicators to show small avatars instead of the user name list as the current design encourages. The `SLKTextViewController` currently instantiates and hold a reference to a `SLKTypingIndicatorView`. However, except for an `isVisible` and an `canResignByTouch` property the view controller couldn't really care much what kind of `UIView` subclass this view is (and long as it knows when to show/hide the view).

I'm thinking that we could extend the view controller to also have a method called `registerClassForTypingIndicatorView:` similar to `registerClassForTextView:`. But I'm not sure it's necessary to have it be a subclass of `SLKTypingIndicatorView`? I think that the view controller can observe changes to the `hidden` property instead of relying on the custom notifications. This also uses hidden rather than visible, which is more cocoa-y. And for the `canResignByTouch` property, we can either have the custom class implement a protocol, or move the logic to be a property of the view controller instead.

Alternatively, we could require that the custom class must be a subclass, but personally, I'm not really using any of its features.

What do you think?

Instead of only allowing collection view controllers, the new implementation is more flexible, accepting table view controllers too. It could accept any view controller in the future, if they respond to selectors `tableView`, `collectionView` or `scrollView`, but this seems fine for now. 
A new target has also been added to the sample project, to be able to test it.

One thing to understand is that the child view controller's subviews aren't added to the view hierarchy, except for the scrollViewProxy. This is meant to decouple the implementation of the view controller's from `SlackTextViewController`.

[Snapshot tests will be added soon, in this branch](https://github.com/slackhq/SlackTextViewController/tree/snapshot-tests).

I've been taking a look at the SLKTextView class, and I am pretty sure that it is a thing related to the moment when `[self refreshFirstResponder]` is called. 

I managed to avoid that in two ways, but I really don't like any of them:
- Disabling the  prediction by code on the SLKTextView.
- Always showing the prediction on it.

    I found that when I dynamicly change the placeholder for SLKTextView, the size for the placeholderLabel remain still. For example, I set ""ÂåøÂêçËØÑËÆ∫"" as the placeholder in viewDidLoad, but when I click a table cell, the placeholder would be changed to ""ÂõûÂ§çÂ®ÅÈúáÂ§©"". Then the textLabel would not be large enough to contain the five characters, since there are only four at first.

So do you think it is necessary to resize the label in both setPlaceholder and setFont which could both cause this kind of issue?

40,2014-10-13 19:23:02,"@hit1983 I think what you're asking is how to connect a tableview you've already added to your storyboard via an IBOutlet? 

Right now you'll want to let the SlackTextViewController create that for you so it can create it & properly set up the constraints. In order to tell slack what you want you'll use the default table view style. You can override this if needed.



From there you'll just override the delegate methods in your custom controller or set the delegate & dataSource to another class. Check out the example project.

You might be asking, 'well how do I have other things in the view beside the table view?' I believe the current intent behind this implementation is to have the entire view own the tableview or collectionview in order to properly handle scrolling & moving the text field.
