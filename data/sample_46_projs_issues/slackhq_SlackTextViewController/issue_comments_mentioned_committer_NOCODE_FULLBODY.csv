Note that the reason for my issue is because the image is actually within the section header, so the current autocomplete is only in the table view below.

Did you every try using the accessoryView and overriding addConstraint: to capture and modify the height constraint? If so any issues?

I'm using the auto-created height constraint to update the height of the accessoryView to allow for the interactive dismiss to still work. Since that internal constraint is not animatable, I animate the content to the new height before setting the internal constraint.

Instead of overriding the delegate setter like @cyhsutw did in his comment, it's simpler to use `@dynamic` for the `delegate` property, so we let super implement it for us. Works like a charm now.

I probably won't get a chance to look at this again until the new year. It's entirely possible, however, that there are some other libraries and/or views that are causing conflicts with the SlackTextViewController.

I'm so excited to use this pod but I'm afraid I am still experiencing this same crash as hretarekar, even on the latest release. It's the same log trace except a few of the line numbers have changed slightly. 

I cannot reproduce the problem in the sample project. Perhaps you can shed some insight based on my circumstance:
- I am programmatically instantiating my viewcontroller with a xib file.
- I have an IBOutlet from the tableview in my xib to my viewcontroller. 

I have experimented with including and tweaking the following methods but could not get anywhere:
`+ (UITableViewStyle)tableViewStyleForCoder:(NSCoder *)decoder`
`- (id)initWithCoder:(NSCoder *)aDecoder`
`- (void)commonInit`

Any advice?

If you're using a SlackTextViewController inside a UITabBarController, the keyboard appears _over_ the tab bar when the SlackTextView becomes first responder. Normally when the SlackTextView resigns first responder, the keyboard slides back down _over_ the tab bar, but when the SlackTextView resigns first responder via the swipe gesture, the tab bar suddenly appears on top of the keyboard and the keyboard slides down _under_ the tab bar, which looks really yucky.

- Renamed `hideInputBar:animated:` to `setTextInputbarHidden:animated:`
- Dismissed the keyboard and the auto-completion view right after hiding the textInputBar
- Fixed cases where hiding the textInputBar wouldn't be possible when the keyboard was up
- Avoided hiding the textInputBar with alpha, instead fixed some auto-layout constraints so the textView would follow the dismissal animation

Known bugs:
- when rotating the device, the scrollView's wouldn't extend to the bottom of the screen when the textInputBar is hidden.

Please try pulling this branch. Thanks for this great improvement!

201,2015-06-11 11:45:35,"Hi, @dzenbot 

I created an issue before creating a pull request, because I want to discuss solutions before submitting anything. I am willing to produce the code necessary to close this issue, once consensus has been reached.

I want to customize the typing indicators to show small avatars instead of the user name list as the current design encourages. The `SLKTextViewController` currently instantiates and hold a reference to a `SLKTypingIndicatorView`. However, except for an `isVisible` and an `canResignByTouch` property the view controller couldn't really care much what kind of `UIView` subclass this view is (and long as it knows when to show/hide the view).

I'm thinking that we could extend the view controller to also have a method called `registerClassForTypingIndicatorView:` similar to `registerClassForTextView:`. But I'm not sure it's necessary to have it be a subclass of `SLKTypingIndicatorView`? I think that the view controller can observe changes to the `hidden` property instead of relying on the custom notifications. This also uses hidden rather than visible, which is more cocoa-y. And for the `canResignByTouch` property, we can either have the custom class implement a protocol, or move the logic to be a property of the view controller instead.

Alternatively, we could require that the custom class must be a subclass, but personally, I'm not really using any of its features.

What do you think?

Then the textLabel would not be large enough to contain the five characters, since there are only four at first.
