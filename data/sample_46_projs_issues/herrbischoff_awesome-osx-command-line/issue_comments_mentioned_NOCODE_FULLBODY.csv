117,2016-11-03 11:46:52,"@napcae. Right. We're an El Capitan shop and have no expectation to even touch Sierra until 10.12.2+ reduces the support panic to normal levels _and_ all our critical tools support it. Neither of those conditions yet apply. Did they change the name of El Capitan and we just didn't notice? _That_ was my point.

44,2015-10-24 21:25:02,"@vinkla: Nice work. I'm wondering though why the badge still shows that the build is failing although it is passing.

Apart from that little hiccup, I think we should test both at least `setup.sh`, `brew.sh` and the sourcing of the `aliases` and `function` files. If all of them go smoothly, this would account for the most basic code glitches like missing colons, quotes and the like. It would also make sure that all Homebrew formulas are available and installing correctly.

I suppose you removed the pre-sudo check because Travis would otherwise complain, correct?

This automation is going to be a treat when finally set up. ;)

35,2015-10-23 07:49:52,"@vinkla: Interesting idea. Travis does support Mac OS as a testing target. However, writing effective tests for simple configuration changes could prove to be challenging, as there is usually no output. Also, Hardware-related tests will probably be impossible.

35,2015-10-24 18:26:05,"Alright, @vinkla: as of now you have push access to the repository. Use it wisely! ;)

I have set up a new branch `setup-files` for us to work with. I believe the structure should be self-explanatory. I use Vim as my main code editor so the files are tailored to this environment. To spare yourself and others the pain of having to adjust editor settings manually, there is also an `.editorconfig` file. Which should (given the correct plugin for your code editor is installed) adjust the code formatting automatically.

I believe the files should ultimately be in a separate folder which contains its own `README.md` with basic information about their intent and instructions on how to use them.

Let's see what we can create! I'm especially looking forward to how the Travis tests will run. They are set to run only when a `.travis.yml` file is present. So as soon as you add one, it's go time.
