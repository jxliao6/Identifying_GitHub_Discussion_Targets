@maximveksler: Please fix. Also, double-check what I've asked in my [previous comment](https://github.com/herrbischoff/awesome-osx-command-line/pull/58#issuecomment-152082229).

58,2015-10-29 17:33:20,"Thanks for the catch @rprimus.

@herrbischoff - yes, zsh is installed with brew. El Capitan won't let you edit /bin so my homebrew is set to /usr/local/bin which is not enabled by default Apple /etc/shells setup.

58,2015-11-03 23:19:46,"@unixorn: That's exactly been my experience on every OS X version including El Capitan. The only time I had to add something to `/etc/shells` was when using a newer Bash version, which is kind of logical given that OS X ships with a default version installed.

I'd like to hear other voices about their experience before merging this change. I'm still not convinced that having to add it manually is expected behavior.
",herrbischoff,unixorn
58,2015-11-04 00:16:42,"@herrbischoff Thinking back, I may have set my shell to brew's zsh using System Preferences instead of `chsh`, so that isn't necessarily a useful data point.

44,2015-10-24 21:25:02,"@vinkla: Nice work. I'm wondering though why the badge still shows that the build is failing although it is passing.

Apart from that little hiccup, I think we should test both at least `setup.sh`, `brew.sh` and the sourcing of the `aliases` and `function` files. If all of them go smoothly, this would account for the most basic code glitches like missing colons, quotes and the like. It would also make sure that all Homebrew formulas are available and installing correctly.

I suppose you removed the pre-sudo check because Travis would otherwise complain, correct?

This automation is going to be a treat when finally set up. ;)
",herrbischoff,vinkla
44,2015-10-24 21:32:01,"@herrbischoff The reason it show failing is because I pointed it against the `master` branch. 
",vinkla,herrbischoff
43,2015-10-25 07:05:23,"@herrbischoff what about pull request validation? For correct style and script? I can write some code for style check btw.

39,2016-03-30 15:44:01,"@herrbischoff please re-open, adding .plist didn't work for me either. @ryanshuck solutions works though
",mindfulmonk,herrbischoff
35,2015-10-23 07:49:52,"@vinkla: Interesting idea. Travis does support Mac OS as a testing target. However, writing effective tests for simple configuration changes could prove to be challenging, as there is usually no output. Also, Hardware-related tests will probably be impossible.
",herrbischoff,vinkla
35,2015-10-24 18:26:05,"Alright, @vinkla: as of now you have push access to the repository. Use it wisely! ;)

I have set up a new branch `setup-files` for us to work with. I believe the structure should be self-explanatory. I use Vim as my main code editor so the files are tailored to this environment. To spare yourself and others the pain of having to adjust editor settings manually, there is also an `.editorconfig` file. Which should (given the correct plugin for your code editor is installed) adjust the code formatting automatically.

I believe the files should ultimately be in a separate folder which contains its own `README.md` with basic information about their intent and instructions on how to use them.

Let's see what we can create! I'm especially looking forward to how the Travis tests will run. They are set to run only when a `.travis.yml` file is present. So as soon as you add one, it's go time.

22,2015-10-21 08:14:48,"@boneskull, good question, my opinion is to set link with short description, like:
`[.plist file](https://gist.github.com/your-gist)`
But @herrbischoff may have different opinion so let's wait for him.

21,2015-10-21 06:47:39,"@herrbischoff, it's ok becouse you already unloaded service, if you will load service back and try unload again, it will unload without any message, if you unload second time it will give you same message as you accrued.
Btw, I'm think that redirect to `/dev/null` is unnecessary too
