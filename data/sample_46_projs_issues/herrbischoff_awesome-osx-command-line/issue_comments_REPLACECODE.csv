Maybe the performance implications change if something like the [WebGPU proposal](https://webkit.org/blog/7380/next-generation-3d-graphics-on-the-web/) can be agreed upon but this still leaves the OS integration. For comparison, I doubt any advanced Linux/BSD/Solaris user is going to use a web-based terminal application for daily work. That's what xterm, urxvt and others are for.

Also, when using Homebrew, it resets the user:group of `/usr/local` to `root:wheel`, effectively removing write permissions for the current user. This breaks Homebrew. I may add this to the collection with this result as a caveat.

Especially after having test-driven Operator Mono, it strikes me as a work of designers who don't particularly understand the needs of developers. It's a style typeface, not a workhorse, more suited to designers than code monkeys like me. ;) A far better commercial alternative is Pragmata Pro. Camingo Code is alright but already present on the font list in this section.

Or we both could contribute to the existing one and help @aharris88 to make a proper awesome list out of his awesome list.

You should always work on a branch in a forked project instead of editing `master`. This way you always have the main branch clean and your changes are just in the branch. Actually, this is generally a good practice while working with Git.

Apart from that little hiccup, I think we should test both at least `setup.sh`, `brew.sh` and the sourcing of the `aliases` and `function` files. If all of them go smoothly, this would account for the most basic code glitches like missing colons, quotes and the like. It would also make sure that all Homebrew formulas are available and installing correctly.

I _thought_ mDNSResponder was necessary, but then while trying prevent more processes from calling home I ran across some pages discussing it and Bonjour and ways to disable it. Nowhere did they mention that mDNSResponder is essential and that entering the commands only disables the discovery ability, not actually mDNSResponder itself. Nor did they describe a method of testing to see if discovery was in fact disabled or not after entering the commands.

I'm not sure the steps are necessary anyway since checking the box to **Disable all incoming connections** in the firewall pane also blocks Bonjour.

I thought it might be good to share the open command on the list because it's one of those commands that new people don't really know and once they do they use it all the time. There are examples for opening a url, file, application and a directory.
