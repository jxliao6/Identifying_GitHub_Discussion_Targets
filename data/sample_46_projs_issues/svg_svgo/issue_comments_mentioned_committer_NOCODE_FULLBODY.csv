@ianchadwick By default minifyStyles should remove unused styles based on usage data. There are few exceptions:
- SVG contains `<script>` element
- some elements have an `on*` attribute (event handler)

If something from the list is found in SVG, minifyStyles decides that style removal is unsafe. You can force removal by setting `usage.force` option to `true` (see [example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/svg/svgo/master/test/plugins/minifyStyles.09.svg)).

657,2017-01-31 23:58:23,"@GreLI The ""hackish""ness is what gets introduced by [surprise] Adobe! Both tests pass though.

If you specify a `.class` (i.e. a layer name beginning with a `.` or an `#id` [layer name beginning with a `#`]), then once that SVG is exported from Illustrator, for some reason these become `_x2E_` instead of `.`, and `_x23_` in place of `#`…

The idea here is that it's useful to be able to specify which attribute you are targeting (with CSS say) just by naming the layers accordingly.

I suppose you could take the view as with #648, and say that this possibly falls outside of the scope of SVGO if it is focussed _purely_ on optimisation, but it is useful to be able to add plugins that solve problems like this into the build step, so I guess this is another argument for #564… along with other ideas for useful plugins such as adding an `<?xml-stylesheet` instead of inline `<style>`s, and/or adding `xlink`s to SVGs.",danielbayley,GreLI

655,2017-03-12 00:24:22,"I think @caub is right that the usage of global variables may be problematic elsewhere as well. For example, in the ""removeUselessDefs"" plugin, a global 'defs' variable is reassigned various times throughout the plugin's execution. When the plugin exits, the variable will continue to hold a reference to its current value. In this case, I don't think there will be any behavior changes... however, it does seem like at the very least there will be a temporary memory leak (i.e. the referenced element won't be garbage collected until the next time SVGO is run).

## Motivation
The purpose of submitting this PR is to clean up id attributes in SVG files by converting those id attributes to class attributes. If you include an SVG file with an id attribute more than once into an HTML file, that file has become invalidated because an id attribute needs to be unique. 

## Application
Design tools like [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) and [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/illustrator) automatically generate SVG files when exporting the designs. When a designer exports these SVG files, the design layers in the application append an id attribute of that layer name to the SVG. Therefore, the idea is to use `svgo` to clean up or optimize SVG files automatically generated by design tools for use in web applications. #494 is an example of this.

## Future Work
Let me know if this is something you are interested in pursuing. I understand if it does not align with the goals of `svgo` and we can close the PR.

Thanks for the response.

Essentially, instead of dynamically building a string which points to an unknown-until-runtime location in the `plugins` folder, all plugins which could potentially be needed should be required upfront and then only worked upon if needed.

I might be able to provide a PR at some point, but need to do some reading to make sure it works as expected. I'll end up doing that on my own fork hopefully sometime this week.

Talking to @guybedford about the issue he said:

> @MeoMix dynamic CommonJS requires are not supported because they are sync and the browser is async. Typically for these plugin patterns you want to ensure the module is already loaded by creating an async layer around it. Eg how we handle Babel plugin loading in the system-babel plugin, by first System.import'ing the plugins ourselves, then running Babel.

In any case, according to the [inkscape wiki](http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Inkscape_SVG_vs._plain_SVG), sodipodi-prefixed attributes and elements are metadata, rather than graphical information needed to render the image, so svgo should remove not just the prefix, but the whole attribute/element as well.

Of course, simplifying curves (which can at least make a reasonable attempt at preserving the shape of the curve while using less nodes) will generally produce more visually appealing results than simplifying the equivalent sequence of lines into a sequence with less nodes.

293,2015-03-19 22:46:06,"@littlefyr I do like your point of ""maximum significant digits"", but as @GreLI pointed out, a GCD is very infrequent in most realistic applications.

I'm having some difficulty understanding the relevance of your comments as it pertains to this particular feature request. While I understand and agree that modifying values is a delicate procedure, and that extra care must be taken to ensure that all values are scaled equally, neither of your examples appear to demonstrate the optimal markup using the suggested transformation, which would be:



This is 5.5% smaller than the example using the tenths place and 10.7% smaller than the example using the ten thousandths place. When gzipped, thats 1.3% and 4.2% smaller, respectively.

Of course, there are further optimizations that could be applied to the given example, but I'm hoping the simplicity of your examples will further illustrate the point.

I think you may be confusing some other optimization (rounding?) with the optimization I am suggesting; perhaps my use of the word ""precision"" in the title is the source of the confusion.
",joeyhoer,GreLI
293,2015-03-20 16:49:18,"@joeyhoer I'm piggy backing on your issue because what I am suggesting is effectively the same. 

While its true, as @GreLI says, that you would need to have a viewBox in order to do that, the viewBox only defines the coordinate of the viewport. If no viewBox is defined, you can use `viewbox=""0 0 width height""`.

One way to do this is to divide by a sufficient power of 10 that makes all the values between 0 and 1 (ok +1 and -1) round the value, to say 6 decimal places, and multiply by 10^6 (in this case).

The biggest problems are (and I'm not sure its not a problem) may be with some path constructs like Arcs. I've never used them, but when I tried building one of my examples, i naively tried multiplying all the values by 10, but the arcs broke. 

Also using different units like mm or cm would be challenging.

The reason why I wanted one path is is because the MVC framework I am using makes it cumbersome to insert multiple shapes and paths.

614,2016-10-14 18:23:53,"This fixes #504. There are definitely pros and cons to doing this, and am interested to hear your thoughts on what is best for the svgo project. My opinion, of course, is that this the pros outweigh the cons, but I can see the other side too.

**Pros:**
1. This makes svgo compatible with JSPM. Up until now, anybody who uses jspm and depends on svgo (directly or indirectly) has to create a configuration file in the jspm registry for _each version of svgo_. @MeoMix did this for svgo@0.6.1, and now I [have a pull request to do so for 0.7.1](https://github.com/jspm/registry/pull/987). Merging this svgo pull request will make it so that there will be no need anymore to create a configuration file in the jspm registry for each version of svgo.
2. This will make upgrading svgo to es6 modules (instead of commonjs) easier. I don't know if there are plans to do that or not, but once you switch to `import`, `System.import()`, or `import()`, you can no longer synchronously load dynamic plugin code like you can with `require`. Instead, you can either import all of the plugins upfront (similar to what I've done in this pull request) or you can change the [preparePluginsArray](https://github.com/svg/svgo/compare/master...joeldenning:issue-504?expand=1#diff-8f58d3f133adabc0050efa4a28cc5457R104) function to be an asynchronous function that returns a System.import() promise.

**Cons:**
1. The `pluginMap` is sort of an annoying manifesty thing that introduces one more step to the process of writing a new svgo plugin.
