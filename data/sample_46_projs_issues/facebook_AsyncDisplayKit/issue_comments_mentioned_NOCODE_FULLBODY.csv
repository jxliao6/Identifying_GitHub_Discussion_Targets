3169,2017-03-14 12:27:23,"@harryworld Thank you for your reply.  It is now clear that we are not on the same page.  I'm sorry about the confusion and let me try to explain better.

First, let's limit the scope of this discussion to item moves.  It's totally fine to work on section moves later on, even in a follow up PR.

You're right that moves should be treated similar to reloads in the sense that `_ASHierarchyChangeSet` records them as-is and let other components (`ASDataController`, `ASTableView` and `ASCollectionView`) decide how to process them.  With that, I believe a valid implementation consists of 4 independent steps:
  1. Record move updates into a change set.  They should be recored as-is and not be split into inserts and deletes.  This is because a change set should be regarded as the source of truth, which sadly has not always been the case.  How an update will be processed later on is not the responsibility of this step and thus it should not care about it.
  2. Validate the updates.  In this set we care about whether the indices in all updates are valid.  As a result, for each move, we have to validate it such that:
     - Its ""from"" index is valid in the original index space.  It means we have to merge the index into indices of original delete updates and validate.
     - Its ""to"" index is valid in the future index space.  That means we put it into the list of original insert updates and validate.
  3. `ASDataController` to process moves.  The goal of this step is to make sure the internal properties of ASDataController is correctly updated.
     - It's important that for a move, we don't throw away the existing (often visible) node and load a new one which I believe is what currently happening in this PR and triggers the assertion [here](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/3169/files#diff-fb6dadff65468c53595c164828199c83L422).  Even if we manage to silent the assertion, we'll need to make sure the new node has the same states as the previous one.  And then I think it's inevitable that a flash will occur while the new node is being rendered.  The flash will be especially bad for an interactive move. 
     - I believe the correct implementation of this step needs to be implemented in `-[ASDataController _updateElementsInMap:changeSet:]`.  We need 2 smaller steps:

       3.1. Grab the node at the ""from"" index path of each move and store it into a temporary storage but use the ""to"" index path as key to indicate the future position of this node.  Then we put the ""from"" index path into a list of other deleted index paths that are originated from delete updates, sort them in descending order and remove items at these index paths from the provided element map.

       3.2. Collect all index paths from both move updates (""to"" index paths) and insert updates, sort them in ascending order and insert items one by one. For each index path, either grab an existing node from the above temporary storage if available, or  populate a new one (in case of original inserts).
     - Regarding supplementary nodes, we can delete them as part of step 3.1 and repopulate as part of step 3.2.  Aggressive reloading is not ideal, but it has been the case for other type of updates and improving it is not the scope of this PR.
  4. `ASCollectionView` and `ASTableView` to forward all move updates to their super as-is.  This step is pretty straightforward.  The general rule is that we should always forward original updates.


After having a concrete implementation for native item moves, we'll be in a pretty good shape to implement section moves.  We'll also need to revisit the need for separate delete and original delete changes in `_ASHierarchyChangeSet` (as well as insert and original insert changes).

Please let me know if there is anything unclear.  As our working schedules don't overlap much, feel free to go ahead with implementing any steps and we'll discuss more on the actual code. Thank you!

3163,2017-03-14 16:24:53,"@davitPiloyan93 Your flash is unrelated to the one described in this issue.  Your project is not using IGListKit and it is using ASDK 2.2 in which flashes caused by `reloadData` is a known issue.  That being said, the real reason your image nodes flicker is because you don't provide a default image /placeholder color and a fading duration.  Also your actual image is too big which takes a while to be render off main and once that finished, the buffer is swapped immediately and that causes the flashing effect. You can simply eliminate it by these 2 lines:

The solution is to adopt the `ASPagerDelegate` and implement `willDisplayItemWithNode:` and `didEndDisplayingItemWithNode:` methods. And inside these methods you call either `startAnimating` or `stopAnimating`. Make sure your interactions with the `UIActivityIndicatorView ` happen on the main thread.",EviluS,aaronash
3142,2017-03-06 15:50:57,"Ok this is pretty interesting ...

The problem is that if a `UICollectionViewCell` is getting it's `prepareForReuse` call it calls `_removeAllAnimations`. This will remove the animation for the `UIActivityIndicatorView` as it's overwriting this method and `stopAnimating` is called. If the `UIActivityIndicatorView` has `hidesWhenStopped` set to `YES` as it's by default the `UIActivityIndicatorView` will just disappear. Otherwise if you set `hidesWhenStopped` to `NO` the view will stay but the animation is gone.

3134,2017-03-04 05:02:57,"@Adlai-Holler I have also had issues with 0, 0 layouts.

It does seem important though that this method behaves consistently, e.g. a user should not have to know if the layout pass has occurred for waitUntilAllOperationsAreCommitted to ""work"".  We really should rename this method, but I would guess the desired semantics are like ""flush"": ""ensure UIKit is completely up to date with the current state of the asyncDataSource, whether or not initial load has happened, and including any edit operations recently performed""",appleguy,Adlai-Holler

3134,2017-03-04 21:46:42,"@Adlai-Holler: thanks for working on this. 

I forced a layout pass in '-waitUntilAllUpdatesAreCommitted' to avoid a breaking behavioral change in that method. Many users have used it as a way to ensure all updates were ""flushed"" and the collection/table is up-to-date with its data source. Our tests also relies on this behavior. But now that we do native reloadData, that expectation won't be true until the next layout pass happens.

Renaming is probably a great idea. I'd prefer a breaking API change that the compiler will pick up over a silent breaking behavioral change.

3127,2017-03-03 10:16:53,"Thanks for your reply @Adlai-Holler !

Yes sorry about that, I didn't make myself clear but I figured that `shouldBatchFetch` would be called every time. What I meant is that I have no real way of knowing whether new items are available, except by making a call to the remote service. And apart from these inconvenient edge cases, the existing batch fetching logic seems to be the way to do just that, and suits my needs perfectly. In the general case, when the user scrolls down, a new batch fetch is triggered only once (if needed), I make the call to the remote service (which may or may not return new items), and voila !

Now concerning the two edge cases, do you think it is the developper's responsibility to take care of this in `shouldBatchFetch` or could the logic in `ASBatchFetching` be changed?
- A solution to avoid spamming the remote service would be to ensure a delay between calls. This might be needed anyway depending on the application, and it is clearly the developper's job to implement that.
- However a complementary solution would be to check whether the batch fetch was triggered during a bounce animation (and disable the repeated calls). This implies checking `contentInset` and `contentOffset` of the scroll view. It would seem that this would be more adequate inside `ASBatchFetching`, and in my opinion would be a legitimate improvement. :-)",flovouin,Adlai-Holler
3127,2017-03-21 13:57:30,"Hey guys,

So currently I've simply solved the problem by adding the following logic to `shouldBatchFetch`:



- `isScrollingUp` is necessary even though the check already exists in the current `ASDisplayShouldFetchBatchForContext` implementation because it is bypassed when `hasSmallContent` is `YES` (the second case of my original issue). This could simply be solved by moving the `isScrollingTowardHead` check above the small content check.
- `isBouncingAtTop` is also pretty much self-explanatory and solves the first case of the original issue. This could be added to ASDK's logic, although the `contentInset` should be forwarded to `ASDisplayShouldFetchBatchForContext`.

It shouldn't be too hard to add this in `ASDisplayShouldFetchBatchForContext`, and I feel that it would be at its place in the batch fetching logic. What do you guys ( @appleguy @Adlai-Holler @maicki ) think? Is this PR-worthy? I don't mind taking care of it if you think it is, just didn't want to work on it before asking you first.

You could check if there is an overridden display method in that case though, perhaps that is safe to do ... would be a lot less costly than trampolining a call for every node.

 I assume we set this only through the instance variable during initialization, and if there are no other calls to the setter property in the framework, it is probably safe for performance to add the gated check. ",appleguy,garrettmoon

- These are put into an ASMutableElementMap and I believe this does make it to _pendingMap (but it's a bit hard to tell since it is copied)
- However, at the time of the crash, the _visibleMap object that is being queried by UIKit does not have _any_ supplementary elements in it...even though we've reported that some exist to UIKit.

3053,2017-02-21 07:51:35,"@skensell great report.  Question: why is your cell node a different size from the cell containing it?  I don't recall why this change was made, but I know it was because of a situation that required being able to set the containing cell color.

It is possible that this only makes sense to do for opaque colors, to prevent blending or bleed-through of unintended content beneath.  But I agree with you, ideally the ASCellNode is the same size as the parent and it wouldn't matter.

Lastly, it's really expensive to use cornerRadius on a cell, so consider if you can use an ASButtonNode or ASImageNode with [UIImage as_resizableRoundedImageWithCornerRadius:].  It works with semitransparent background colors and also content showing through behind the corners, as long as the background color is flat (single color, even if alpha) and there aren't any views moving through the inside of the corners that need to be clipped.  http://asyncdisplaykit.org/docs/corner-rounding.html .

Of concern here is the inner 90 degree corner on `_ASCollectionViewCell` and the rounded corner of its node within (which has the same frame).

I do think there should be at least one major release where the method remains implemented, but internally just uses the workaround you wrote (constrainedSizeForCalculatedLayout, layoutThatFits, layout.size).  After users have a short period to make the changes, then it could be removed entirely.

This suggestion is based on seeing a rapid pace of users still upgrading from 1.x to 2.x; I'm helping folks with the process at least a couple times a week.  It's a huge incentive for people to upgrade when they can stabilize their app on the new version first, and then fix all the deprecations in a separate pass.

Could you post a screen capture video, taken with QuickTime Player? (It can record from device too) . This way our suggestion can be most applicable since there can be more than one cause.

If you can take a Time Profile of scrolling on the iPhone 6 and then attach a .zip compressed version of it, I can suggest optimizations quite easily too.  Or send it to me on Slack.

Important: it is unsafe to modify the items array on a background thread and then dispatch to main to update the collection.  The modification of the data (e.g. items) MUST occur at the same moment / inside the performBatchUpdates: block itself.  It is possible that this is one of the causes of the flashing issue too.

Lastly, as a debugging step, try adding reloadDataImmediately in your viewWillAppear method, and make sure you've set reasonable backgroundColor values on your cell's subnodes so the placeholder state looks reasonable (e.g. on each ASTextNode).  If you would rather drop frames than see placeholders, you can enable .neverShowPlaceholders on each ASCellNode before you return it from the nodeBlock.  http://asyncdisplaykit.org/docs/synchronous-concurrency.html",appleguy,mosquitodu

3045,2017-02-21 07:57:00,"@skensell it is not currently designed to affect subnodes.  If this isn't clear from the documentation, we should definitely improve the comment / docs around it.

I do think it would be valuable to have a recursive version.  If you are interested in implementing this, it would be very easy to add a new bit to ASHierarchyState that controls this.  Internally one would call enterHierarchyState: and it would automatically get propagated to children.  You could have each level (in setHierarchyState:) perform self.displaysAsynchronously = YES / NO;

If you have an ASPagerNode or collection or table, you probably are looking for ASCellNode .neverShowPlaceholders.  This API works extremely well and is faster than displaysAsynchronously because it is truly concurrent: http://asyncdisplaykit.org/docs/synchronous-concurrency.html . I apologize the name isn't better :)

Please let us know if this addresses your issue (at an app level, if you can use neverShowPlaceholders) -- also message me on Slack if you're running into issues.

If your app issue is resolved, we can treat the task as a feature request for recursive displaysAsynchronously = NO (or, put more simply, a generalized API to supercede neverShowPlaceholders that works on all ASDisplayNodes rather than just ASCellNodes).  I think it could be achieved in a way that does support synchronous concurrency, which is a more tricky technique to implemented that had not been done before at the time the simple displaysAsynchronously switch was added (it's been around since the earliest pre-launch version of ASDK, whereas sync concurrency is just a year old).",appleguy,skensell
3045,2017-02-21 11:31:32,"@appleguy Thanks, it looks like `neverShowPlaceholders` is what I was looking for.  Interestingly, setting it on the `ASViewController` node didn't have any effect, but setting it on the individual `ASCellNode`s did work for me.

When your table reaches the top or the bottom you insert a new section at index `0` or `n + 1` (depending on the loading position) with one cell which will display the `Loading UI`. Once you are finished loading you delete that section. 

Another option is to add a `subnode` behind the table and only show it when the `update` criteria is met but with that approach you will have to deal with `table offset` manually.

3039,2017-02-21 06:23:52,"I was looking at this code recently with some of the Yoga stuff (setting flattened on the layouts created that way, since they are already flat).  It's definitely key for performance, which IIRC is the main reason the flattened flag was added (maybe we should add comments internal documentation about this, since it's unusual?)

The great thing about ASLayout is that it provides an incredibly powerful & useful hook for both developers' own custom layouts (calculateLayoutThatFits:, etc) and entire layout engines to be integrated.  I bet we could even use it in the new ""ASCollectionLayout"" (or ASLayoutManager) class.

Because ASLayout is the #1 most frequently created ASDK object, it's a worthwhile pursuit to make it as fast as possible. The good news is that after the perf work that @maicki did last year, ASLayout is now quite well optimized!",appleguy,maicki
3039,2017-02-21 19:53:59,"@maicki and I discussed and agreed on the changes in this PR before he pushed it, so I accepted it a bit too fast. 

I think we're looking at 2 different flags here:
- `visited` flag set to a context and used solely by the traversal algorithm to avoid processing a context multiple times.
- `isFlattened` flag **persistently** set to an ASLayout object to indicate that it doesn't contain non-node-based layout elements.

The fact that we merged these 2 flags into one `isFlattened` flag is problematic because as @maicki said, ASLayout objects now can't be reused.

After looking at this method again, I started to wondering if we need either of these flags at all! Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think `visited` is not need because of the way our DFS algorithm is being implemented. `isFlattened` is not used anywhere, even though the flag itself makes perfect sense. So I've been testing a slightly different implementation of this method against the test suite proposed in this PR and ASDKgram. It works perfectly so far.

Both @Adlai-Holler and @maicki are the de-facto experts on ASTextNode these days, so I'll leave it to them to make the call on safety of taking this change.  However, we're all interested in seeing improvements to a few nagging correctness issues that still affect the component and so will seriously consider any PRs in this area.

One last suggestion: consider adding this to examples_extra/TextStressTest?  Not a blocker for this PR, just a suggested followup.  I've been trying to collect our known ASTextNode bugs there and then the fixes so we can run the app to check them.

Regarding the Jenkins failure, totally happy to fix that, only I'm admittedly not completely sure what's going wrong there. Seemingly the `#import`s are messing up; did I expose `ASLayoutManager` incorrectly? (I publicized it in the podspec and added it to the aggregate header file.) I don't believe I touched `ASControlNode`, though…",christianselig,Adlai-Holler
3008,2017-02-13 23:03:37,"@christianselig It looks like you need to mark `ASLayoutManager.h` as public in Xcode (open the right panel and change `Project` to `Public`.

Heads up, though: there is a very reasonable chance that we will stop using NSLayoutManager in the future. TextKit has major limitations and issues that have caused [other frameworks](https://github.com/ibireme/YYText) to drop down to CoreText, and we may have to as well.

If that happens, you can always use `will/didDisplayNodeContentWithRenderingContext` to perform your own custom drawing.

Rather than making this the designated initializer for the class, let's add:

",Adlai-Holler,christianselig
3008,2017-02-14 01:12:38,"@Adlai-Holler Totally fair, reading through some of the comments in the TextKit classes I can totally see where you're coming from. 😛 Any idea when you'd look to doing this? 3.0? Later? If it's decently near, I don't mind leaning on the `will/DidDisplayNodeWithRederingContext` blocks instead.

Two quick questions:

- With `will/didDisplayNodeContentWithRenderingContext`, I find drawing in `will` results the additional drawing being cleared when the text is drawn. `will` is preferable as it allows me to put the drawing underneath the text. `did` works, however, but I need to change the context's blend mode, not sure if that's optimal. You can see what I'm talking about by adding something like this to `init` in the example project I attached:

`

- If you still feel like it's worth putting this in in the interim, I'm not sure I understand your suggestion re: designated initializer. What does exposing that property do if it's not writable? Is it intended for subclassing?",christianselig,Adlai-Holler

- Let's consider how much it interferes with refactoring.  In particular, I don't think we should remove the Inspector or Example code (but just move them to an experimental/ folder instead, which is a directory we could find useful for newer pre-Beta features too).
- It probably makes more sense to remove the ASDisplayNode level integration, but that doesn't mean that all code which is otherwise ""out of the way"" also must go.
- I think we all agree that debugging tools around layout, especially visualization, would be one of the most incredible capabilities that has ever been added to ASDK...and, for better or worse, it is very much **needed** as developers struggle every day on this.  Many hours lost trying to figure out tiny issues.
- Since the visualization support does work, but it's mostly the editor / example environment that wasn't complete, IMO we should put it on ice until it is revived.  This is on the assumption that whether it's next month, or a year from now, it's almost certain that we'll eventually want this functionality.

That said, I wouldn't suggest that anyone spend many hours carefully preserving the functionality.  Instead, do you think there's a reasonable way to ""move aside"" any code that's in the way, and then break the integration with ASDisplayNode?",appleguy,maicki

`ASCellNode` is always preferred. However, for code bases that have hundreds or more custom `UICollectionViewCells` subclasses, this feature will allow them to port to ASDK more easily, and then slowly convert their backlog of cells to be `ASCellNode` subclasses. 

This change allows mixing both those un-ported `UICollectionViewCell`s and `ASCellNode`s without a performance penalty for the `UIKitCells`. In addition, it still provides of `ASCellNode`, including automatic preload, asynchronous measurement and asynchronous rendering. Because of this difference in performance, app developers will clearly see the value of porting cells to `ASCellNode` and be able to do so over time.

I'd be happy to help review & collaborate on the Layout cleanup diff this depends on, both because that cleanup is a great step in itself, and also because it will allow us to land this and close out two PRs that make nice steps forward :).

I will very likely be able to take on the Yoga integration test, although due to an offsite next week and other projects at the moment, I think it will take until the first week of February to start.  I may get further delayed, but I think it's surprisingly feasible that we might have a prototype by mid-Feb!

Personally, I think keeping the ASLayoutSpec API is an absolute must.  It should be possible to use the Yoga ""style"" through an explicit .children array that is different than .subnodes, but I really do think ASLayoutSpec should stick around.

I already have in mind exactly how they can be ""powered"" internally by Yoga, with trees that exist separately at each level in the node hierarchy and calls into them are driven by the -calculateLayoutThatFits method (the C structs from Yoga would be converted into ASLayouts, and most critically, the *Measure function pointer that Yoga has will be connected to something like layoutThatFits: on each child node -- which will continue the recursive propagation into calculateLayoutThatFits:/calculateSizeThatFits:, while also flawlessly encapsulating the .preferredSize / .layoutSize integration you masterfully integrated into the constrainedSize calculation stage!!",appleguy,maicki

Although adoption was not completed, I feel it would be *very* valuable (and is great, flexible code) if we can get ASInterfaceState and ASHierarchyState into the ASEnvironment struct, as was originally intended / in-progress when we had to jump to other projects.  This wouldn't need to be done right now, *and* I do still agree that removing *layout propagation* from ASEnvironment makes sense.

One reason I say this is because the integration idea I have for Yoga will almost certainly be able to use ASEnvironment as a central mechanism for keeping the Yoga tree up to date with the ASDK children tree.",appleguy,maicki
2941,2017-01-30 18:44:29,@appleguy Yes for now we should get rid of `ASEnvironment` it is trivial to write this kind of tree traversal without having to hook into another system like `ASEnvironment`. Look how I replaced the trait collection system that used to use `ASEnvironment`.,maicki,appleguy
2941,2017-01-31 19:07:04,"Nice! Thoughts:

- Since we don't support macOS and there aren't plans to do so, I think we shouldn't land any OSX-oriented code.
- Some of the names are verbose. How about:
   - `ASLayoutElementTraitCollection` -> `ASPrimitiveTraitCollection`. This conveys that it is a struct version of the class `ASTraitCollection`.
   - `ASLayoutElementTraitEnvironment` -> `ASTraitEnvironment`. This mirrors the `UITraitEnvironment` protocol and the word `Trait` is unambiguous within ASDK.
   - `progagateNewLayoutElementTraitCollection` -> `propagateNewTraitCollection`. Since the format used for propagation doesn't matter, we can omit it from the name.

I asked @maicki about this and he said that this is expected behavior, although we could definitely improve our documentation around this. 

`ASLayoutSpec` is essentially an abstract class, _except_ for its one use as a flexible spacer (when used with no children). If you want to use `ASLayoutSpec`, you'll need to subclass it and implement a few methods (see any of the other layout specs for an example of that.

2926,2017-01-25 18:57:22,"@appleguy The only way I have been able to trigger that warning is to use the C++ compiler to compile `NSArray+Diffing.m`. The cast is invalid under C++ because arrays aren't exactly pointers.

If you add this to the top of `NSArray+Diffing.m` I bet it will trigger:



So we have three options:
- A. Land this diff
   - Pro: Easy!
   - Con: Lots of malloc/free calls
   - Con: Leaves the door open for future incompatibilities between your C++ build environment and our other `.m` files.
- B. Open a new diff that makes `NSArray+Diffing.mm` into a C++ file that uses a C++ heap-allocated matrix a la http://stackoverflow.com/a/21036413 except on the heap.
   - Pro: Clean! One call, no memory manipulation.
   - Con: Bigger change, more C++.
   - Con: Leaves the door open for future incompatibilities between your C++ build environment and our other `.m` files.
- C. Modify the build system you're using to ensure it compiles `.m` files using a C compiler.
   - Pro: No code change.
   - Pro: Formally correct – other incompatibilities may arise if `.m` files are compiled under C++
   - Con: May be a huge hassle for you.

2926,2017-02-11 05:38:18,"@Adlai-Holler As far as I can tell, the only way to force the C compiler to be used there would be to create a separate Bazel build target -- an actually separate static library -- so it wouldn't actually address the problem with other files.  I'm definitely worried about this because I didn't realize it was treating it differently than the mainline build.

However, since this has never occurred before (at least for any existing code), it raises the question: should we ever write C code that doesn't compile under C++?  In terms of portability, and in the spirit of the project's already-strict warning settings, _and_ given the widespread usage of .mm -- it seems like we should strive for C++ compatibility.

Let me know your thoughts on this.  I could close this PR if you see a better way to do it, or update it to use a vector or something else.

In most cases, you are transitioning from an initial state in which some subnodes are present, to a different state in which some of them have been removed and some others added. However, I would have thought that the difference in a preferred layout size would count as a different layout tree. The way you implemented this may have been incorrect though.

2842,2016-12-29 22:13:08,"@jennibunny - This is a great question! I don't have a great answer for you, however, I can point out a few differences. 

`.flexBasis` - specifies the initial size for this object, in the stack dimension (horizontal or vertical), before the `flexGrow` / `flexShrink` properties are applied and the remaining space is distributed. 

- Because flexBasis only works in the stack dimension, which could be either horizontal or vertical, `.flexBasis` could control either the width or the height of a flex object. 
- As far as I know, `.flexBasis` also doesn't apply to absolutely-positioned items - e.g. ones in an `ASAbsoluteLayoutSpec`.
- `.flexBasis` gives an initial size (either width or height depending on the stack dimension), meaning that if .flexGrow or .flexShrink are enabled, that size could grow or shrink.

`.preferredLayoutSize`  -  Provides a suggested relative size for a layout element. An ASLayoutSize uses percentages rather than points to specify layout. E.g. width should be 50% of the parent’s width. If the optional `minLayoutSize` or `maxLayoutSize` are provided, and the `preferredLayoutSize` exceeds these, the `minLayoutSize` or `maxLayoutSize` will be enforced. If this optional value is not provided, the layout element’s size will default to its intrinsic content size provided `calculateSizeThatFits:`

I'll see if I can find more info on the difference between the two.",hannahmbanana,jennibunny

What about having something like a `ASViewControllerNullNode` that would act like a proxy and this would be used as root node for the `ASViewController` and has a reference to the view controller if no node is given? In that null node we would just not do anything I guess in case we call method's like `layoutThatFits:` but if the view is accessed we actually would return the view from the view controller. I would have to lookup in the `ASViewController` implementation what we exactly would need, but I think that would be a bit _cleaner_ solution.",maicki,nguyenhuy

In case users don't provide ASViewController with a node (by using `-initWithNibName:bundle:` or `-initWithCoder:`, I create a default node that simply loads an UIView. And so the node is non-optional as it has always been. This introduces a small overhead but helps reduce complexity of ASViewController. The overhead might even encourage people to opt-in to a node backed hierarchy and take full advantage of ASViewController.

I tested this approach with ASDKgram and didn't find any problem. Given the fact that we currently don't even support `-initWithNibName:bundle:` or `-initWithCoder:`, this change shouldn't cause any new regression on existing codebases and thus it should be safe.",nguyenhuy,maicki

The strange thing is the fact that in previous version of ASDK it have worked as I expected. Nothing about it found in release and migration notes. Now it just works with other logic. =(

>And the maximum width in this case is the screen width.

But, in my case maximum width is the stackSpec's width. And, because stackSpec can not stretch this two elements with fixed sizes, its maximum width limited by maximum width of its elements. Isn't it right?
It was so in ASDK 1.9.x but not in v2 =(",stephenkopylov,nguyenhuy
2787,2016-12-16 14:13:47,"@stephenkopylov I think you are right that there has been a behavior change here. For 1.9.x, vanilla ASDisplayNode layout code would return the bigger value among `_preferredFrameSize` (which is zero by default) and `constrainedSize.min` ([code in 1.9.2](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/e344f03608887d150607b854dc0fe5efad6580ec/AsyncDisplayKit/ASDisplayNode.mm#L2070)). While on 2.0, since we deprecate `preferredFrameSize` and actually don't even have an ivar for it, [`constrainedSize.max` is returned](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/AsyncDisplayKit/ASDisplayNode.mm#L2691). Sorry we missed this hard-to-detect behavior change. We need to update the change log and/or migration guide. cc @hannahmbanana @maicki .

> because stackSpec can not stretch this two elements with fixed sizes, its maximum width limited by maximum width of its elements. Isn't it right?

Yes, that is right ([code here](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/AsyncDisplayKit/Private/ASStackUnpositionedLayout.mm)). But in this case the separator is the longest element because of the above new behavior. It's longer than the 2 buttons. The stack actually asks those buttons to stretch, to which they refuse because they have a fixed size . Does this explanation make sense?",nguyenhuy,stephenkopylov

2782,2016-12-19 04:41:03,"Here's my feedback, although I don't intend for it to be definitive — I'm interested in understanding what behavior @maicki would prefer we support.

## 1. The internal complexity of ASNetworkImageNode
- Is important to consider and aim to reduce.  However, I believe it is *essential* that internal complexity not be a factor in the API design.  The reason is that there are sufficiently many clients of ASDK (over 1,000 developers regularly interacting with it), so that some increase in internal complexity would suggest we should invest in a refactor rather than affect the API.

## 2. There are exactly 3 cases to consider ASNetworkImageNode with:

Note that in the last case (both are set), we *must* provide *identical behavior* regardless of call order — therefore, regardless of implementation complexity, the decision on API behavior is only for the ""both"" case and doesn't care about the order.

### a. Just .URL
This behavior is simple.  It should not change from the prior implementation.  If externally *read*, the .image property will become set after the URL has loaded.  Likewise, the rendered version will be cleared when exiting the Display range, and the .image property itself will be cleared existing the Preload range.

### b. Just .image
This behavior is also simple, but doesn't work correctly in 2.0.  When just the .image is set and .URL is *never* set, the class should behave like ASImageNode.  Why?  Several reasons:

- many, many clients (including all over Pinterest) have already relied on this behavior.  That's because it's intuitive and very frequently convenient for app developers.
- the convenience for devs is highlighted by the case of PIImageNode.  It would be very difficult if we had to create a separate subclass and ensure even brand-new developers *always* use the base vs network class in the right situation.
- It would also make it more difficult for us to add features internally.  E.g., a network-loaded button background, or even the future ASVideoNode that doesn't subclass ASImageNode — they would each have to carefully manage a Network vs Non-Network node to support both the direct-set asset / thumbnail as well as the URL-based option.

### c. Both .URL and .image.
The case of BOTH .URL and .image set is less clear.  However, the case is clarified by seeing there are only two reasons a user would do this:

- they want to load the URL image but are providing a cached or smaller version of the image to ""prime"" the view,
- the code is incorrect and inconsistent.  I don't believe there is a use case where the .image should take precedence over the .URL, especially because there are memory risks to doing this (ASDK can't yield the memory, so it should only ever be used with small icon-like assets and these almost never have .URLs)

So lastly, this diff is a suggestion from @garrettmoon for how to make 2c. less ambiguous while still being VERY strict at preventing developers from mistakenly entering the ""2c2"" case.  The idea is that this will behave functionally identical to ""it's not allowed to set both URL and .image on a Network node"", *but* provide users *a technically-possible way* to support the commonly-useful pattern of ""priming"" a network image node.

## 3. To make this call (which would increase impl. complexity), let's look at the use case
What's causing this to be so important?  It's transitions that upscale photos, including the exact case @rcancro is working on right now with Pin Closeup's standard zoom-in.

Por these, it is *essential* to support upscaling a low-res photo *while immediately kicking off a new high-res download,* as well as *async-displaying the new version*, as well as *swapping in the high-res version as soon as it's done, in a seamless way*.  This behavior is super useful because it is so hard to handle at an application layer.

This was a very, very key use case that AsyncDisplayKit was architected to excel at in the pre-1.0 days, with ASMultiplexImageNode bearing the complexity of the use case.  However, Multiplex has fallen into non-maintenance, and so we have two paths to choose at this point:

- Let Multiplex continue to fade away, and probably become deprecated (e.g. we don't need to spend any time on it).  Support basic transition use case with something like ""ephemeralImage"", or simply using the .image + .URL combination as a simple implementation for this.
- Alternatively, plan to revive Multiplex and refactor it to share more code with Network.  Simplify Multiplex API so the ""common transition"" use case can be done more easily than the current dataSource-based API.  Keep NetworkImage as simple as possible and do not allow transitions to be performed with it.

In the case that a client set's an URL and an image it's less clear, but the thinking is to reduce the state and the side effects it can have it should actually work this:
1. If a URL is set it behaves like an `ASNetworkImageNode`. If an image should show before the image did load from the network it should be assigned to the `defaultImage` property and *not* the `image` property directly. The same way as the `ASNetworkImageNode` works as of today. I don't see any reason why we should support setting an `.image` as temporary image directly if there is already the `defaultImage` ... that said `defaultImage` is a really poor name for what it actually is: a placeholder image before the image did load from the network.
2. As soon as a developer assigns an image (doesn't matter if an URL was set before) the node will be transformed to an `ASImageNode` and the old state will be discarded.
3. If an `.image` is set and a `URL` will be set  the node will be transformed from an `ASImageNode` to an `ASNetworkImageNode`. The `.image` will be removed replaced with the `defaultImage` until the image did load from the network and replaces the `defaultImage` as `image` as the current `ASNetworkImage` does work.

### Why this behavior?
Imho, the behavior above is clear to describe as well hopefully reduces side effects for all kinds of quirks that can happen and added complexity we have to implement in case we want to support setting and `.image` as well as an `URL` and if someone is crazy also setting a `defaultImage` at the same time.

### Summary
To summarize the states:
1. Setting an `URL`, the node will become an `ASNetworkImageNode` and it works the same way as currently. If the developer would like to display an image before the final image did load from the network, it should use the `defaultImage` as it's currently the case. All previous state is discarded as soon as a new `URL` is set.
2. Setting an image directly to the `image` property, the node will become an `ASImageNode` with resetting all previous state like the `defaultImage` or the `URL` that was maybe set previously.",maicki,garrettmoon
2782,2016-12-21 10:48:38,"As already discussed extensively with @garrettmoon my thoughts around the behavior of each of the cases for an `ASNetworkImageNode` are:

### a. Just .URL
Agree with @appleguy ... no changes: This behavior is simple. It should not change from the prior implementation. If externally read, the .image property will become set after the URL has loaded. Likewise, the rendered version will be cleared when exiting the Display range, and the .image property itself will be cleared existing the Preload range.

### b. Just .image
Agree with @appleguy: This behavior is also simple, but doesn't work correctly in 2.0. When just the .image is set and .URL is never set, the class should behave like ASImageNode.

2782,2017-01-03 23:52:31,"@garrettmoon Sorry to bother, but could you rebase this when you have time and we'll land it?",Adlai-Holler,garrettmoon
2777,2016-12-15 15:44:28,"@leotumwattana In one of our projects I had to implement a similar feature. The behavior was a single line of editable text node and when you start typing it will grow up to three lines. When it exceeds the max number of lines it will stop growing and start scrolling. 

The implementation is:
- set a preferred frame size for the editable text node (defining the max height)
- adopt the `ASEditableTextNodeDelegate`
- implement the `editableTextNodeDidUpdateText:` method
- create a variable in which you will save the calculated content size of the editable text node
- in each call of the `editableTextNodeDidUpdateText:` check whether the text has grown and relayout the text node.

Basic example:
- Lets say that we need maximum of `3 lines` and assume that the point size of the font is `20px` so our max frame is `60px` height.
- If we have `1 line` we will layout our node to fit.
- if we have more than `2 lines` we will limit our node to the max height so that it can enable its scrolling.

Sorry in advance if my implementation is not explained clearly. There are probably better implementations but this one works for men. If you need any additional help you can contact me in the ASDK Slack I am `gpetrov` there.",EviluS,leotumwattana
2777,2016-12-15 16:27:53,"@EviluS Thanks. I'm thinking of making it a little more seamless, since this really does sound like something more than I alone will use. As @appleguy mentioned in his talks, `ASKD` is now going beyond just providing performance, but also convenience for framework users.

Looking through ASEditableTextNode.mm, I'm thinking of extending `ASTextKitComponents` with something like:



Using `layoutManager.lineFragmentRect` to loop through and find the line fragmentRect that corresponds to the maxLine. That should give me a more accurate height than using a fixed font's point height. Especially since I'm expecting mixed fonts, use of Emojis, Chinese Characters, paragraph styles, etc.

Anyway, with that in place, I can modify ASEditableTextNode's `- (CGSize)calculateSizeThatFits:(CGSize)constrainedSize` to calculate the height using the existing method if `maximumLinesToDisplay = 0` or the above if `maximumLinesToDisplay != 0`.

Anyway, the only issue I have is that I'm absolutely not familiar with Objective-C. It generally makes my eyes glaze over 😝 . If this was Swift, then I'd be able to try this out right away. Haha. So now, I'm going to wait on my friend who's more Objective-C literate to help me out tomorrow (HKT). 😉

2777,2017-02-23 15:09:52,"Hey guys, Awesome feature. Thanks @leotumwattana. There's a bug with it though: The way you are measuring text does not take into account the `textContainerInset` property.   For example, try `_textInputNode.textContainerInset = UIEdgeInsetsMake(4, 15, 4, 15);` and you will see that it doesn't expand even when there is one line of text + <30pts of new text. :(  Maybe I'll create a new issue...

2773,2016-12-19 04:49:02,"Regarding crash vs assertion.  I think we need to develop a better way to log assertions in production, but I disagree they should be crashes by default.  IMO we should develop a new macro for this case and offer two things to app developers:

- A #define switch to turn these special types of logs into hard crashes in production (off by default)
- An override where they can log nonfatal, e.g. with Fabric, so that the logs are still visible and problems are discovered in production.  This could be registering a block, like +[ASDisplayNode setNonfatalHandlerBlock:] or something.

I think this is fairly important as a default, because the vast majority of these cases happen with newly-developed code and have a relatively minor problem when the frame is not set.  In most cases, teams (at any company) would prefer to get /some/ experiment data rather than have to hotfix the app to stop crashes or get initial data collection.

2771,2016-12-14 17:03:38,"@appleguy @nguyenhuy This will resolve the issue, but it feels kind of hacky.

Since the issue we're addressing only presents under iOS 8, should we have two separate code paths? This introduces pretty significant overhead into a highly-optimized method.

We have no guarantee that all nodes will go through this system – for example, in Pinterest some node classes have code in `-dealloc` that enqueues subnodes onto an application-level deallocation queue.

Let's remove that product code and roll with this. If other problems present in the future, we'll go from there.",Adlai-Holler,nguyenhuy
2771,2016-12-14 17:27:14,"@Adlai-Holler I've just pushed a new commit that avoid strongify/weakify. While it is true that this fix introduces overhead, the biggest performance impact will be in case that `-releaseObjectInBackground:` is called on a background thread. This case is exactly why we need this fix in the first place. I think it's a fair trade-off between safety and performance. In case `-releaseObjectInBackground:` is called on main, the overhead is not that bad as `ASPerformBlockOnMainThread()` is quite performant and is used everywhere anyway. I can even tweak it to avoid block allocation.

I'm not sure why this system doesn't catch subnodes that are enqueued onto an application-level queue, since `-releaseObjectInBackground:` is the only public API of ASDeallocQueue. I may be missing something obvious here. Could you please elaborate?

Last but not least, while it is true that the crash we're seeing in Pinterest app only occurs on iOS 8, I'm worrying that we haven't achieved correctness in the current implementation. It is entirely possible for developers to lend a node to UIKit classes and then UIKit associates some unsafe-to-be-deallocated-off-main objects to the node. Making a node a UIScrollViewDelegate is an example, although its side effect can only be seen in iOS 8. So I still think a fix is necessary, now or later.",nguyenhuy,Adlai-Holler
2771,2016-12-14 17:43:52,"@nguyenhuy In fact, as I think about this, this unfortunately won't fix the majority of cases.

For instance, let's say you have a view controller with `vcNode` and one if its subnodes, `subnode`. Let's say `subnode` becomes the scroll view's delegate (which is likely). When the view controller is deallocated (on main) it will enqueue `vcNode` onto the deallocation queue, but `subnode` will not have its associated objects cleared.

Unfortunately this code path just isn't used for most nodes. It's used as the _jumping off point_ to trigger entire hierarchies to be deallocated.",Adlai-Holler,nguyenhuy
2771,2016-12-14 17:53:10,"@Adlai-Holler Oh yes, that's true. And we can't do something like this in `-dealloc` because we can't retain `self`:


Looks like the only way to fix this is to have a blacklist of associated keys. Gonna close this PR. Thank you!",nguyenhuy,Adlai-Holler
2770,2016-12-18 06:09:51,"@IvanChan Hey, ASDK throws an assertion in this css because you are passing in CGFLOAT_MAX as min and max size. You have to  remember, that what you are passing in is a size range and if you it in the way you do in your example what you basically pass in is:

`CGSize textSize = [self.textNode layoutThatFits:ASSizeRangeMake(CGSizeMake(100, CGFLOAT_MAX), CGSizeMake(100, CGFLOAT_MAX))].size;`

So you pass in  for min and max height a value of `CGFLOAT_MAX` what is not allowed. instead try this:

`CGSize textSize = [self.textNode layoutThatFits:ASSizeRangeMake(CGSizeMake(100, 0), CGSizeMake(100, CGFLOAT_MAX))].size;`

Furthermore never use `calculateSizeThatFits:` directly!

2740,2017-01-12 20:06:23,@modLX4 - were you able to resolve this issue? ,hannahmbanana,modLX4
2740,2017-01-17 08:01:51,"@modLX4 - `M13ProgressViewBorderedBar` is a `UIView` subclass. `UIViews` are limited to running on the main thread, whereas ASDK's `ASCellNode` nodes can run on a background thread. The `FeedCellStyleVote` `-init` method may be run before the node has had its view created. Thus, you shouldn't access `self.layer` or `self.view` in this method. Check out the [subclassing](http://asyncdisplaykit.org/docs/subclassing.html) documentation for more info.

When using views within an ASDK node, you have 2 options:

1. Create a node from the UIView by using the `-initWithViewBlock` / `-initWithLayerBlock` initializer method on a node. A benefit of this is that the view can participate in the -`layoutSpecThatFits:` layout API via it's node. You MUST set some sort of size on the node - e.g. `node.style.preferredSize` or similar sizing option. ***(preferred)***

2. Create the view in the `-didLoad` method. Add it with `[self.view addSubview:<the view>]` and you will need to do manual layout by implementing the `-layout` method. ***(second best)***

Due to the length in time since this issue was active, I'm going to close this thread. Feel free to re-open this issue or another one if you have further questions. I hope you have enjoyed using the framework!

2713,2016-12-08 13:10:40,"@maicki here you go - I've taken that exact class and stripped it down a bit, in case it's something very specific to the way i'm animating things or something like that. Look at the bottom of `ModalViewController.swift` for the class `HeaderNode`

",tomizimobile,maicki
2713,2016-12-08 17:35:55,@tomizimobile I looked into this into a bit more details today. The important change we did with 2.0 is to shift the responsibility to resize a specific node of a hierarchy to the supernode of it. In this case as you use a layout transition within a cell the cell is responsible for updating it's size based on the new layout. Unfortunately you don't update the size of the node in your `animateLayoutTransition` implementation. You can see the right behavior if you just call `super.animateLayoutTransition(context)` or instead of calling `transitionLayout()` call `setNeedsLayout()`. In case of `setNeedsLayout()` the display node internally will update the size to the new layout without calling the layout transition api.,maicki,tomizimobile
2713,2016-12-08 18:32:40,"@maicki huh, I didn't know that just by calling `super.animateLayoutTransition(context)` it would perform all the necessary animations for me by default, neat! I don't think that was available when I initially did this. I'd much rather just call `transitionLayout...` and not override `animateLayoutTransition` at all. I've got a couple concerns with that though. 
- ~Can I customize the speed of the animation? It looks like the nodes move at a different rate than the cell resizes~ i found the answer, `defaultLayoutTransitionDuration`
- In that project, the title of the button `follow` changes based on the state, and it doesn't seem like it's resizing properly. If you change line 212 in `ModalViewController.swift` to `follow.isSelected = true`, you'll see after the transition that the new title is cut off, because the initial title is smaller than the title after the transition. (It works fine if I override `animateLayoutTransition` and add `follow.setNeedsLayout()`, but I figured this would be handled)",tomizimobile,maicki
2713,2016-12-12 18:32:15,@maicki can you investigate for 2.0.1 and punt if necessary?,garrettmoon,maicki
2713,2016-12-15 14:16:31,"@tomizimobile Hey I looked a bit more into this and there are a couple of ways to prevent this:
1. You can call `follow.setNeedsLayout` to the follow button before calling `super.animateLayoutTransition(context);`
2. You can call the layout transition api with should measure `async: false`: `transitionLayout(withAnimation: true, shouldMeasureAsync: false, measurementCompletion: nil)`.

The problem currently could be that the follow button is get a layout pass before we call through with the new size due to the async nature. The transition api will be one of main focuses for 2.1+ that I will work on and I have a couple of ideas to tackle this kind of problem. I think as the this problem is not related anymore to the main title / issue I will close this issue. @tomizimobile can you please open a new issue with the new issue (text truncating), we would appreciate it.

2694,2016-12-06 00:29:46,"@maicki to @nguyenhuy 's point -- I think it is true this may extend node lifecycle, and we should at least schedule another 2.0.1 task to address that.

One strategy would be to schedule a runloop queue item to clear the pointer to the ASLayout, if by the time the queue item runs, it still should be cleared.  This is similar to how we call didExitDisplayState (clearContents) on NON-range managed nodes -- we schedule it the moment they're removed from the parent, but we re-check once the block runs, and sometimes they've re-entered a new parent by that time so we skip the clearing.

That said, the main concern would be ultra high volumes of block dispatches and retain / release if this happened on every node.  So as long as we make sure that, in practice, it doesn't occur when a full node hierarchy is being destroyed (e.g. the parent of a large tree is released) -- and we have some way to detect this case (e.g. ""removeSupernodeDueToDyingParent"" - and not schedule the cleanup in that path)...then it should be a good solution for the more rare, manual removeFromSupernode calls.",appleguy,maicki

2694,2016-12-06 16:22:15,@appleguy Can you give it another look. I decided to move a property for the time for caching the sublayouts as we called the `cacheSublayouts` in a class initializer and so we had to use `->` to access or set the instance variables of the layout.

Furthermore if the hosting view is smaller than the 300 it will still use the 300 to layout all of the children.

2636,2016-11-21 21:20:42,"@Adlai-Holler Some answers:
- We don't rely on a `setNeedsLayout` call for the node to layout. As soon as the frame changes a layout pass will happen and we use the frame of the node to execute the layout pass now. What is your thinking behind it?
- It should work with `initWithViewBlock:` nodes as the view will be assigned as view to the node. Layout does not rely on any `setNeedsLayout` call anymore. We call `layoutThatFits:` in `viewWillLayoutSubview` or if the `constrainedSize` will change due to frame changes we use the frame within the node to layout the subnodes if a layout pass happens.
- I changed to set the autoresizing mask to `[.FlexibleWidth, .FlexibleHeight]`. We still call `layoutThatFits:` in `viewWillLayoutSubviews` to prepare the node for the layout pass otherwise we just delay the measure pass to the layout pass. It should not have any overhead as if the frame didn't change it's a no op. We could push this layout async in the future, but I actually already plan to look into that doing it within `ASDisplayNode` by default.",maicki,Adlai-Holler

2629,2016-11-19 03:39:31,"@flovouin Hi!  Thanks for filing :)  I replied on Slack, but this is a good place for more information too.

> @flo I'd need to learn a bit more about what you're trying to do - may be helpful to hear concretely what you're doing to transform the URL to tell what could support it.  I'd recommend looking for -didEnterPreloadState (using 2.0-beta.1 or master) and at that time, generate the URL.  Basically use a custom subclass of ASNetworkImageNode, set your ""sourceURL"" on it, and then have the conversion to the ""true"" URL happen at a stage earlier — then set the actual .URL property to the correct URL.  If it isn't too expensive to do the conversions then definitely just do them at node init time instead, but doing them at Preload time will result in only the minimum number of URLs being converted (same number as will actually be fetched) so this should work
",appleguy,flovouin
2629,2016-11-22 11:52:38,"@appleguy Thanks for the quick reply!
I set `imageNode.URL` to ""fake"", internal URLs e.g. `assets/thumbnails/1234`. A ""service"" in my app is in charge of converting these to actual remote URLs, by choosing which API end point to call with proper credentials e.g. `GET foo.com/thumbnails/1234 Authorization: 4321`. The remote end point then returns a temporary URL (a signed CloudFront URL).
I was hoping I could do all that without having to pass credentials around, hence by only specifying `assets/thumbnails/1234` to the image node (and then using a custom downloader).
If you find this workflow convoluted I couldn't really hold it against you :D The reason for this is partly based on the fact that I must do something similar for videos (using a `ResourceLoaderDelegate`), and that in this case I don't really have a choice. However I've found a solution that works great and clearly separates concerns (although my explanation of it might be a little foggy).

Now the second bullet of my original question is also something I'd really like to be able to do: manually add an image to the cache. Indeed, some of the images might be generated locally, and in this case I'd like to be able to set image in the cache for key `assets/thumbnails/1234` (again, preferably without having to specify actual remote end points). This would avoid an unnecessary remote request, that might fail if the image is still uploading or if the user has no connection at that time.

All of this boils down to two features:
- Being able to specify a downloader for which I could asynchronously redirect my fake URLs, while keeping its behaviour as close as possible to the default downloader when it comes to fetching the remote resource. (But the resource would have to be cached as the fake URL, not the temporary one.)
- Being able to manually add an image to the cache for a given fake URL / key.

By looking at the code of PINRemoteImage I've got a few ideas on how to achieve this, but it looks like I would have to rewrite a lot of error-prone code, that has already been battle tested in PINRemoteImage. I therefore posted this issue to ask you guys if you could think of a solution that would keep as much of the default behaviour as possible.

Cheers,

(P.S. I use the word ""feature"" but this is by no means a feature request. I just thought that given how long my post is simply to describe the issue, this would be a better fit for GitHub than Slack. :-))",flovouin,appleguy
2628,2016-11-22 08:33:26,"Can someone describe an example use case where a single-child layout needs a different style than its child? I haven't come across such a case yet.

I'm not sure which is better:
1. Removing the `style` object:
which would make the affected layouts inconsistent with other layouts
1. Linking the `style` objects of the layout with that of the node:
which might give the impression (from a user's perspective) that you can actually set different styles.

In any case, I agree with @lappp9, I also think of those one-child specs as extensions to the styles basically. Although, I would still want some of them to be separate from the `style` object.

One downside to automatic style propagation for _just_ the single child specs is that it may cause confusion.

- In `didEndDisplayingCell:`, call `willMoveToParentViewController:nil` and then `removeFromParentViewController` on the cell node's view controller.

I filed #2633 for followup on a smaller issue where we may find it is possible to change one of the conditions, but I've confirmed that this change would require at least some other adaptation in the code, and it's not worth blocking the diff on since there aren't any certain use cases where it causes an issue.

Landing to master to promote further testing.  We can ship this with beta.2 as a tag initially, get some active developers trying it out, and then push beta.2 as a cocoapod after a few days.

I guess we won't have much choice but to invest significant effort at some point. I'm sure it will improve a lot of things. Maybe there is/will be a guide or other assistance once we get there.

At least this explains why it works as long as the text includes highlighted links, and why my attempt to insert an invisible link didn't fix anything. Presumably you're checking whether the styling varies and optimizing when it doesn't. But now that I understand that, maybe I can find another workaround in 1.9.92.

2572,2016-11-08 06:52:57,"@rajeevwhiz your problem appears to be that you're fetching the image thumbnails as a data model - e.g. you are fetching the image data before the photos are near the screen, which uses a large amount of memory.

Instead, your ASImageNode(s) in each ASCellNode should be allowed to do this data fetching.  If you write a custom class, you can override didEnterPreloadState and didExitPreloadState to perform this data loading and clearing to manage memory efficiently.

If you are integrating with the Apple Photos.framework, I suggest looking at ASMultiplexImageNode, which has native / built-in support for Photos library URLs.  It does this loading for you automatically.  You can configure the ""tuningParameters"" of the ASCollectionNode to load a different distance ""ahead"", both for loading the data and decoding the image, if you want to control memory usage in more detail.

I'm not too familiar with Swift <-> Obj-C interoperation, but you'll need to create an ASCellNode that contains an ASMultiplexImageNode (and handles its layout).

While testing this, please use the 2.0-beta.1 release.  This is available via a git tag by that same name (see adoption specifics if you're using cocoapods here; it's also available via Carthage.)  http://asyncdisplaykit.org/docs/adoption-guide-2-0-beta1.html

https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/releases/tag/2.0-beta.1

2566,2016-11-10 00:19:41,"@chrisdanford Thanks for the feedback!
- I absolutely want to avoid a setter interface, for the same reason that React and others do. Usually _one_ object knows how the screen should look, and so we should always ask that object when we need an update. Otherwise developers will have to wire up all that on their side, which will get ugly.
- A continuation interface is interesting but for the reasons that I mentioned in ""Performance Considerations"" our updates must be synchronous. I know it's a hard pill to swallow but otherwise we simply cannot ensure that we're in sync with the user's data source.
- Good point that we need to adjust the API or add assertions to prevent users from doing what you described and attempting to pre-compute data.
  - I considered making the API something like `collectionNode:configureNewData:` and pass in the data object. I couldn't think of a great name for it so I bailed, but as I type it out right now it sounds great. Thoughts?
- As I mentioned in ""Performance Considerations"" this solution is performant even for thousands of items. With more detail:
  - For items that existed in the previous data, `addItemWithIdentifier:` is:
    - 1x `[NSDictionary objectForKey:]`
    - 1x `[NSMutableArray addObject:]`
    - 1x `[NSMutableDictionary setObject:forKey:]`
    - 2x misc `objc_msgSend`
  - For new items, `addItemWithIdentifier:` is that, plus:
    - 1x `[[ASCollectionItem alloc] init]`
    - 1x `Block_copy`
- I'm interested in disallowing `reloadData` or having it go the diffing route when possible. I think the latter is the way to go.
- I don't think we should make this a wrapper – I think this should be the _de facto_ way to use ASCollectionNode. If we can't make it fast and flexible enough for that, then we should simply abandon it.
- (On the problems with `invalidateItemWithIdentifier:`) Good point. We could roll with this as-is, and if we discover a use case that requires it we can revisit.
",Adlai-Holler,chrisdanford
2566,2016-11-10 09:52:44,"I think the solution is super useful. @Adlai-Holler, thanks for introducing this!

In order to remove the need for `performBatchUpdates`, we still have to deal with the `update` calls. The current implementation doesn't cater for that, and I think that developers would assume that it somehow does.

For this case to be covered, I would think that having something like the `invalidateItemWithIdentifier:` method is needed. But perhaps we could call this method `updateItemsWithIdentifier(s):` instead. Alternatively, we could add a `shouldUpdate:` bool (or `forceUpdate:`) to the `addItemWithIdentifier` method.

What do you think?

We took a similar approach and used the diff method within ASDK to setup the batch updates. But that still seems to cause some issues every so often. Think we can move to this approach pretty quickly within Buffer for some wider testing.

",garrettmoon,danielrhodes
2546,2016-11-09 09:17:02,"@danielrhodes ASTableNode and ASCollection node are going to call `nodeBlockForRowAtIndexPath:` or `nodeForRowAtIndexPath:` for every row in the data source, from the main thread, whenever the initial data load happens.

By default, the initial data load will happen during the first `-layoutSubviews` call on the table/collection node's view. By calling `scrollToRow:` before that first layout pass, triggering the initial load at that time. Those calls to `nodeBlockForRow:/nodeForRow:` are not what is taking so much time.

Unfortunately, if you attempt to scroll to a row that has not been propagated into the view, we wait until the initial data load is finished before we can scroll. UITableView is not very good at virtualization – if we were to ""fake it,"" that is insert the last 20 rows and then scroll you to the bottom of THAT, and then attempt to insert the other 3980 rows above those asynchronously, we would interfere with the user's scrolling because we would have to set the content offset of the scroll view.

What Apple's Messages app does, which we could eventually attempt to generalize, is to add a loading spinner above the first batch of content, and then _wait_ for the user to stop scrolling and insert the next chunk of content/adjust the content offset simultaneously at that time.

Short answer: at the current time, the best way of implementing this is inverting your table view as you have done. Slack does this as well, for what it's worth 🙂

I'm not too familiar with the core issue that was discovered (that lead to this diff), but it certainly would be nice if scrollableDirections weren't required to be overridden by all subclasses.  If the base class could provide an implementation that works for most cases — like relying on contentSize, which has to be set for scrolling to work properly anyway — that would be great!

2541,2016-11-14 13:13:10,"@Adlai-Holler: Awesome PR! It's a much simpler approach to fix flashes. 

I think we can improve this technique to cover cases in which the visible patch is not the first patch. We can queue up all laid out nodes and insert them all at once when the visible patch is ready. What do you think?
",nguyenhuy,Adlai-Holler
2541,2016-11-16 01:29:26,"@nguyenhuy I think that is the ideal approach, but we have an architectural issue to resolve before then – how, given a user that implements UICollectionViewLayout, do we know where that visible patch is?

That is, if the user doesn't get a chance to layout nodes until the nodes are measured and inserted (since UICollectionViewLayout talks directly to UICollectionView), how can we wait until they are laid out to insert them? And how can we let the user drive the measurement process instead of us measuring batches of nodes and THEN handing them to the user to layout?

One good solution might be to create a new protocol such as `ASCollectionNodeLayout` that resembles `UICollectionViewLayout`. The user provides us this object, and we talk to it, and we provide our own `UICollectionViewLayout` that vends data buffered from their async layout.

This new async layout would break the circular dependency (insertion [depends on] layout [depends on] insertion). That is, the async layout would find out about new items before the UICollectionView does. It would stay in sync with the data source, which would be another huge win for reliability, since layouts often talk directly to delegates (such as `collectionView:layout:sizeForItemAtIndexPath`). This async layout object (which may well have to run on the main thread, we'll see) will be responsible for allocating & measuring nodes only as it needs to (which is a huge win for the photo grid use case). 

It would be easy enough for us to ask this new async layout object for `layoutAttributesForElementsInRect:` given the screen + some buffer in case they're scrolling. We can't do this today, because the elements aren't yet inserted in the collection view.

Thoughts @nguyenhuy?
",Adlai-Holler,nguyenhuy
2541,2016-11-16 18:42:30,"@Adlai-Holler: Yeah, great question on determining visible nodes. I was thinking maybe we can rely on the previous visible paths and assume that the new ones are at least very close. It's definitely the case if items have the same size. I can even put up a short working prototype with that assumption.

That being said, your idea is more generalized and should cover all cases. But it looks like a big change. After a discussion with @garrettmoon, @appleguy and @maicki, we agreed that we don't have time to make it to 2.0. @garrettmoon will move #2536 to later milestones.

@maicki: In the `CustomCollectionView` example, if you rotate to landscape, it will call `-shouldInvalidateLayoutForBoundsChange` and then request the `-constrainedSizeForNode...`. However, when you rotate back to portrait, even though it calls `-shouldInvalidate` and the app replies `YES`, there are no further calls to the `-constrainedSize` method and the layout results in overlapping images.

We are very interested in higher performance implementations for ASVideoNode.  There are some hacky techniques to do this with AVPlayer, but not all of those techniques can be upstreamed, leaving the public version suboptimal for real apps.

What iOS version does your new implementation work on?  What are the less predictable elements — does framerate of playback vary, or any issues with audio support?

I would suggest publishing either a new mode of operation for ASVideoNode that we may enable to be the default later (perhaps even for the 2.0 release), or creating an ASVideoNodeBeta that we could cut over to later (we've done this before with ASRangeController being rewritten).  This would allow us to accept the changes into master as quickly as possible, and get other developers testing and moving it forward, without exposing all users to the initial risk.

So, I'll write down what I think is the _""canonical""_ way of setting up ASDK nodes inside UIViewControllers.

1. Add an `ASDisplayNode` to your `UIView`. Typically, setting it's bounds = view.bounds in the `viewDidLayoutSubviews` method is useful for most cases
2. Add subnodes to the aforementioned `ASDisplayNode`
3. Profit ??

One problem though, where do you place the layout code? (the stuff that's supposed to go in `layoutSpecThatFits` ?

Answer: you add a layoutSpecBlock to the `ASDisplayNode`

If this is the issue, I can adapt this task into a request to clarify the API.  It should probably have a separate variant, like imageDidLoadToProgress:, while the basic version assumes the client is only interested in 100% loaded.  I am pretty sure today it's called on each load of the image, since technically they are relevant moments in the loading process.

I'd suggest updating to master (or releases/p6.13 if you want a more stable target that we've shipped a Pinterest release with).  Please let us know if you see any loading issues with this version.  You should find performance of image loading to be improved as well.

One solution would be to add a weak reference to the owning `ASTableNode/ASCollectionNode` to `ASIndexedNodeContext` (passed into `init`) and to `ASCellNode` (publicly `readonly`, privately `readwrite` in `ASCellNode+Internal.h`).

It has the advantage of being more concrete and understandable to developers; a ""Layoutable"" is a pretty abstract and funny-sounding thing, whereas a ""LayoutElement"" can more readily be understood as an individual object that relates to a layout.

2448,2016-11-01 00:36:33,"@rainypixels I would love to help you out with this!  If you could ping me on Slack, we could work through some debugging steps.

Naturally it's important to dump a ""po [[UIWindow keyWindow] recursiveDescription]"", so if you could send this over (or post it here if it's not sensitive), that would be the best start.

ASDK 2 is now very stable and is better in 1.9.91 in really all respects; we're shipping Pinterest with it, Buffer is using it at scale, and others as well.  So as you mentioned in the core of your message (but not at the end), you should jump on master or one of our branches (like releases/p6.13) and debug from that state.

The most likely suspect is that you have a supernode/superview that is zero-sized or sized smaller than it should be, and one of the children is outside the bounds of that parent (which must have clipsToBounds = NO, if this theory is correct).  In such a case, display will work perfectly, but event delivery won't occur.

If you need to dive in, you can set a breakpoint on hitTest: or pointInside and follow the UIKit event delivery process.  You should be able to do this on _ASDisplayView, which will make the debugging more concrete than if you set a symbolic breakpoint on UIKit itself, and it will cut out some of the extra levels that probably aren't the issue (UIWindow, UIViewController container views, etc).
",appleguy,rainypixels
2448,2016-11-01 22:59:36,"I just found the issue thanks to your `hitTest` symbolic breakpoint tip!

Embarrassingly enough, I actually found a method override with this signature in a `UICollectionViewCell` extension:



I remember adding it a while back to help with some debugging/touch visualization, and I must have checked it in by mistake. The method was effectively swallowing touches in `UICollectionViewCell` instances. This never affected my project until I integrated ASDK a couple of weeks ago, and converted my tableview-based feeds to collectionview nodes. Perfect storm!

Thanks much, @appleguy! I'm going to go ahead and close this issue.
",rainypixels,appleguy
2442,2016-11-01 00:42:44,"@CR34L Indeed, ASCollectionNode is not self-sizing in terms of its own bounds, and you need to either force synchronous layout (not great) or wait for the layout completion block to be called if you want to know the contentSize and use this to set the bounds.

There are some other tasks filed on adding these capabilities to ASCollectionNode, but since the use case is rare, we haven't been able to prioritize them yet.

Typically I suggest finding a way to calculate the one constrained dimension (e.g. in a vertical view with horizontal nested view, you only need the height of the collection, and can usually make the collection bounds as wide as the screen).  You can do this by implementing calculateLayoutThatFits: (or even just calculateSizeThatFits:) on the ASCellNode that contains your collection, and iterate over the cell nodes of the collection to call layoutThatFits: on them.  This can be pretty efficient if done thoughtfully (providing the same constrainedSize to the cell nodes as the collection will later provide to them; returning the same instance to the collection that you create to provide the layout of the cell; etc).

Sorry we don't have a better technique at the moment, would love to eventually!

We are preparing a 2.0 Cocoapod version for first-half December final bits.

However, running on the latest framework is not for everyone, and if 1.9.90 is working and you've run into this error - you can now update to 1.9.91.  It doesn't have any other changes except setting the podspec to a fixed version of PINRemoteImage, which it should have done (but was a one-character mistake in the ASDK .podspec config :( ).

1.9.91 is finished and the branch (same name) is available on Github.  It also looks like it has propagated to Cocoapods now too: https://cocoapods.org/pods/AsyncDisplayKit

- @Adlai-Holler, @garrettmoon for context.  I modified the layout benchmark to be more discrete / reproducible, by changing the array that specifies view counts to be [100, 100, 100].

Running this benchmark on my iPhone 7 / A10, the cost associated with accessing the Style properties _other than .size, which is still locked_ has disappeared.  Accessing the style object itself also is still locked and is the largest single locking cost.

Images below:
1. Before cost (**73ms**) for properties on the style object (run 2 of 2 was the before / without the patch)
2. After cost (**17ms**) for properties on the style object (run 1 of 2)
2. Cost (**64ms**) (same before / after) of accessing the style object itself, through the lock.

@Adlai-Holler I turned off event logging by default even in DEBUG.  For the TableView example, we were exceeding 1GB of memory at peak (even without this change - it's not the queuing).  With those objects disabled, it's closer to 300MB.  I didn't look into it exhaustively, but there's a whole lot of the tracer objects :).

- You don't know you need event logging until you do. If you stumble upon some rare crash/race condition, you can't relaunch the app to turn it on.
- This is a wacky synthetic benchmark that creates and measures as many nodes as possible all at once, so the performance implications of event tracing in this context shouldn't drive our decisions.

I agree we don't need to be too concerned with a synthetic benchmark; however, since running as DEBUG on a device is not too uncommon for Pinterest development, if the memory overhead reaches similar levels for complex UI flows then we should consider making it simulator-only (or reducing the log size some other way)

2398,2016-10-16 19:43:38,"@appleguy Yes! The `position` will be `readonly` public, no problem and internally we can expose properties of `ASLayout` that we need `readwrite` like `position`

I've modified the diff to lock `position` and noted a potential race condition. We could build basically a stochastic thrash unit test that attempts to reproduce the issue I described but the risk is very low.

Adding the internal header could be accomplished in a follow-up diff, as it would involve many code changes unrelated to this very sensitive core change.

The layoutElement weak pointer is still one of the top causes of contention even after this change, but it is in a more reasonable range.  If we can think of a way to avoid using weak - some other data store that even if it behaves similarly, does not have lock contention against other weak variables- it would be worth doing.

Is the latest benchmark on your LayoutKit branch?  As we know, this ops/sec test is not exactly the most important metric for user-percieved performance, but still I'm curious to try out the latest on a tri-core iPad Air 2 and look at the key sources of contention.

2392,2016-10-16 07:08:38,"@Adlai-Holler @maicki Cool, I have some interesting profiling results.  We are spending an astounding amount of time dealing with the weak variable .layoutElement on ASLayout.

We're also triggering creation of the new .style object even when it is not needed / set to all-default values, but this is nowhere near as significant as the weak variable and general object cost of ASLayout.

This is an **inverted** tree showing the cost of weak, primarily layoutElement, on the powerful A8X over a short period of ~2 seconds of intense work.  The figures are pretty astounding!  The folded aggregations that do exceed weak represent the cost of object allocations in general, but unsure how actionable that is.

If we found an alternative data structure to perform the ASLayout -> ASLayoutElement weak mapping, it could pay off hugely, because of the extreme commonality of these objects (during both initial layout calculation and then flattening).  If we could ensure safety of unsafe_unretained (maybe by having the ASLayoutElement clear its own back-pointer on dealloc), that's one fix.  Perhaps only during the initial layout tree creation, before the longer-lived flattened version is created, there may be a guarantee that the ASLayoutElement will live as long as the ASLayout.

It seems likely that we can skip this copy. The old `position` value is probably not important to anyone. And `flattened` is only read on the layout's sublayouts in that same method, so unless we have a circular dependency the flag could probably be removed entirely.

Thoughts?

2392,2016-10-16 19:24:13,"@appleguy @Adlai-Holler Another approach is to finally create a new private (or layoutspec / subclass) header for `ASLayout` that we use internally in ASDK that defines the properties like `flatten` and `position` of the layout as readwrite and allows us to change them without having to make an explicit copy. Furthermore this would allow us to declare the position of the `ASLayout` in the public header finally as `readonly`.

Is there any other advantage besides avoiding the return [ASLayoutSpec layoutSpecWithNode:self] line, and replacing it with return self; ?

I do think that 'size to match parent' easy path is very useful.  If that's the only advantage though, looking at the two names:
- (id<ASLayoutElement>)layoutElementThatFits:
- (ASLayoutSpec *)layoutSpecThatFits:

The layout spec method feels easier to understand.  This isn't just because of the protocol / return value, but because layoutSpec seems to clearly name it is the method to specify layout.  A layoutElement is a bit more vague of a connection - does a layoutElement just exist within a layout, or does it _define_ the layout?

It does appear that the app code is submitting invalid update details to AsyncDisplayKit.  You should also get an internal inconsistency error if you linked it up with UICollectionView.

I think there could be a thread safety issue in the TableViewController in the sample app.  Somehow, the data source (self.results) is ending up with fewer items than the insertions / deletions have reported.  In other words, items are getting removed from .results at some point, without the table being told they were inserted or deleted.

Here's the log of my debug session.  Please do reopen this task or come find us on Slack if you encounter any behavior from ASDK that looks incorrect!  If you could tweak your sample project so a #define swaps in a UICollectionView for the ASCollectionView, that could also help isolate the issue.

2350,2016-10-07 10:19:16,"@hannahmbanana: Simply overriding `viewWillAppear()` and `viewDidAppear()` in the `ChildViewController` from the code above shows that they aren't called too.

I've taken a look at the `ASCellNode` implementation. What it is doing is explicitly calling `[_viewController view];`. The view controller then calls the `loadView()`, `viewDidLoad()` and all other methods.

This does the trick in my code too, but, in my opinion, it looks more like an error-prone workaround rather than a straightforward solution. I'd expect the `ASDisplayNode` to notify its view controller that it has loaded without requiring me to call anything explicitly.

I think the proper solution is to add an implicit relationship between an `ASDisplayNode` and its view controller. What do you think?

2350,2016-11-01 01:35:16,"@EugenePogrebnoy Thanks for the valuable description of the issue - I'd like to make sure this works correctly.

The right moment is almost certainly in -didEnterVisibleState and -didExitVisibleState.  For items in a scrolling container, this is called when at least one pixel of the cell is actually visible; for all other nodes, it's called when the item is added or removed from an active UIWindow sub-tree.

Although it would require a subclass, could you try this and let us know if it works?  If so, we could easily add a visibilityBlock or similar to be called on changes without subclassing.

If you have any issues with this, creating the analogous example for pure UIViewControllers that does work as you expect would be valuable in helping to illustrate the point of breakdown.

I'd be happy to assist in debugging this and ensure the right solution is upstreamed.  Please feel free to join us on Slack and correspond with me in a direct message as well!

2350,2016-11-17 09:40:51,"@EugenePogrebnoy Hi! I believe there are two aspects in play here:

There is the fact that `-[UIViewController view]` actually calls `-loadView` and `-viewDidLoad`, and so if you use `vc.node.view` to retrieve the view, that code will not be run. This is something we should think about how best to handle. We should also keep in mind that technically a user could pass a loaded node into `-initWithNode:`.

Separately, there is the fact that whenever you use child view controllers, it's important to add the view into the parent's view in between the calls to `addChildViewController` and `didMoveToParentViewController:`. So to fix the immediate issue, modifying as follows is a pretty standard convention for view controller containment:

@appleguy, I managed to solve my problem with the following class:



I tried it with both `UIViewController` and `ASViewController` subclasses and everything looks to work the right way.

Loading the view in response to the visibility events seems to work too, but then all loading and layout process happens immediately when the node becomes visible, which may cause some lags. So I thought that it's better to load the view as early as possible, i.e. in the `didLoad`.

Calling `child.didMove(toParentViewController: containerVC)` in the `didEnterVisibleState` seems to work ok too.

Ideally, there should also be some logic to remove the child view controller from its parent when it's not needed anymore. That would be especially useful in the `ASCellNode` subnodes. Probably it should happen in response to interfaceState change events (`ASInterfaceStateMeasureLayout` or `ASInterfaceStateFetchData`). But I'm currently satisfied with the solution above.

It would also be nice to detect the correct container view controller automatically instead of setting it explicitly. But that might require some deep changes in `ASDiplayNode` class.

@Adlai-Holler, I generally agree with you. The only thing is that as I understand `self.view.addSubview(self.child.view)` is supposed to be called by ASDK when using `usesImplicitHierarchyManagement = true`. And while this approach solves the problem in the example, I'm afraid that it can become a nuisance in more complex node hierarchies.

As @Adlai-Holler already mentioned I think we have to have in mind that the node hierarchy is different than the view hierarchy different than the view controller hierarchy. You always have to add the view within `addChildViewController` and `didMoveToParentViewController:`, so in theory `loadView` should be called with the right timing. Setting `automaticSubnodeManagement` to true just means that we manage the subnode hierarchy for you in this case and `addSubnode` does not need to be called too at some point.

The issue that `loadView` is not called for already loaded nodes still exists though.",maicki,Adlai-Holler

""This retain cycle is intentionally created because the node is in a ""live"" view hierarchy (it is inside the a UIWindow that is onscreen).

For the same reason, if the node's view is a descendant of a window, but there is no reference to the node, we keep the node alive with a strong reference from the view. 

Good application design should not rely on this behavior, because a strong reference to the node should be maintained by the subnodes array or by an instance variable. However, this condition occasionally occurs, for example when using a UIView animation API.

As a short term fix, you may be able to avoid this by setting `defaultImage` to be the local video frame whenever you have a local frame available. Use it for the generic thumbnail if that is all you have, or override it with a locally cached image if available. 

There is a known issue with the `.image` property being cleared if it is not the same as represented as the URL (#2275), because ASNetworkImageNode was originally designed for these two to be related. But we should definitely support this use case.

like this :

You can do this loop on a background thread. If the same cell nodes are provided to the collection, then the layout will be cached and not need to recompute. Based on the size of the cell nodes, you can set the `.style.preferredSize` of the inner collection node and call `-setNeedsLayout` on it's parent.

I suppose I might be able to solve it using a table (or collection), but the page isn’t really tabular, so I was trying to just use the most accurate set of components for my goal.  I try to avoid using tables simply for layout reasons for the same reason that it’s recommended to not use tables for layout within websites, even though in a lot of cases that makes it easier to render your view the way you want.

The best way to explain what I am doing (I simply dropped out of ASDK for rendering these screens for the time being) is it’s like viewing a photo album on Facebook, where there’s an image that takes up the vast majority of the screen, with text/etc info below the image.

The two complications are

1. The image resolution is well above what can be shown within the screen, and the user needs to be able to zoom into various portions of the image (this is literally the entire purpose of this screen).
2. The text/etc below the image will in most cases extend below the bottom of the screen, so the user needs to be able to scroll the entire screen down in addition to being able to pan/zoom within the image.

The whole thing is contained within a collection view (of the set of images).  It does full screen swipe left/right between items in the image collection.

So, as you can see, I have like 4 or 5 different pan/scroll/swipe actions all layered on top of each other within the screen.

I already have code to manage the relationship between those.  I got it to faithfully reproduce everything I am doing within the non ASDK-based screen, with the single exception of being able to actually pan/zoom on the image.

All that being said, if the only thing I need to do to make this work is swap out the ASScrollNode for a table, I will do that ASAP.  The code I had to write to emulate some of the under the cover stuff in ASDK is awful and ugly, and I would LOVE to get rid of it and just use ASDK here.

2278,2016-09-24 16:49:45,"Thanks for raising this @george-gw. It's unfortunate – `UIControlState` declares `UIControlStateNormal = 0` but in Swift it gets a `public static var normal: UIControlState { get }`. Having a ""zero"" option like this is [not technically allowed](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithCAPIs.html) but Apple must've made some special exception.

I think we have two choices here:
- Do nothing. In Swift you'll have to use `[]` to represent an ""empty"" control state. Not really acceptable.
- Investigate whether we can add an optional Swift file into ASDK that defines an extension on `UIControlState` that adds the static var. Ideal outcome, extremely costly and perhaps impossible.
- Define `ASControlStateNormal = 1` as you mentioned. Fixes the Swift import, but diverges from UIKit's values and creates a new ""undefined"" 0 state. Also it's conceptually incorrect – normal means 0 flags.
- Replace `ASControlState` with `UIControlState`. Fixes everything, but we lose control of the enum. We could use `#define ASControlState UIControlState` to ease the transition.

We should do the last one. Apple has created a special exception for themselves and we should piggyback on it. The likelihood of us creating some new control state in the future is extremely low. This also eliminates code which is always nice. @appleguy @maicki could someone else weigh in?

I dug into the source code to see what` [ASDisplayNode invalidateCalculatedLayout]` does , and it simply marked the current layout dirty.

I wonder why wrapping `scrollToRoAtIndexPath:` inside an async method **GUARANTEES** that the calculation of the new layout will happen before the scrolling method ,since ASDK do background calculations only when the current runloop is ""waiting"" , what if the current loop is so busy ,that ASDK cannot finish all the calculations between ""before waiting"" and ""after waiting"", and in the next loop, when the scrolling method is called , will the scrolling still behave correctly  ?",Gocy015,EviluS

- The class names are unpleasant. How about replace `ASLayoutableStyleDeclaration` with `ASStyle`? It has the word ass in it, which is unfortunate and kind of funny.
- Our dimension creating is also unpleasant.
  - Ideally we could do something clever with macros to enable: `style.minHeight = ASDimensionMake(100%)`. And somehow get the preprocessor to notice the suffix.
  - We could optimize the string-based creation method (probably using C-strings – currently it's quite expensive) but it's still a little ugly.
  - Now that we have a style object, we could expose: `minHeight: CGFloat, minHeightPercent: CGFloat, minHeightAuto: BOOL` which are all interfaces to the same underlying ASDimensionValue.
- The word `Declaration` in e.g. `ASStackLayoutStyleDeclaration` is baffling to me. If we use `ASStyle` for the main style object, let's keep storing layoutspec-specific style options (like centeringOptions) directly on the layout spec object and remove these intermediate objects.

So in the documentation it says that the cell should grow with it's content, meaning that if it had text that grew a ASTextNode with multiple lines of text, the cell height should resize to accommodate that. I believe the reason why it did not grow by itself was due to the fact that the width of the ASCellNode was not set.

- The lightweight node is created upfront, but as long as you don't touch it's view or layer in `init` (see more about this in [Subclassing Nodes](http://asyncdisplaykit.org/docs/subclassing.html)), then those expensive components won't be created until they are likely to be needed as a part of ASDK's [Intelligent Preloading](http://asyncdisplaykit.org/docs/intelligent-preloading.html) system.
- We recommend that you start with a smaller initial set of nodes and use the [Batch Fetching API](http://asyncdisplaykit.org/docs/batch-fetching-api.html) to load more as the user scrolls.

After that user can scroll in both directions and i want to batch fetch items from top or bottom depending of scroll direction.

The overhead is definitely acceptable, about 0.1% CPU.  We of course get some bigger gains from having more objects deallocate off main (although more traffic going through the dealloc queue, and the extra retain / release operations, is going to create some complex additional lock contention issues for us to optimize later).

2221,2016-09-15 05:25:40,"@ay8s Hi! I continued building collection view reordering support, but unfortunately it's going to take more development and testing than I think belongs in this diff. So I reduced this diff back to just table view reordering and I'll land it.

I left the AHCollectionReordering branch up so we don't lose the knowledge gained. Here's an info dump about what will be required for collection view interactive reordering:
- Collection view doesn't call data source `collectionView:moveItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath` until `-endInteractiveMovement`.
- In `updateInteractiveMovementPosition` collection view calls `-moveItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:` on itself if the pending target index path has changed.
- It's a special kind of move, where the data source counts are required _not_ to change (since the data source shouldn't know about it). So we'll have to fake the `numberOfItemsInSection:` return value during interactive moves, to pretend we _don't_ know about the pending move.
- At the same time, we DO need the data controller to move the node after each move update or else the range controller will make mistakes in assigning interface states to each node.
- We need to update the range controller after each such move. This is easily accomplished by adding `-setNeedsUpdate` after calling `[super moveItem:]` if this is an interactive move.
- Just before `endInteractiveMove` we need to put the node back where it was and reset our fake data source counts, so that when we get the _real_ `collectionView:moveItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:` call, we do the update like normal.
- We'll probably need to add two ivars: `sourceInteractiveMoveIndexPath` and `pendingInteractiveMoveIndexPath`. We can use these to fake our data source item counts after each interactive move update, and to move the dragged node around to follow the cell.
- All of the above would work assuming they don't edit the collection view during interactive movement. I'm not sure how well UICollectionView handles this case, even.

@ay8s Hopefully I or someone on the team can get collection view interactive reordering built soon. If you're interested in working on it, please ping me on the asyncdisplaykit slack channel! We can pick up the discussion at #2117

I hate to throw exceptions at our users, but if the alternative is crashes with internal error messages, it's better.

A compromise would be modifying the common exception messages for this error. Maybe if the node has ASM on, add ""This may be caused by manually adding or removing subnodes with automaticallyManagesSubnodes=YES.""

2207,2016-09-08 21:05:15,"@johnepinterest Thanks! Couple notes:
- Will _ASDisplayView have a synthesized atomic accessor for the ivar, even though the getter is declared in a category of the superclass UIView? Should we use that atomic accessor instead of direct ivar access?
- If we only use the variable once during a given scope, what's the benefit in assigning it to a local variable? E.g. `[_asyncdisplaykit_node setTintColor:tintColor]`
- Would you mind rebasing onto master? Should be a trivial change in the `description` method.

2206,2016-09-07 15:51:26,"@maicki The case that we saw in Pinterest was actually range-managed node =/. A plain old ASDisplayNode node was inserted into the subtree of a collection cell, and a layout transition was manually initiated on that cell node before UIKit ran a layout pass that automeasured the node.

Would it make sense to instead go ahead and measure the node at layout transition start time if it hasn't been measured yet?

2203,2016-09-14 05:49:15,"Hi @mikhailmulyar I'm investigating this for you. I've got a couple quick questions:
- Are any of your nodes set with `shouldRasterizeDescendants=YES`? Any of them `layerBacked=YES`?
- How are your section headers working? Are you implementing `viewForHeaderInSection` and returning `cellNode.view`?
- Which node is hitting the assertion failure? A node for a row, a node for a section, or one of the subnodes?

I know those assertion failures can be extremely irritating so I'll do my best to get this fixed the right way!
",Adlai-Holler,mikhailmulyar
2203,2016-09-14 07:37:58,"Hi @Adlai-Holler. 
1) I've used shouldRasterizeDescendants in ASCellNode. However when i received bug, i'm pretty sure i've tried to turn it off, and it did not change anything
2) Yes. I'm returning cellNode.view and storing them in array. However it does not matter, since i've completely commented viewForHeaderInSection and only returned height in heightForHeaderInSection. The screenshot is made in that state, as you can see headers are empty, there is nothing at all.
3) Custom subclass of ASCellNode for row.

2203,2016-11-18 21:24:45,"Hi @Adlai-Holler. At the moment this issue is not happens with exactly same style. But i have not tested it with exactly same nodes and headers count. I have now a bit different count of elements in sections.
However it still happens in another case. So i have pretty same screen with same height of elements, but with different amount of elements in section. I have 14 elements in total, and 2 last of them out of screen(not visible). Element 13 is like 15-20 pixels away from edge of the screen. When i enter text in search bar, it displays found elements and currently simply does reloadData() when data source updated. So here are the steps to reproduce after table initially loaded
1) Input anything in search for table to reload.
2) Delete search text, so table will reload again and show all elements
3) Input text again, after table reloads again all nodes deallocs and assertion happens for node 13.

If before step 3) ill scroll down to make element visible and then scroll back up, and search, assertion does not happen. Node correctly marked was invisible.
So it seems at reload some of close to edge, but not visible nodes somehow marked as visible, but do not marked back as invisible after that

2197,2016-09-06 03:30:43,"@Adlai-Holler The numbers here are impressive.  I have certainly seen the benefit of Copy first-hand, although I am interested in details of how you measured.  Does your measurement exclude the image decoding itself somehow?  Decoding is certainly more costly than the blend operation, so unless this were excluded (maybe by unintentional decoding at an earlier stage or something else), I'm not sure we could see such a large gain.

The other question is the scenario of scrolling to test this.  To remove extra variables you should force-disable rendering progressive images because this could add a lot of extra drawing time in a sporadic way.

2197,2016-09-06 03:53:01,"@Adlai-Holler yay, thank you!  We'll need to take some more accurate measurements — I'm pretty confident the gain is closer to ~10% than ~50% — but it can be guaranteed that there is a meaningful gain here and we should take this patch.

Looking into the image alpha is definitely important because a real alpha channel would increase memory consumption.  I believe the Apple frameworks default to doing this, so we probably need to set up the logic to explicitly specify opaque for JPEG images.

Looking toward the future, I think creating an object for each section even if they don't provide us with a context is valuable. I have some pretty ambitious plans for collection view debugging tools, and reifying the section abstraction (with an auto-incrementing ID) will help move us toward that.

These section objects do not need to hold any nodes or anything – I agree with you that those other two approaches got too messy too fast. Just an ID and optionally a context. Thoughts?

... or another approach (and more advanced) but that I would have to try it out first is to create the inset spec for the text node and wrap the inset spec together with the content node in a static spec, something like that:

That may save us some time during the state transitions, but it does have the drawback of accumulating AVPlayerLayer instances if the user scrolls through a feed of videos, watching each one and letting it reset. The developer may not be aware that the AVPlayerLayers are sticking around. 

I believe that AVPlayer itself, not the player layer, manages the resources for the video so it would be unlikely to cause more network traffic either way we go.

I advocate for showing/hiding the player layer rather than removing/recreating it but I'd like @appleguy @maxsz or @binl to weigh in as they have more expertise around AVFoundation.

We've got a ton of work for ASDK 2 that we're aiming to make ready for release, but here's the info I gathered on a deep-dive into getting collection view reordering working with ASDK (work is on the AHCollectionReordering branch):
- In `updateInteractiveMovementPosition` collection view calls `-moveItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:` on itself if the pending target index path has changed.
- It's a special kind of move, where the data source counts are required _not_ to change (since the data source shouldn't know about it). So we'll have to fake the `numberOfItemsInSection:` return value during interactive moves, to pretend we _don't_ know about the pending move.
- At the same time, we DO need the data controller to move the node after each move update or else the range controller will make mistakes in assigning interface states to each node.
- We need to update the range controller after each such move. This is easily accomplished by adding `-setNeedsUpdate` after calling `[super moveItem:]` if this is an interactive move.
- Just before `endInteractiveMove` we need to put the node back where it was and reset our fake data source counts, so that when we get the _real_ `collectionView:moveItemAtIndexPath:toIndexPath:` call, we do the update like normal.
- We'll probably need to add two ivars: `sourceInteractiveMoveIndexPath` and `pendingInteractiveMoveIndexPath`. We can use these to fake our data source item counts after each interactive move update, and to move the dragged node around to follow the cell.
- All of the above would work assuming they don't edit the collection view during interactive movement. I'm not sure how well UICollectionView handles this case, even.

2110,2016-09-02 13:11:49,"@maicki I'm a huge fan of this direction and strongly believe this is the solution to a lot of the confusion of working with simple layout primitives in AsyncDisplayKit. If you're wondering why I haven't left many comments, it's because I'm a huge fan of its overall functionality and approve its implementation on an architectural level. I'll give it another run through on a more granular scale and see if I can provide independent comments.

The box model is a great guide in helping us carve out an opinion on constructing layout. I can see us easily adopting more elements of the model and introduce them at the ASLayoutable level. A background property, for instance, would be a really interesting evolution to hide background specs. Adding a padding property could do the same for insets.

Moreover, there's a huge potential of us allowing developer to extend ASDimension and provide their own unit types that are computed at run time. Imagine Pinterest being able to define a `columnSpan` unit that is away of the grid system it's currently within and computes the correct values without the need of extra layout specs. If we added inset support, boints would also be a great candidate for a custom unit type, aware of its context and computed in the measure pass.

After reading through this and your documentation, one clear need comes to mind. **It's time to rename ASLayoutable**. For such a core foundational component of the layout system, we should acknowledge it with the credit it deserves and give it a descriptive name that is clear about its function. I suggested `ASLayoutProducer` in the past, but there are definitely others given this new distinction of “replaced” layoutables.

The documentation you provided to accompany the changes is invaluable. Reading that first helped me to understand the goals and principles of the new changes and I can honestly say I understood it very well. Per my previous comment, I'd love to give you more feedback on that directly. Put it up in a separate PR and we can do a round of changes to be published on the site. I'll provide a little bit of feedback here for now.

For now, we should not compare directly to the CSS box model, as the current implementation only realistically supports the concept of a ""content area"". It will confuse developers if we provide them with an incorrect mental model and have to do the work of correcting it while they're learning. The first section of the documentation spends a significant amount of time clarifying the definition of what parts of the box model the layout system does not support. It's better to save our breath and describe the layout system from first-principles, not so much by analogy.

When we're introducing the layout behavior, we can very much say that it's inspired by the box model, but never directly compare ourselves to it. My concern is that we give developers the wrong impression of the layout engine behaving one-to-one with box model and supporting concepts like page flow, dynamic sizing and might assume about containing block behavior.

I love that you have provided distinction for replaced layoutables. Let’s come up with a simple name that defines their behavior. Thinking more abstractly about this actually might help in coming up with a new name for layoutables in general.

2105,2016-10-11 03:32:23,"@yxztj great info, thanks!  The results above — were they tested with master, or 1.9.90?  Master does have some changes in this area.

The initial height calculation — is the value for the hight coming from TextKit?  I'm thinking it should return the necessary height to draw...if it is not, then this is a TextKit bug.  It is something we may should be able to work around, but this is a bit tricky, because the line spacing property could change in different ranges in the attributed string...and Apple may fix the sizing bug in a future iOS version.

If it's not a TextKit bug and is only an ASDK bug, that's certainly great news!

Relatedly, we currently have an ASTextKitRenderer caching mechanism in-place, but disabled.  It's intended that the second pass here not be necessary, and that would seemingly fix the issue too.  However we should make sure the result is consistently the same even if caching were to fix it, since a cache shouldn't be required for correctness.

Thanks again, looking forward to fixing this.  We made some key breakthroughs adopting the new layout API version in Pinterest today, and will be intensely focused on it this week, but the test case and debugging you provided will make it much more practical for me to try and fix it this weekend
",appleguy,yxztj
2105,2016-10-11 07:15:41,"@appleguy Thanks for the reply. Now I found some more information. All test is based on latest master branch.
1. In ASTextNode calculateSizeThatFits, textRenderer is required to calculate its size. At this time constrainedSize height is infinite. 
2. After size is calculated(using [layoutManager usedRectForTextContainer]), in ASTextNode calculatedLayoutDidChange, it sets the result as new constrainedSize for renderer. Since the size is changed, textRenderer discard its context and reset all variables.
3. In ASTextNode drawRect, the renderer needs to re-calculate its size based on new constrainedSize, which is only enough for a total of 3 lines(2 lineSpacing count, so I cannot say it is a wrong size), but not good for clipping 10 lines to 3 with lineSpacing > 0, as the 3rd lineSpacing is also needed for TextKit to render the 3rd line(not documented, maybe it's an Apple bug, maybe it's by design).

For ASDK, setting constrainedSize on the renderer leads to discarding its current context(with correct truncation result), triggering another size calculation during drawRect. Due to short in height, truncation result is different than first pass.

Is it necessary to reset textRender's context on calculatedLayoutDidChange? Anyway its expensive for the text size to be calculate twice(in both layout and drawRect, even if with no truncation), as we already have the correct size for truncated text. 
If there needs to be 2 passes of size calculation, then we might need to figure out how to give enough space for TextKit to calculate the correct character range in truncation in 2nd pass.

I had an issue in one of my app with ASDelegateProxy. I had some code that was testing the class of a UIScrollView delegate with `isKindOf:` and that will crash on an NSProxy object (because NSProxy doesn't implement isKindOf).
I ended up using `isProxy` to avoid the crash.

Back to the original question, if ASDelegateProxy doesn't actually use the NSProxy APIs, do we have a substantial added benefit of having it an NSProxy instead of an NSObject ?

Note: I'm not very familiar with NSProxy, so there is potentially one (or several) very valid reason to use it.

Section Info sounds like a pretty good name.  SectionLayoutInfo might make it more clear?

This type of extension object is guaranteed to not be required for regular cell / items in the data source, right, because an ASCellNode class could have properties for them?  Or should we consider something like that now, if it will be needed to be able to specify IDs or something else to enable diffing or virtualization features?

So we ought to go whole hog and subtly encourage users to treat this object as the general ""node"" that represents the section.

2063,2016-08-14 18:49:12,"@modLX4: the most common pattern for this in Obj-c is to have a delegate protocol. For example you could have an interaction delegate on a subclass of a buttonNode. The alternative if you have many buttons is to addTarget: from the view controller itself (the view controller needs to be able to reach in and access the reference for the button to do this). A common case would be a subnode that contains many buttons. The subnode would set itself as the target for each button and then have a single delegate as the view controller.

ASDisplayNodes (ASButton node is a subclass) do not have tags, because it is not considered a good programming practice to use tags. However, if you absolutely need a tag, you could set the node's view's tag in `-didLoad` by calling `node.view.tag`.

2055,2016-08-11 06:48:19,"@robmontesinos: Not sure where my previous comment went. :) 

The issue is that the ASViewController's _root_ node inherits the bounds of the view controller. If you want to change the frame of the `ASTableNode`, you could supply a dummy `ASDisplayNode` to the ASViewController: `initWithNode:[[ASDisplayNode alloc] init]` and then add the `ASTableNode` as a subnode. I am not sure if this is the best way for what you are doing or for the framework, but it is one way of doing it. 

Is this banner a node that uses layout specs? If so, in `viewWillLayoutSubviews` make sure to call `[addBannerNode measureWithSizeRange:]` and provide a size range with height and width (using size of the view - `node.bounds`) that you would like. This measure call is currently necessary to ensure that layout specs are run even though the add banner itself is not inside of a layout spec, this will be fixed in the next release (but the call will always be safe to do.

- Type ""CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION"" in search

Here are a few things that I noticed in your code:
- I don't think you are supposed to set `.parent` on an inset spec (or any layout spec). 
- for a static spec to work correctly, you should set `.sizeRange` and (optionally) `.position` on its children (`superSpec` and `insetSpec` in your example). 

Also, could you send me this sample? It might be easier to help if I can run the code? :)

Just to test, I tried adding very long strings to other ASTextNodes in this context: same result. 
Also tried simply putting a single ASTextNode and removing all extraneous nodes but the result is the same.
I have the feeling for some strange reason, the ASTextNodes are ignoring the constrained size… but still getting placed in the right X and Y positions, and that it is all related to the general structure (ASCollectionNode, containing ASTableNodes).

What happens is the last state you get when you start playing the video is 'ready to play' rather than 'playing'. I translate from one to the other so that the following case statement in my code works fine.

Yes, if I start tweaking the states, we might as well try to solve other problems. I'll take a look at different use cases. Any feedback / sample projects are welcome. :-)

2024,2016-08-03 08:00:18,"@gazreese Yes, I was easily able to reproduce the behaviour you describe. Removing these unwanted state changes wasn't that hard. I also noticed that the same thing happens when the video finishes: `PlaybackLikelyToKeepUpButNotPlaying` can be set after the `Finished` state. This could be the intended behaviour but I'm not sure.

Also, most of the state changes happen through KVO. The state changes in `play` and `pause` seem a bit out of place. Maybe observing `rate` on the `AVPlayer` would provide a more accurate indication of whether the video is playing. I remember doing this a while back on another project.

2024,2016-08-03 08:45:03,"@gazreese Yes, I have more or less the same code. I make the same check for the `PlaybackLikelyToKeepUp` notification, such that the state stays `Playing` when it needs to.

I experimented with what I was suggesting: using KVO on `rate` instead of changing the state in `play` and `pause`. It works great, the only noticeable change is that when the video finishes, the `rate` change is notified before `didPlayToEnd`. This results in `Playing -> Paused -> Finished` instead of just `Playing -> Finished`. Would that be a problem?

So far it works on a sample project provided by @maxsz, and on my project (although I don't make heavy use of the states). As mentioned in my very first post, in addition to fixing the states, it also prevents the `ASVideoNode` from unnecessarily reloading the `playerItem`, hence removing some flickering and ""play-back-from-start"" issues I was having.

@johnepinterest is investigating in this area.  

 Updating the framework would be good. Do you happen to use the name _propertyLock for any of your instance variables? We address this in the latest version, but if you are shadowing this variable, it could cause an issue like this in the last version.  (1.9.80, fixed as one of a number of improvements in 1.9.81)

Pinterest is currently shipping off of the branch called 1.9.90.  If you are willing to point to a branch in your Podfile, this is considered stable and is the best version at the moment.  We will push a pod in a week or two.  1.9.81 is an ok choice as well, but .90 has both performance and some stability improvements.

I am having a bit of trouble understanding your question. (1) Your node may be being initialized on a background thread, so it is important to keep `-init` thread safe - no creation / accessing of UIViews or CALayers. (2) You may set properties on the view in didLoad (called on the main thread), and you should (3) do main thread layout in `-layout`

Here are some notes on `ASDisplayNode` subclass override methods:

| subclass method | notes |
| --- | --- |
| `-init` | Node initialization occurs on **background thread**.   This has only one key requirement for the developer: never create or touch any `UIKit` objects in `-init`.  This includes the node's own `.view` / `.layer`.  **Do not access these** (e.g. `self.view.hidden` or `addGestureRecognizer:`)  Instead, use the node properties if available (e.g. `self.hidden`), or do these things in `-didLoad`. |
| `-didLoad` (a.k.a. the node's `.view` ""did load"") | This method is conceptually similar to UIViewController's `-viewDidLoad` method and is the point where the node's view has been loaded.  It's the first chance to **safely access the node's view or layer**.  It is guaranteed to be called on the **main thread** and is the correct place to do any direct `UIKit` setup. |
| `-layoutSpecThatFits:` | This method defines the layout and does the heavy calculation on a **background thread**. The layout spec object has the important responsibility of calculating the size and position of all subnodes, and also the overall size of the node.  Because it is run on a background thread, you should not set any `UIView` or `CALayer` properties directly, but you can use the node equivalent properties.  Also, do not add or remove subnodes in this method. |
| `-layout` | This method is always called on the **main thread**, and should always begin with `[super layout]`.  It is called in the same way as `-[UIView layoutSubviews]`.  This is a good spot to set view-based properties that change based on your node state, like `hidden` or `backgroundColor`.  Less than 1 in 10 subclasses will need this. |

You can set an absolute `layoutPosition` and a `sizeRange` for all of it's children. So I would create a new node e.g. `AvatarNode` with avatar image and plus sign as subnodes and in `layoutSpecThatFits:` put the avatar image and the plus sign in a static layout spec and lay them out absolute. Than put the `AvatarNode` in a vertical stack spec with the other nodes (e.g. the ""Sign Up"" button).

Hope that's a good starting point ...

2001,2016-07-28 23:49:37,"@raphaels17: `-layoutSpecThatFits:` is used to specify the layout of a node's _subnodes_. The parent's layout is set by one of the following:
- the grandparent's node's `-layoutSpecThatFits:` method
- If the node is the root node of an ASViewController (e.g. a collectionNode that is passed to the initializer with `-initWithNode:_collectionNode`) then the collectionNode will inherit the bounds of the ASViewController
- if you use a UIViewController you will need to specify the bounds manually e.g. in `viewWillLayoutSubviews`

One more tip: `.sizeRange` will not apply to children of a `ASStackLayoutSpec` (only those of an `ASStaticLayoutSpec`):

`UICollectionView` waits to load its initial data until `layoutSubviews`, while `UITableView` does not. If you want to force your collection view to load its data while it's offscreen, modify your `Extension.swift:preloadView` method like so:

1958,2016-07-21 11:08:55,"@KRUBERLICK Hey I would have a couple of question:
- Which version of ASDK are you on?
- Did you try master?
- Do you use Implicit Hierarchy Management in one of the nodes?
- Could you please post the full stacktracek (`bt all`) if the crash occurs?
- Is it reproducible in a short example app?

Thank you very much!

E.g. they are not actually removed from the count until iterated.  There are comments talking about this in the original implementation I believe.

We shouldn't land this without some further discussion on that, and verifying the details of the important systems impacted by this.

Also, this is an API change.  I believe we are using ASWeakSet in Pinterest, and I have suggested it for use to a few community members.

Honestly I'd prefer we keep ASWeakSet even if you want to swap out the implementation, because in comparison, the NSHashTable / NSMapTable classes and their initializers are obscure.  We shouldn't add our own primitive for everything, but particularly given the count pitfall, I think it is worth at least a tiny wrapper class.

In terms of naming for our internal methods we tend to go to one underline in the method name like `_clearFetchedData`. Curious what @appleguy or @Adlai-Holler thinks about it.
",maicki,eanagel
1952,2016-07-22 16:34:01,"@maicki so I looked a the test and I think the problem is the test ;) It looks like we are doing the following with `ASVideoNode`:
1. set invalid asset
2. set placeholder image
3. test A: videoNode.image == placeholder
4. set second invalid asset
5. test B: videoNode.image != placeholder

Test B now fails. It was succeeding previously because we used to clear the image briefly when setting an asset. Note that if we had swapped steps 1 and 2 the old code (pre this PR) would have failed ;)

Given that the image always displays the placeholder and shouldn't be effected by setting the asset (and especially an invalid one), the existing test doesn't make much sense. I went ahead and replaced it with a similar test that ensures that the image is not changed (cleared) when setting an asset, which is what I'm fixing.

- Could you be more specific on what you do when the gesture recognizer updates? Which layout attributes do you change and how?

- _Do the cells still switch position but no longer animate, or do they just stay where they are until something else happens?_

When I use `performBatchUpdates:completion:` nothing happens,  they stay at their positions. When I use `invalidateLayout` they switch positions but no animation.
- _ Are you using flow layout or a custom layout?_

I use layout that inherits from UICollectionViewFlowLayout and introduces some changes that make cells swap.
- _Could you be more specific on what you do when the gesture recognizer updates? Which layout attributes do you change and how?_

It updates indexPath, hidden attribute and center of cells. This would be hard to describe it all. I will send you project example.
- _Have you tried reverting c62a4d3 ? Does that fix the issue?_

Yes, every commit before this one works fine.
- _Could you try calling invalidateLayout and then [UIView animateWithDuration:^{ [collectionView layoutIfNeeded]; }]?_

When I use this code, animation is different and performance is poor. Cell disappear in one place and shows at another, but what I need it to do is slide from one place to another.
-  _Could you make a sample project that reproduces this?_

Yes, I think that would be the best idea. Please see attachment, especially:

Separately (but probably not the cause of the crash), it looks like you are using UIKit's Auto Layout. Just so you know, AsyncDisplayKit is not intended to support that. 

http://asyncdisplaykit.org/docs/faq.html#asyncdisplaykit-does-not-support-uikit-auto-layout-or-interfacebuilder

ASLayoutSpecs are intended to be an efficient and flexible replacement for UIKit's auto layout, so it should not be necessary to write manual layout code with AsyncDisplayKit.

1934,2016-07-17 19:06:22,"@hannahmbanana: Okay, now I know what happens.
I have a ASTableNode, before getting data from server, I display 10 placeholder rows from a class (let's call it PlaceholderNode). After getting data from server, I reload ASTableNode and everything is fine now except one thing. The 10 instances of PlaceholderNodeCell are not deallocated. They are only deallocated when I reload ASTableNode the second time. So after the second reload, crash will never happen.

In order to make a crash, I have to first select a different tabbarItem in UITabbarController, and then come back, scroll the tableView, this time deinit from PlaceholderNodeCell will be called and make the crash. Any idea why it is happening?
",tungvoduc,hannahmbanana
1934,2016-07-20 19:26:38,"@tungvoduc OK I've found the issue and I've got a fix for you.

When you set FBShimmeringView's `contentView`, the shimmering view replaces the content view's current superview. AsyncDisplayKit notices this, and detaches the content node from its supernode. Since the FBShimmeringView doesn't have a node, from that point on, the content node is outside of AsyncDisplayKit's node hierarchy, so it stops getting visibility/interface state updates – the node gets frozen in its last known interface state. So if the node was visible when it got removed from the hierarchy, then when it deallocates it goes ""how could I be deallocated while I'm visible?!""

The fix I recommend here is to wrap FBShimmeringView in a display node. Here's a modified version of your sample project that does it: [ASDisplayNodeCrash-ah-7-20.zip](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/files/374498/ASDisplayNodeCrash-ah-7-20.zip)

A new class `ShimmeringNode` wraps around `FBShimmeringView` so that the interface state information is always carried down through to the node that got shimmered. Let me know what you think!

If you provide us with some more code (feel free to post a sample project here or email your code to AsyncDisplayKit@gmail.com) we can try to help out. It's possible that you have inadvertently created a retain cycle.

Also, FYI, in the future you can just do `collectionNode.delegate = self`.

Indeed we normally use the role switcher, but if it is necessary to add it to the Copy Headers build phase in addition, we can definitely do that.  As long as we have a CI build test that fails when someone does not do this, I am totally comfortable enforcing that.  The static library / manual integration path is personally important to me that we support, and I'm pretty sad to hear that it was broken, thus my enthusiasm that you both reported this and submitted a fix!

We have a lot of PRs in flight right now, but I can assure you we'll take the fix as soon as a core ASDK team member has a chance to understand everything.  E.g. should be as easy as trying out our own test project and attempting to include a header there, to make sure that failed previously, and now works.

- I do think a recursive .h copy would be better, if you know of a quick way to write this script (it seems like the toughest part is knowing the right $VARIABLES to use, just a bit of research required).  This is not mandatory, but as files are slowly added, we'll probably forget to add some of them to copy headers.
- What were the reasons to change the other #import statements?  Just want to understand why this was necessary so that future additions don't introduce issues, because there are some stylistic changes (e.g. using """" instead of <> in .m - I realize this is more formally correct, but I'm curious if there was a build failure caused on your end by <> because I'd assume those files will only be referenced while the static library itself is being compiled, at which point I think the compiler would resolve them correctly anyway.

To note is that the text node will always truncate where the `\n` is placed in the string. So if you have a string that is: `Test \n 123` it will be truncated as `Test...`.

Do you call `measure:` on the text node in `func calculateSizeThatFits(constrainedSize: CGSize)`?

1841,2016-07-04 04:53:18,"@nickvelloff Great report!  Would you be able to modify one of our examples, or make a new one, that generates this behavior?  It might be as simple as calling measure: at one size, having that display, and after a timer (or a tap) having it measure at another size.  You may be able to use the Kittens app by setting the cells to a fixed height and changing the text, as tapping the cells makes the image take up more of the cell.

I can see why this would happen for items outside of any preload ranges - but it certainly shouldn't happen at all, and indeed is probably a missing invalidateCalculatedLayout somewhere.  Should not be that hard to fix.

What framework version?  We have some changes to ASTextNode in master, although I don't think they will fix this.

1841,2016-07-04 08:14:39,"@appleguy I did everything I could to boil this down to something easily reproducible. Alas, it took a lot more to build the environment necessary than I had hoped. 

The issue is there are currently a lot of customizations required to get ASCollectionNode/View to transition from one layout to another (animated). Once a constrained size is received for a node, it _never asks again_. That is unless I do all the things I do to force it to transition, hence all the custom code you'll see.

My new approach to test and learn is taking advantage of Playgrounds. So I went ahead and did the example that way, in hopes of it being easier to debug. Curious as to your thoughts on it.

1841,2016-07-04 10:05:46,"@appleguy Also you asked if this is a regression. Unfortunately I can't say, because I noticed it in a completely new app design approach, which is full stack ASDK using `ASLayoutSpec`. 
I can say however that using ASTextNode in a far less efficient manner as part of the UIKit view hierarchy did not exhibit this behavior. But that's not super useful as a comparison.

1839,2016-07-04 17:16:21,"@Adlai-Holler Theoretically this can happen, in fact this can already happen with the current implementation too. So in this nothing will change.

I don't believe this is necessary – decoration views are very intentionally walled off from the data source i.e. the presence or absence of decoration views is only determined by the layout based on what items the collection view reports exist.  There's no point at which the user's layout object (the only object that involved with decoration views) would need to interpret an index path from the collection view against the data source in an unsafe way.  It would be safe if the layout simply registers nibs/classes for decoration views and returns layout attributes for them in layoutAttributesForElementsInRect:.

There's not a method like `collectionView:viewForDecorationElementOfKind:atIndexPath:`. Nobody, not even the layout, is intended to bind decoration views to the data source.

- Does ""Clean Build Folder"" (Alt+Shift+Cmd+K) in Xcode fix the issue?
- Would you try this reduced case and see if it works?

Does this handle cases where the network node loads fully, but then its URL is set to nil, and it needs to revert to the defaultImage?  There are many such paths...
",appleguy,tomizimobile
1822,2016-07-11 20:36:06,"@appleguy A walkthrough: as mentioned in the original issue, the layer's `contentsGravity` is set to resize if an image is stretchable, and at no other point is it set to the desired `contentMode`. This code checks if the `defaultImage` is stretchable when set, and if so, will track changes in the `contentMode`. The `_pendingContentModeState` is also set at that time to the current `contentMode` in case it was set before `defaultImage` was. Then, in `-setImage:`, if the image isn't the defaultImage, it'll set the `contentMode` to the pending state first. My flag `_needsToApplyPendingContentMode` ensures the comparison of the image to the `defaultImage` and setting `contentMode` are only done when necessary.

I hadn't considered any case where the image is set to the `defaultImage` after the node loads. I'm pretty sure I'll need to make some changes - I'll take a closer look at it and add some comments in the source when I have a chance.

These features are fairly advanced, in the sense that most users will not need them. I think it is a good idea to support them, but we might want to look at any small ways that we can help stratify the API of these classes to help ensure that new readers are not overwhelmed by the length of the file. This could be as simple as grouping more advanced features in part of the header file, using a category, or perhaps we don't need to worry about this for right now.

Yes I agree, these properties won't be used by most users, and they shouldn't confuse someone who just wants to play a simple video. Good thing is, the default behaviour of the `ASVideoNode` stays the same if you simply ignore these properties.
As these properties are present in `AVPlayerItem`, I think simply moving them down the header file should be enough, as someone who explored the extended capabilities of the `AVPlayerItem` (i.e. scrolled down the header file haha) should have come across them anyway. However I don't have any strong opinion on the subject, so whatever you think is best is totally fine by me.

In combination with the important patch you provided for us previously, these fixes are a reason to consider a new release - supplementary nodes had been hanging by a thread.  I'm relieved that the team is planning to refactor this area and use it to add support for table header / footer nodes too, as well as setting interface states, but this work could take a while.

There is a fairly trivial syntax warning that is blocking the tests:

❌  /Users/travis/build/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/AsyncDisplayKit/Details/ASCollectionDataController.mm:202:56: incompatible pointer types initializing 'NSMutableArray<ASIndexedNodeContext *> *__strong' with an expression of type 'NSArray<ASIndexedNodeContext *> \* _Nullable' [-Werror,-Wincompatible-pointer-types]

There is a lot of good information in the linked issues, and @Adlai-Holler will follow up here.  He has implemented new, high-quality thrash testers for ASCollectionView and is adding supplementary node support to them.  The tester is capable of recording a randomized series of edit transactions for later reproduction of issues, once it uncovers crashes.

Please let us know if you hit any further issues.  One thing I did notice reading the code is that there is no -prepareForDeleteSections: method; I'm not sure if this is required, but it should come up during the audit if so.

Easy way to make is crash to to put these lines into the view controller implementation file:
`
-(void)collectionView:(UICollectionView *)collectionView didSelectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {
  [[_sections objectAtIndex:indexPath.section] removeObjectAtIndex:indexPath.row];
  [_collectionView deleteItemsAtIndexPaths:[NSArray arrayWithObjects:indexPath, nil]];
}

If this behavior is reverted (#1772), we'd be trading crashes in some scenarios for crashes in other scenarios. Perhaps there is a logical error in the recalculation code I wrote? I'll attempt to clone down the example project and see if I can find out anything.

Apologies for introducing a regression!

1771,2016-06-18 22:42:55,"Hey Eric - thanks for your note!  Since the patch is fairly large, I doubt we will actually push a revert, but it is concerning that this scenario (easy to reproduce) is indeed an item-level mutation that did not crash previously.

I think this does highlight that the Supplementary node implementation has some issues that the normal cell / data controller code paths do not, and really does need an overhaul.  I’m hoping we can find a surgical fix, or at least a specific cause, of what behavior in the new code results in this issue so that the author of the fix on our team has enough context to pursue.

1771,2016-06-18 23:09:04,"@appleguy After digging into it, it looks like this is because `UICollectionView` supplementary views can be displayed even if there is not an item at their index path. Flow layout headers are a good example: even if you delete the cell at index 0, the header supplementary view at index 0 remains visible. As such, I believe that we can fix this issue by defensively re-populating the supplementary nodes if the deleted index paths contains the 0 index. I'll go ahead and create a pull request with this fix.

Definitely agree on the supplementary node implementation having some issues on the whole as well. Hopefully a new implementation can solve some issues!

1769,2016-06-18 22:45:15,"I had discussed this with Hannah.  I suggested the Data Source because it is unclear to me if we will land the other PR.  If we do, unfortunately we will need to introduce code that detects the method existing on the data source.  Otherwise it is a very problematic “silent” error that could cause a lot of grief for app developers who update to 2.0, but don’t happen to test a deep corner of their app that uses this method.  I’ve seen in the community it is quite common to not set the .delegate, whether or not this is advisable (it is supported by Apple).

There is also a close parallelism between the nodeFor: and constrainedSizeFor: methods, but ultimately we need to make a decision on the other PR’s course to landing safely before deciding if this should also be in the delegate.

1769,2016-06-19 03:01:37,"@appleguy the other diff was updated to introduce the data source detection note. If you're concerned about a breaking change, we can come up with a plan to assert or warn of the deprecation in an upcoming 2.0 beta and introduce a porting guide to 2.0 when we finalize the release.

The benifit I see here of having these methods on the delegate is that they're are optional and geometry-defining. A quick glance at UITableViewDataSource and UICollectionViewDataSource will show that there is a strict set of responsibilities for the data source that break down to defining count, data, and responding to insertion/deletion events. The delegate protocols, on the other hand have a slew of geometry-based methods, defining size, insets — much like our sizeForNode methods. I think there is some benifit here keeping the data source light and moving optional methods like this to the delegate. It will keep the data source simple and clear on what needs to be defined to support a functional list of nodes.
",levi,appleguy
1769,2016-06-19 13:29:51,"@appleguy I agree with @levi here. I would suggest moving this method to the delegate to be aligned with `UITableViewDataSource` as well as to have the responsibility on the right place: A DataSource and Delegate have specific responsibilities and the responsibilities for sizing lays in the delegate.

I also think we should move the same method slowly to `ASCollectionViewDelegate` as the other diff does with 2.0. Like @levi said via a slow deprecation and a porting guide.

I will be a bit confusing before 2.0 to have the same method on different protocols between table and collection view, but it is getting even more confusing by introducing this method in the data source and deprecate it slowly after.

One way to avoid the issues above may be to make the construction of the ASVideoNode class more explicit like so:

1738,2016-06-12 23:13:02,"@gazialankus you're right, caching is not currently available.  For _most_ apps, this is definitely the correct behavior.  For example, on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, or even most YouTube sessions - it's unlikely enough for a user to come back to watch a previous video that it is likely a waste of space.  However, caching one video up to a maximum of ~50MB, maybe 500MB for a very video-heavy app, could make sense if the user wants to come back and resume a current video.

Because of this highly app-dependent need, I'm not sure that video caching will be implemented by the core ASDK team in the near future.  We are definitely interested to ensure that it is possible for a developer to do this, though.  @Eke or @lappp9 might have some thoughts on the right API override points to make this possible.  Ironically, since it now descends from ASNetworkImageNode, we might be able to plug into the downloader API (or use it for inspiration) to create a Video downloader / data source API.

1736,2016-06-12 23:08:55,"@borut-t one benefit is that you can include it in an ASLayoutSpec tree, allowing other elements in the layout to react to the map's presence.

If there is literally no need for the map other than in the interactive state, the performance benefits are limited.  However, if for example it is in a scrolling view and the user can tap the map to take it fullscreen (a very common case), there are tremendous performance benefits - not just from the snapshotter, but automatic management of preloading the map, memory cleanup, transitioning to and from the live map, etc.

If your only use case is to go directly from a screen that has no map, to a screen that has an interactive map, and the map is not in a scrollable area, then there's no big win.  There isn't a measurable overhead either though, so from an API consistency perspective it can fit in nicely with other ASDK code.

1731,2016-06-09 05:28:36,"@boreys: Great question! There are two issues at play here: (1) the limits of ASDK's gif support and (2) the fact that a size is required to layout all ASDK image nodes. 

I believe that ASNeworkImageNode's gif support was not designed to support a large number of gifs. Depending on the size of the gifs (resolution, length), it could take a significant amount of memory and disk space to decode them, especially with many in a scrolling view. @garrettmoon: could you provide some insight on the limits of gif support?

If your goal is to show small (~20x20) gifs embedded in the text of the comments, I believe I have seen this done using a node as an attachment to the attributed string provided to the ASTextNode.

Comments on your code:
1. You can delete the imageNodeDidFinishDecoding: method. It is not needed in this use case. 
2. Your layoutSpecThatFits code is very close to working. However for image nodes specifically, you will need to specify the size of the node. This is confusing and not very well documented so I apologize. One way to do this is using the mediaNode.preferredFrameSize property. You could set this either in layoutSpecThatFits or in the imageNode:didLoadImage: method. 
3. FYI - layoutSpecs and nodes both conform to the ASLayoutable protocol, which means that you can mix and match them in the setChildren method. A more clean (and extensible) way to implement the layout you have would be to do something like below. Check out how the mediaNode is vertically stacked with the commentsNode inside the mainStack.

Regarding the conversion to instance methods, this was one of the top three most important framework performance optimizations for the Pinterest app.  The creation of draw parameters, Which had to occur on the main thread, proved so expensive that it was directly responsible for small frame drops (e.g. 20-50ms of work).

1715,2016-06-06 15:18:29,"@bimawa this is great, thanks for putting it up as a PR. As a suggestion of the core behavior of flex gone, I'd recommend simply checking for the property being true at ASLayout flatten time. If the test passes, you can simply exclude it from the final ASLayout sublayout hierarchy.

The other main question we should answer is do we want the ASLayoutable with FlexGone enabled to still calculate it's layout spec? Generally seems like we should forego it and rebuild the entire ASLayout tree that was disabled when the property was YES. If that's the case, you can reduce the footprint of flex gone by checking if the property is YES in an ASDisplayNode's calculateSizeThatFits: and returning a zeroed out ASLayout instead of entering measureWithSizeRange: on the layoutables and having to provide a bunch of boilerplate guard statements.

Then I've been changed `PagerViewController` to subclass `UIViewController` and added `ASPagerNode` as `subnode` to `view`. Now I have correct behaviour (with my `DetailViewController`).

Solution in my case is: make `PagerViewController` not subclassing from `ASViewController`

Thank you for response. My problem is solved, but if you have a time, would be good to know what I'm doing wrong.

#### Update:

After updating `AsyncDisplayKit` to 1.9.8 problem is gone completely even with `ASViewController`

1693,2016-06-04 05:00:56,"@rcancro really fantastic refinements in the last round of updates, thank you! I now feel very confident landing this.

The most important follow-up in my opinion is eliminating the dependence on the object version of the collection for layout specifications. The other one that comes to mind is the creation of a large number of empty arrays, although I am genuinely curious to hear if Foundation optimizes these to be the same pointer. If you could quickly review my other comments, I don't remember with certainty if there are any other areas that are still pending, but you conclusively addressed a significant majority!
",appleguy,rcancro
1692,2016-06-04 05:20:28,"@maicki this is really fantastic, and will allow critical improvements in the developer friendliness of the layout system, By pointing developers to appropriate documentation when it becomes apparent that they are using properties which are not intended for the situation.

I think it is ready to land, however it needs to be rebased, and I would also ask that you put in a flag that sets it to disabled for now. The reason is that we should run it in Pinterest and ask a handful of other developers to try it out to see how many issues it is catching, and to make a decision on whether some of them should be moved into a strict validation mode.

In other words, as one example, I think it is at least possible that valid code sets a few extraneous values which take effect when an element is used in a stack — even if in some other cases it is used outside of the stack (intentionally).

Very cool idea to build this in an extensible way, and I look forward to thinking about expanding this and integrating it directly with the documentation (Hannah can likely help)

ASDK actually makes very very extensive use of GCD.  NSOperation is used by PINRemoteImage, which is also included by ASDK by default.

NSOperation does have significant overheads, and very few benefits (priority is the main one).  This can be very clearly seen with profiling.

The custom thread pool used for asynchronous rendering was added recently, about 6 months ago.  See the commit log and then find the associated PR.  The author was able to show very substantial improvements over GCD.  GCD suffers from a problem called ""thread explosion"" (which Apple describes with warnings in WWDC sessions), in rare cases / certain access patterns.  So for rendering in particular it was found to not be suitable as the thread explosion creates overhead of a relevant amount for the oldest devices.

The upshot is that by using lower level APIs, in most cases we don't take on any unreasonable complexity (like testing pthread instead of isMainThread is extremely easy) -- yet we gain some of the best performance of any framework ever created for iOS, even on the oldest available devices :)

The team is quite busy right now preparing for our Tuesday event (WWDC-week gathering for ASDK users to discuss the future of the framework and profile apps).  We do have two new full time framework developers starting at Pinterest this week.

It will probably take a few weeks for us to get to this issue, but, it should not be extremely complex if you are open to looking at the implementation and finding the right override points to trigger a ""re-check"" of the batch parameters.  There should already be methods that make this a lot easier, things like ""batch fetch if necessary"" that are not too expensive to call if a batch doesn't need to be triggered.  The task is probably as simple as calling the appropriate method more frequently, specifically in the cases of a programmatic scroll.

I believe Max and Yunnan (Xinchi / yunnanwu) have been planning to change the superclass of ASVideoNode to ASNetworkImageNode.  Although this may sound nontraditional, it turns out to provide exactly the desired functionality with exceptionally low overhead.

If a user desires a fixed, static asset placeholder image or to apply one themselves, they could set videoNode.image.  If a thumbnail URL, they simply set videoNode.url, which we could mirror to placeholderImageURL or such.  Even the playButton will properly display over the top of the image content, as would the AVPlayerLayer when added.

This should mean that it's not necessary to set .image / .url = nil even to play the video, although we could do so if we decide to (it would save memory, and the PINRemoteImage fully automatic / default-on memory + disk cache should have us covered.

I will be flying out of town in the next day, but will check in by Monday or so.  Please hop on Slack and pull together a few of the contributors to discuss if we should adapt this PR to change the superclass.  If you're interested to just try this out, I think it should be a straightforward change, mostly deleting the placeholderImageNode!

The iOS code doesn't appear to be capable of pulling a placeholder image from an HLS video stream (the video node appears blank until you tap play), and for my project I need placeholders. This also allows the user to set a placeholder that isn't necessarily a frame of the video.

1677,2016-05-18 08:23:37,"This is good idea to let users set placeholder image, but @appleguy is correct , there were some discussions about making `ASVideoNode` subclass to `ASNetworkImageNode` but i think at this moment this PR will be useful for users.

One more thing is that `ASVideoNode` should be responsible only for playback, we are currently working on `ASVideoPlayerNode` (#1671). Maybe it will be better to move placeholder functionality to `ASVideoPlayerNode`?

1667,2016-06-01 17:37:53,"@appleguy Ok I made the changes.

We had a longer discussion about the fastest way to actually reverse sort the index path array. Let me know if you know a faster way as currently implemented. There is also the `sortedArrayUsingComparator:` method on NSArray, but based on the sorting benchmark and reverse benchmark in this two articles it should be faster to first use `sortedArrayUsingSelector:` and after that use `reverseObjectEnumerator` and `allObject`.

https://www.objc.io/issues/7-foundation/collections/ and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/586370/how-can-i-reverse-a-nsarray-in-objective-c
",maicki,appleguy
1667,2016-06-01 17:40:15,"@maicki I believe there's a method like `as_inverseCompare:` that you could use as the sort selector to directly sort index paths descending.
",Adlai-Holler,maicki

",maicki,Adlai-Holler
1667,2016-06-02 00:09:49,"@appleguy Seems like currently we cannot remove index paths in reverse order. `ASDeleteElementsInMultidimensionalArrayAtIndexPaths` -> `ASRecursivelyUpdateMultidimensionalArrayAtIndexPaths` expects a sorted index path otherwise we assert in `ASDeleteElementsInMultidimensionalArrayAtIndexPaths` with `Indexpath is out of range !`

That's the reason the test is failing at the moment.
",maicki,appleguy
1667,2016-06-02 00:15:32,"Ah, I see.  We should be able to fix that method / create another variant that takes a reverse order, but that’s annoying and definitely a blocker until we get around to it.

Feel free to restore the original comment for now, or push through the multidimensional change.  Also wondering gif it makes sense to add a TwoDimensional optimized variant like the others I added, which helped performance a lot.

1663,2016-05-16 01:15:00,"Very interesting!  Still following this.  Adlai, it doesn’t seem urgent, but if you can reproduce Michael’s comments it seems like the main issue here was some transient problem in Cocoapods rc.

Although I’m not yet convinced we should make a change, if you have any reference that this style is preferred / expected for referencing files within a project (even in public headers), I’d be happy for us to adopt that.  The only reason I had the sense that framework includes were better is that the text of the header file is pulled into code being compiled at the application level, and in that context (no longer inside the framework), referencing other headers is properly done via the framework specifier.

1656,2016-06-04 21:39:09,"@Xinchi I've thought carefully about this and also discussed with @hannahmbanana about API naming.  My original opinion matched @binl and I think there is some question about the flexibility of the original API name.  Your work here matched it perfectly and is correct, it simply exposed some limitations in the flexibility of the original name choice.

However, after further consideration, I think we should move forward with this as-is.  I am likely to want to rename this to something more generic later, like ASCellNodeInterfaceEvent..., but this would be a breaking API change and is not worth doing at this moment (we should consider it for 2.0 though).

In the end, the reason I'm happy to land this is that I definitely agree the functionality is related to the use cases for the other values.  They are all related to a cell monitoring its relationship with the scrollable content area.  It is always possible to solve problems like this at the application level - however, ASDK's main goal is to provide conveniences wherever they don't get in the way / slow things down, specifically to reduce the complexity of application code and make powerful capabilities easy.  Avoiding the need for application level delegate patterns is definitely a simplification.

Thanks for carefully thinking about this, making a very clean change to core framework code, and advocating for why this is the right solution — as well as thinking through alternatives.

If you can rebase it, I'll merge ASAP.

Your work here matched it perfectly and is correct, it simply exposed some limitations in the flexibility of the original name choice.

However, after further consideration, I think we should move forward with this as-is.  I am likely to want to rename this to something more generic later, like ASCellNodeInterfaceEvent..., but this would be a breaking API change and is not worth doing at this moment (we should consider it for 2.0 though).

In the end, the reason I'm happy to land this is that I definitely agree the functionality is related to the use cases for the other values.  They are all related to a cell monitoring its relationship with the scrollable content area.  It is always possible to solve problems like this at the application level - however, ASDK's main goal is to provide conveniences wherever they don't get in the way / slow things down, specifically to reduce the complexity of application code and make powerful capabilities easy.  Avoiding the need for application level delegate patterns is definitely a simplification.

Thanks for carefully thinking about this, making a very clean change to core framework code, and advocating for why this is the right solution — as well as thinking through alternatives.

If you can rebase it, I'll merge ASAP.

1642,2016-06-07 06:18:33,"A much, much better option is to manually calculate the content offset.  You can use setContentOffset: right away.  This would probably require manually setting the contentSize to at least that amount, though; it will then be reset as the collection loads its content for the pager.

A tricker but even better solution would be to initially add just the page you want to show to the datasource (as the /only/ page), so it shows up quickly, but then insert all the other pages and scroll to the correct page.  Done carefully, this could be really slick.

Overall, make sure you try to avoid exposing many hundred or thousands of items to the data source all at once.  If you can limit that to under a hundred, it is usually acceptable to use -waitUntilAllTransactionsAreCommitted in viewWillAppear: and then you can scroll to the correct page immediately.

- @bimawa: I have only one idea its add property to ASLayoutSpec class. But maybe community can invent better ideas? but like u spot its make a bit less declarative. But from another side its property like `flexShrink` similar props. We can try add this to `ASLayoutable.h` protocol. Call it like `flexVisible` with default propery `YES` and if this property is `NO` skip Spec from calculation in layouts.
- @nguyenhuy: that’s one good approach. The thing I’m concerning is how this implementation would affect other properties, especially stack related ones. I need a bit more time to think about this.

@Adlai-Holler The regeneration of UIImage's on request _is_ an unfortunate side effect :/ I thought it better to store only the NSData for alternate representation support. The only way I can see around this is to also store the UIImage which is essentially a copy of the NSData.

I'm open to suggestions around changing ASPINRemoteImageDownloader to use the public instance. The specific problem with that is the version used by ASDK needs to be the alternative representation provider.

Do you think we should expose sharedPINRemoteImageManager? Can you think of another solution?
",garrettmoon,Adlai-Holler
1632,2016-05-10 01:36:20,"@garrettmoon Would it be possible to use NSDatas when the image was created with an alternate representation and UIImages otherwise? It's definitely not critically urgent but I think that would work.

Maybe make `alternateRepresentationProvider` publicly mutable and nullable on PINRemoteImageManager.  Then `ASPINRemoteImageDownloader` can dispatch-once set itself on the shared manager, if the user hasn't already set some other provider.
",Adlai-Holler,garrettmoon
1632,2016-05-10 01:59:28,"@Adlai-Holler The problem with storing the UIImage or NSData depending is that you can opt out of an alternative representation on a per-request basis. This means one request could ask for an alternative representation and then the next opt out. Because there's no NSData, we can't fulfill that request without hitting the disk cache.

The reason I didn't make alternativeRepresentationProvider a mutable property is that we'd need to add some sort of locking mechanism for reading it. Currently, PINRemoteImage never locks on the main thread and I was hoping to continue that :( There may be a way around this using atomic swaps, but I haven't looked into it.

Crashlytics issue #1 is most likely caused by returning Nil for a cell node. `nodeForItem:` and `nodeBlockForItem:` both must not return a nil cell node (same as UIKit, ASDK will crash on a nil cell).

One way to inadvertently do this is by accessing `indexPath` in the `ASCellNodeBlock` returned from `nodeBlockForItem:`.  It is very important that node blocks be thread-safe. One aspect of that is ensuring that the data model is accessed outside of the node block. Therefore, it is unlikely that you should need to use the index inside of the block.

I have not had chance to do a new release and am taking an international flight in the next 36hrs, so I might suggest you ship your next release with master (we do this as a matter of course with Pinterest, so it should be good enough :) — typically better than the last 'stable' release).

Are you saying that the ASTextNode's text is centered when you do not set flexBasis? Without the `setupLabels` method, I cannot confirm that you are directly setting the ASTextNode's text to be centered (as required), using the paragraph style. For multiple lines of text, the `. alignSelf` property will not center an ASTextNode's text. 

A few unrelated notes:
1. Have you joined the ASDK Slack yet? For directions, check out #1582
2. By using Implicit Node Hierarchy Management (beta feature, which will be enabled by default soon), you can remove the code explicitly adding the subnodes:



You will need to `import ""ASDisplayNode+Beta.h""` (while still beta) and set `self.usesImplicitHierarchyManagement = YES` in init.

1626,2016-05-07 01:22:15,"@ShaunakP: Before addressing the specifics of this question, I'm curious if you've looked into ASNetworkImageNode's placeholder property (`.defaultImage`)? 

The modern UI style for loading images in apps seems to be a static grey or default image background. For example, Pinterest's home feed uses solid color ""images"" as placeholders to represent images that are still downloading.

If this style would work for your app, you can save TONS of code using ASNetworkImageNode's built in .defaultImage property. You just have to subclass the ASNetworkImageNode to return the placeholder image that you would like to show. ASDK will do the rest - displaying the default image and removing it when the real image finishes downloading and rendering.   

Let me know if you've already heard of this, or are still interested in making the spinner work. I would happy to help debugging your original issue. 
",hannahmbanana,ShaunakP
1626,2016-05-09 03:57:19,"@hannahmbanana  Thanks for the suggestion. However, our requirement is such that we need to show a infinitely rotating spinner when the image is downloading. It would be helpful if we can look into the issue.
",ShaunakP,hannahmbanana
1626,2016-05-11 14:25:44,"@ShaunakP I believe that CoreAnimation cancels animations when a layer exits a window.

I'm just a bit worried about the performance impact we will hit if we update more synchronously instead of batching it once per run loop. Did you do any testing around it?

Would also be interesting to understand more why `self.visibleCells -> [self indexPathForCell:]` will return nil if called synchronously from `-willDisplayCell:forRowAtIndexPath`. Could there be other side effects we could ran into if we synchronously update?
",maicki,Adlai-Holler
1619,2016-05-20 20:08:36,"Great points @maicki! With them in mind, I'm thinking about how to improve this approach. I'm just going to store some thoughts here as I attack this.

### The Goal

We want to update the range controller **synchronously**, just **after** each **batch** of visible node changes is committed.
- _After_ because during `willDisplayCell:` the cell isn't quite setup for the new item (i.e. in the hierarchy, in the lookup tables, at the correct frame) yet, so unexpected behavior (like the indexPathForCell: failing) may occur if we pretend otherwise.
- _Synchronous_ because we want to guarantee that the range state is correct before the next frame is drawn.
- _Batch_ because it's potentially expensive to recalculate the ranges more than once per layout change. **Q** I haven't profiled this yet – it would be good to know the relative cost.

### How UITableView/UICollectionView Change Visible Index Paths

There are three reasons for a visible index paths change:
1. bounds change (scrolling, resizing). 
   - This case is pretty easy to cover. Table view and collection view always perform visible cell changes during `layoutSubviews`.
   - We can simply add a flag like `visibleIndexPathsDidChangeDuringLayoutSubviews`, and check it after `[super layoutSubviews]`.
   - If it's changed, then we tell the range controller to update.
2. A batch of editing operations that intersects the visible area.
3. A single editing operation that intersects the visible area.

### Our Hooks
- `willDisplayCell:` This is called just before a cell is assigned an index path and added into the view. Note that the cell may already be in the view (for some previous item) or it may not.
- `didEndDisplayingCell:` This is called just after a cell is unassigned its index path. Note that the cell may be removed from the view or it may not.
- `super layoutSubviews:` Useful override point.
- `super performBatchUpdates:` Useful override point. UICollectionView synchronously updates visible cells during this, including calls to `willDisplay:` and `didEndDisplaying:`
- `super insert/delete/move/reload:` We call these and I suspect **Q** that collection view & table view synchronously update the visible index paths if these are called outside a batch.

### Other Case: Update Animation End

When a table view (**Q** also collection view?) update animation ends, we may get a `didEndDisplayingCell:` call. This can't be predicted and it's not tied into the UIKit layout passes. Unfortunately, the only case where we get a update animation completion hook is in the UICollectionView batch update case. 

We could expand that hook to cover all updates, if we always wrap isolated update calls (e.g. `insertItemsAtIndexPaths:`) in batch updates but that still leaves us out in the cold for table view updates. As far as I know, there is no table view update animation completion hook.

I'm going to keep playing with this and mulling it over, because it's so valuable and yet so delicate. Feedback/thoughts much appreciated @maicki @appleguy @nguyenhuy

",Adlai-Holler,appleguy
1619,2016-06-20 18:50:56,"This PR got pretty huge =/. Here's what ended up happening:
- Remove `ASRangeController.scrollDirection` and replace with new data source method `scrollDirectionForRangeController:`
- ASRangeController now exposes 2 update methods `setNeedsUpdate` and `updateIfNeeded`
- setNeedsUpdate sets a flag and (if needed) enqueues an `updateIfNeeded` call onto the main queue
- updateIfNeeded clears the flag and performs the update
- Table and collection view call setNeedsUpdate in willDisplayCell:/didDisplayCell:
- Table and collection view call `updateIfNeeded` after `-layoutSubviews`, after submitting data update operations, and after update animations end (only supported for collection view.)
- Optimize `ASTableView.indexPathsForVisibleNodes:` significantly
- Add conditional code to ASRangeController to log frames that contain multiple range updates.
  - Currently during scrolling we never see this, but we sometimes see 2-5 updates during the same frame when update operations are occurring or when table/collections appear.
  - The code in `-[Collection/Table didMoveToWindow:]` needs scrutiny. Are both calls necessary?
- Move enforcement of cell node neverShowPlaceholders into the cell node's visibility callback, out from willDisplayCell:. This way `ensureDisplay` is called after the cell is already added to the hierarchy, and it also reduces class interdependency.

Notes:
- In -[ASCollectionView layoutSubviews] I had to gate the -updateIfNeeded behind `if (self.window != nil)`. If this isn't present, the client app crashes (~80% reliable) with a collection view data integrity problem under certain conditions. It's a very weird issue, I dug into it a little and bailed because we'll flush the range update in didMoveToWindow anyway.

Questions:
- ASRangeController has a `_rangeIsValid` flag that seems to trigger a re-evaluation of the range states of all nodes when the collection view data is updated. Is that correct? I'm thinking we rename it to avoid confusion between `_rangeIsValid` and the new `_needsRangeUpdate` flag.

This has been tested thoroughly but it's obviously a very significant change to very important code. Sorry for the burden, but I think it'll be worth it! Feel free to meet with me in person as needed. Need review @appleguy @maicki @nguyenhuy

- Remove `ASRangeController.scrollDirection` and replace with new data source method `scrollDirectionForRangeController:`
- ASRangeController now exposes 2 update methods `setNeedsUpdate` and `updateIfNeeded`
- setNeedsUpdate sets a flag and (if needed) enqueues an `updateIfNeeded` call onto the main queue
- updateIfNeeded clears the flag and performs the update
- Table and collection view call setNeedsUpdate in willDisplayCell:/didDisplayCell:
- Table and collection view call `updateIfNeeded` after `-layoutSubviews`, after submitting data update operations, and after update animations end (only supported for collection view.)
- Optimize `ASTableView.indexPathsForVisibleNodes:` significantly
- Add conditional code to ASRangeController to log frames that contain multiple range updates.
  - Currently during scrolling we never see this, but we sometimes see 2-5 updates during the same frame when update operations are occurring or when table/collections appear.
  - The code in `-[Collection/Table didMoveToWindow:]` needs scrutiny. Are both calls necessary?
- Move enforcement of cell node neverShowPlaceholders into the cell node's visibility callback, out from willDisplayCell:. This way `ensureDisplay` is called after the cell is already added to the hierarchy, and it also reduces class interdependency.

Notes:
- In -[ASCollectionView layoutSubviews] I had to gate the -updateIfNeeded behind `if (self.window != nil)`. If this isn't present, the client app crashes (~80% reliable) with a collection view data integrity problem under certain conditions. It's a very weird issue, I dug into it a little and bailed because we'll flush the range update in didMoveToWindow anyway.

Questions:
- ASRangeController has a `_rangeIsValid` flag that seems to trigger a re-evaluation of the range states of all nodes when the collection view data is updated. Is that correct? I'm thinking we rename it to avoid confusion between `_rangeIsValid` and the new `_needsRangeUpdate` flag.

This has been tested thoroughly but it's obviously a very significant change to very important code. Sorry for the burden, but I think it'll be worth it! Feel free to meet with me in person as needed. Need review @appleguy @maicki @nguyenhuy

@eanagel has the background on the pending index path.  Unfortunately it was very necessary and we were able to prove that UITableView does not necessarily include information that we expected it should be guaranteed to.  I looked into the history around this in detail about a month ago, it can be found by seeking back through various PRs and related issues.  It would be fantastic to eliminate.

@eanagel if you have any mechanism for us to test that original issue - I think you had a test project, or at least ability to reproduce it in your app - that would help.  Running your app against this PR would in fact be of phenomenal value to the community.

I think we should treat these nodes specially, doing something like an implied flexBasis of 1 / numberOfItems or some other mechanism for automatically constraining them in the infinite dimension.  Importantly, do you have any ideas for how the layout might be made valid in this case?

@nguyenhuy, @maicki how might we address this?  Is it tracked in whole or in part by a task in Ship, or related to any other planned changes?  It is possible that there is not actually a defined solution to this (I can't immediately think of one).
",appleguy,adamastern
1611,2016-05-06 16:34:09,"@appleguy This is tracked with Ship issue nr: 110

I just run into that issue while fixing some layout issues with ASVideoNode see #1630 . The problem was that as constrainedSize in `layoutSpecThatFits:` an infinite width was passed in. As this issue is describing, layout nodes or set size ranges with infinite values is not possible and results with a crash. What we do is to catch that and see if a `preferredFrameSize` is given for the ASVideoNode otherwise assert out and let the consumer know to set a `preferredFrameSize` in this case.

To address the root issue in here I think we should catch infinite values in `layoutSpecThatFits:` or `calculateSizeThatFits:` constrainedSize values that do not make sense and let the developer know that they have to set values (like preferredFrameSize or sizeRange+ASStackLayout) for this kind of situations.

Btw we can have the same situation in `ASImageNode` if no preferredFrameSize or image size if given in time of layout.

Main feedback: it does not make sense to return NO for should enter player state Finished.  So I worry that it is possible that the state is not sufficiently broken up into logically distinct categories that integrate with the delegate methods in a fully consistent way.  I won't have time to think about a better solution soon, and it's not urgent to change, but I do worry about making breaking API changes here once we get around to a refinement so the sooner we think of an improvement, the better!  2.0 is a good time to make the breaking changes of this sort though so we have at least a month, don't rush on your side.

1605,2016-04-29 05:03:38,"Thanks @lappp9 !  @maicki, @levi, @nguyenhuy I could use your help considering the API here.

We definitely need these call points.  Things like displayWillStart are not actually called for elements that don't have a literal display method, and something like -clearFetchedData doesn't feel parallel to -visibilityDidChange:.

That said, I'm not a fan of these particular names.  They seem a bit too long, at least the ""Range"" part should probably be removed as we plan to have ASViewController also have an independent ASInterfaceState, which might be in the fetch data state just by being one of the non-selected tabs of a tab bar controller (not a range exactly).

We should see if any names could be found that will allow the BOOL parameter to work, as it fully halves the number of strings that a developer needs to remember to use the API without looking at headers or reference.  ..., displayStateDidChange: is one candidate, not sure it's great though.
",appleguy,lappp9
1605,2016-05-01 19:22:04,"@appleguy yeah, I agree that the BOOL versions of these methods would make things quite a bit nicer.
So:
`-visibilityDidChange:`
`-displayStateDidChange:`
`-fetchDataStateDidChange:` 

The display one sounds good. The fetchData one feels a little weird, but I think it would make sense with the other ones.  Does anyone else have opinions?

Maybe?
`-dataFetchStateDidChange:`
",lappp9,appleguy
1605,2016-05-03 20:03:06,"@levi I would love to do it that way, but in practice it is quite hard to isolate whether a bit has changed, _and_ whether it is now 1 or 0.  Just checking whether it's set is not enough.  E.g. FetchData may be 1 now, but it may also have been 1 before.

The ASDisplayNode implementation of interfaceStateDidChange: shows some of the patterns that developers would have to individually figure out how to reconstruct.

Also, I think the things you need to do in entering / exiting fetchData will typically be different than when visibility changes, etc.  But it does seem like entering and exiting often have similar needs / variable interactions
",appleguy,levi

1598,2016-04-27 05:33:40,"@dermotos: Great question!

There isn't currently an API to access the child view controller. There are a few ways to get around this - for example, using a delegate - depending on what you are trying to do. If you are able to share more details or give an example from another app, I'm sure we can figure out a simple solution that doesn't require changing your app design. 

Alternatively, the authors of the framework are usually happy to consider adding accessors if you can give them a good enough reason to. :)

1595,2016-04-27 05:44:41,"@DavidSchechter: ASTextNodes _should_ be accessible. Several of the framework developers have put a great deal of effort into integrating with accessibility APIs, even in seemingly impossible situations, such as when a node hierarchy has no views associated with it (layerBacked, or completely flattened rasterized hierarchy). Even in these cases, the current version of ASDK should provide granule, specific, sub-rectangles that may each have individual accessibility parameters. 

What version of ASDK are you using? Are you on the ASDK slack channel (#1582)? This is an area of  top focus right now, so it would be great if you could be in direct contact.

1594,2016-06-30 16:23:27,"@appleguy You think this is more related to the locking issues in `ASTextNode` we had? Setting an attributed string triggers a redraw ...
",maicki,appleguy
1594,2016-07-01 03:30:47,"@klivin Two things:
- setAttributedText: is ideal to call on a background thread.  This can be done when the cell is first created by ensuring you're using the nodeBlockForItemAtIndexPath: API (make sure any accesses to the data source that you need the indexPath for are done OUTSIDE the block - e.g. to get the data model that you want to set on the cell, you should do this outside the block).  The stacks you shared show that the main thread is waiting because it is setting text on a node that is currently drawing, which is not ideal; if you have a common need to update the text of an already-onscreen element, it's probably worth it to do a dispatch_async before you actually set the text.
- There are some important fixes to ASTextNode locking in the master branch that should resolve this crash.  We never found a reproduction case for it, and it seemed fairly rare, in that although it did occur in volume for the Pinterest app it was never a top crash (and we have never found that repro case).  The fixes will be in the 1.9.81 release, but because of the holiday weekend, this might not go out until next week.  Nonetheless we are shipping Pinterest on the current master and believe it is in stable condition at this time, so I encourage you to update if this crash is affecting your app.  It is very possible (even likely) that the somewhat atypical access pattern in the stacks, updating the existing text while drawing, makes your app more likely to trigger the crash than most — so it's especially worth it to use master for now.

This is probably appropriate for another place, and I'll create a new issue - I have been having a general issue with ASTextNode around auto-scale text.

The sentence before the code looks correct. I could probably make it more clear that `initWithNode:` is the ASViewController's designated initializer. This is the strategy for using an ASCollectionNode with an ASViewController, but it is also possible to use an ASCollectionNode without managing it with an ASViewController.

ASButtonNode was added after this example app was created. This example app needs some updating, including converting the ASControlNode you identified into an ASButtonNode. So you were correct in your intuition that it would be better as an ASButtonNode. 

As for the difference between ASButtonNode vs ASControlNode: ASButtonNode is a subclass of ASControlNode and adds different features like title text support, background/foreground images, different states, etc. Similar to how a UIButton extends a UIControl. 

Could you provide more information on how to reproduce this image bug? I ran your project in the simulator (thanks for including it!) but was not able to reproduce the issue with clicking, scrolling, etc. 

It may have to do with rasterization, which I see is toggled in the `didSelectRowAtIndexPath` method. Try commenting that out and see if it resolves the bug. 
",hannahmbanana,alexrmacleod
1586,2016-04-24 11:30:57,"@hannahmbanana thanks for the response, you were right... the lack of rasterization in the `didSelectRowAtIndexPath` was causing the issue with the background image on the `ASControlNode`. Below is what fixed the problem.



However there is a new problem, when I select a cell, the ""hairline"" divider on the postNode disappears after the cellNode is de-selected. I think its a problem related to #1417 . Did you find a solution for this?
",alexrmacleod,hannahmbanana
1586,2016-04-24 19:30:22,"@alexrmacleod: #1417 (rasterization) is still a known problem. 

For now, try removing the rasterization stuff completely. It was in the SocialAppLayout example mainly for developers of ASDK to test this special use feature. I think it should probably be removed. Most apps don't need it anywhere, but if you don't depend on background color it should still be useable. 

Are you on the ASDK slack? If you're interested in using this ASDK feature, it'd be good to get more info there. 

Rasterization flattens the whole node subtree into just a single view, which eliminates subviews and sublayers from being created. It's a valuable advanced performance optimization, but it will prevent you from independently animating anything in the subtree. In certain cases, if individual subnodes change (e.g. 3 network image nodes), it will have to reload each time.

1586,2016-04-24 22:54:39,"@alexrmacleod, I agree with @hannahmbanana that we should actually remove the tap-to-rasterize hidden feature of SocialAppLayout - even in the ObjC version.

The known issue here is that some kinds of rasterized elements don't properly reflect their backgroundColor, if they were initially displayed non-rasterized and then rasterization is enabled (as occurs with the tap-to-rasterize).  Especially to toggle the rasterization state is an astoundingly rare thing to do in a real app, and I'd recommend avoiding rasterization until you become pretty familiar with the framework and even learn a few of the implementation details.  It has big side effects like losing touch handling for subnodes of that tree, but is extremely powerful as a carefully wielded performance tool.

1586,2016-04-28 06:22:28,"@alexrmacleod: Regarding the MGSwipeTableCell. It is definitely not possible to use a UITableViewCell subclass directly, but it is possible to wrap any other type of UIView (for example UIButton, UIImageView, colored square UIViews, etc) and put them inside node hierarchies.

There are 2 ways to do this, and whether it is possible to reuse the code from the MGSwipeTableCell at all is unclear, but it probably would be best done with the first approach below:
1. Use the didLoad method in your ASCellNode subclass, which is called on the main thread and is the earliest opportunity to access the self.view of the node. Here, you can add any number of regular UIViews as subviews, even a deep hierarchy of multiple levels of views. Views that are manually added in this way cannot be positioned using a layoutSpec, so you must either set autolayout constraints on them, or preferentially use the -layout method in exactly the same way as you might use -layoutSubviews when writing a view subclass. FYI - it is never recommended to use autolayout constraints on a view that is managed by a node, only on manually created views of this sort, and all of the negative performance of autolayout will still apply. 
2. Using a node to wrap custom views. The advantage of this approach is primarily for when it is useful to assemble the full hierarchy of elements off the main thread, such as when you need these elements to participate in the asynchronous layout pass (using layoutSpecThatFits:)

All it does is pass through touch events that do NOT land on a link to any views that may be beneath the text node. perhaps the only common use for this is to allow table cells to be selected when tapping a text node that has a link in it

RE:  ASTableView twitter effect - this is possible. As long as the selected state of the cell looks as you intend, it will not fade out until you call `deselectRowAtIndexPath:` This means, instead of triggering the deselection at the moment that the delegate call for the cell being selected is triggered, instead call that method in the `viewControllerViewWillAppear` or ViewDidAppear depending on how long you want the selection state to linger. This is a standard effect (much less common since iOS7, but in iOS6 and earlier this was recommended by apple as best practice to reinforce to the user which cell they had just returned from the detail controller of. If this doesn’t work for you, you may not be selecting the row as you intend, so set a breakpoint in the didSelectRow.. just to make sure it’s being called. When you move deselctRowAtIndexPath: to viewControllerViewWillAppear, you will need to use the method selectedIndexPaths (or something like that - can’t remember the name off the top of my head) since the indexPath won’t be available

1586,2016-04-30 11:31:47,"@hannahmbanana I find that using `self.iconNode!.backgroundColor = UIColor.clearColor()` would make things a little easier if your cells have a custom background colour.

Question 1:
Re: MGSwipeTableCell - option 2 means it is possible to take something like **BEMCheckBox** and wrap it in a **ASDisplayNode** however because **MGSwipeTableCell** is a subclass of **UITableViewCell** and I'm currently using **ASTableNode** which only works with **ASCellNode** there really isn't a quick fix for this and would probably be much more work than its worth?

Example:
What I am aiming for is the below image of a Cell from another app. Which has something like MGSwipeTableCell going on as well.

Eventually I will put the mini line chart with something like **PNChart** in the middle of each cell and was worried that if I do that it could cause a regular UITableViewCell to drop lots of FPS when scrolling / or not even work on ASCellNode.

Question 2:
So if am I to use MGSwipeTableCell with PNChart. I should just use the regular **UITableViewController**, build the cells programatically using **UIStackView** and, try to keep the cells as simple as possible by avoiding storyboard, interface builder and autoLayout? and perhaps i'll be able to add the lineChart down the road and it won't effect performance too much? 

Thanks for the twitter effect explanation. Nice actionable advice.

1586,2016-05-01 07:16:31,"@alexrmacleod haha, having seen those (very cleanly designed) screenshots, I'm definitely really engaged with helping you figure this out.  It reminds me more than a little of building a highly-optimized cell for Apple's Stocks.app, including the first predecessor design of view-based asynchronous rendering that I made for the chart rendering.  No other first-party app used a similar approach at least through 4.3, and I doubt afterwards :-P.  I'd love to see your app succeed technically and have insanely perfect performance.

However, I think the best way is to simply rebuild the swiping functionality, and we could put it in ASCellNode itself.  Honestly it should not be that hard to take an array of colors and strings for the button types revealed by the drag, right?  Do you have a video of interacting with a few examples of this component, maybe with 1, 2, 3 items etc?

The one problem is that I have a significant time crunch in the next few days.  Still, I could work with either you or someone else from the community to build it within a week (max 1 total day of work including API design and full implementation through testing).

I'm wondering if you would be able to send over the code, dropped into a duplicate of any project in Examples / (you can just do Cmd-D on any folder in examples, rename the folder, and delete any code not necessary to get up and running one ASCellNode in a similar environment to your app where we could test dragging to reveal the menu).

If this sounds OK, you could cut out any data model and any other part of the app, just hardcoding some string values.  If you feel motivated, it would be better to have it as a table with 100-200 items, maybe repeating ~10 stock infos of varying lengths, character sets, etc.  Then I could profile it and make sure scrolling is optimized.

Then, it'd be up to you, but this would actually make a sweet app for examples/ .  Or I can keep the code completely confidential and delete it after our work.

Make sure to ping @maicki, @hannahmbanana and myself for any questions on Slack.  I don't think there's a great route to use MGSwipeTableCell and make very direct use of ASDK though.

I think including the node as an argument, although not strictly necessary if the user correctly uses a weak pointer, maybe a good idea to encourage the pattern of accessing through that object and as a reminder to consider memory management.

1554,2016-04-19 18:42:03,"@muzammil-hussain: This looks like code from ASDK's old website. The new website is a work in progress, but currently has some updated documentation.

If you are just using a _single_ ASDK node in a UIViewController, the code you have (which adds the node's view directly) is valid. However, it is highly recommended that you use a ""node container"" such as an ASTableNode, ASCollectionNode or ASViewController to get the maximum benefit of the framework. With these node containers, you would addSubnode: rather than dealing directly with the node's view. 

To see these node containers in action, the ASDKgram example app is a great place to start. It shows a comparison of a UIKit implemented photo feed vs a ASDK implemented photo feed. If you are trying to port an existing app, this is a good reference. 

When using these recommended node containers, the standard practice is to initialize nodes and add subnodes on the main thread. I believe this is because the cost of initializing an ASDK node is very minimal in comparison to rendering text, decoding images, etc. 

It would help to know a little more about what you a trying to do. Have you joined the ASDK Slack channel? If not, you should consider joining us as it is easiest to have conversations on Slack. :) Email AsyncDisplayKit@gmail.com for an invite. 
",hannahmbanana,muzammil-hussain
1554,2016-04-20 03:19:58,"@muzammil-hussain although it is great to initialize nodes off of the main thread when possible, this is a small minority of the total amount of work that most applications have on the main thread.

Even when you allocate notes on the main thread, the framework will automatically move layout and display to concurrent background queues.  The layout operations are managed by a table, collection, or pager node.  The display operations are built into ASDisplayNode itself, and so even in the case that you use a node as a direct sub view of a regular review hierarchy, it will still render asynchronously (but this is discouraged, as no system will tell the node to render an advance as is the case in the other containers mentioned).

All that said, the framework has a variety of other advanced techniques to improve performance. Even with main thread work, the framework is able to dramatically reduce its impact on the user experience by way of the rather amazing ASRunloopQueue.  This breaks up operations that must be performed on the main thread into far smaller chunks, easily 1/10th of the size that they otherwise would be, so that operation such as allocating UIViews or even destroying objects can be spread out and allow the run loops to frequently turn.  This frequent turning allows the device to much more frequently check if a user touch has started or if an animation timer requires a new frame to be drawn, allowing far greater responsiveness even when the device is very busy and processing a large queue of main thread work.

It's a longer discussion why this kind of technique is extremely challenging to implement with UIKit, but it has to do with the fact that ASDK prepares content in advance, giving it a buffer of time where it can spread out the creation of these objects in tiny chunks.  If it doesn't finish by the time it needs to be on screen, then it finishes the rest of what needs to be created in a single chunk.  UIKit has no similar mechanisms to create things in advance, and there is always just one huge chunk as a view controller or cell needs to come on screen.

Please join us on slack and I would love to see any additional questions and discussion shared with the overall group. Let us know if we can help you get started.

After some digging, if found out that this delegate ( and the other belonging to the same protocol)

gets called when i send my app to background. This all happens on an unvisited tab bar ASViewController ASDisplayNode. The ASCollectionView is added as a ASDisplayNode subnode.
Is this the expected behavior?

1543,2016-04-16 22:41:25,"@aaronschubert0 I'm pretty sure this was added recently, as @Adlai-Holler discovered that MapKit will internally crash if provided a zero size options.    If it was not this particular assertion, there were other changes intended to protect against zero sized snapshots that are definitely still required. 

I'm not understanding  how this would fix the issue Hannah ran into, though.  If the options has never been set to a non-zero size, and setAnnotations: is called (eg before the view is created, and before layout), we trigger a snapshot.  And it will be zero sized.

How does this address that issue?
",appleguy,aaronschubert0
1543,2016-04-17 08:10:08,"Hey @appleguy, I actually added that assert in when I first implemented ASMapNode and the reason was to combat options.size being set to zero. That's why I can be so certain that we can remove this. Since following the changes that @Adlai-Holler made, there are no code paths possible where options.size can be set to zero (and it's set to 256x256 from MapKit by default)

Hannah's issue wasn't that options.size was zero sized. It was that her code hit this false assert, options.size was never set to zero. If Hannah tries out this fix then I'm certain her issue will be resolved. 

I also made a sample project based upon Hannah's example code that I can post if you want to look at that before Hannah gets a chance to try out this fix.

1537,2016-04-16 04:04:24,"@maicki interesting.  So, there is actually a similar workaround for frame.  UITableView frame does not work properly if it is set only on the layer, unlike almost all other UIViews.

I think the right fix here is actually to change the property bridge, and always use -[UIView setBackgroundColor:] for a view-backed node.  Otherwise, initWithViewBlock: on certain elements like perhaps a custom table (that a developer doesn't need to be async) will have the same issue.  There could also be other UIKit classes that override setBackgroundColor: -- because it is difficult for UIKit to intercept the CALayer calls in the way our architecture allows.  Lastly, it would reduce the code change.

We would need to change the _ASPendingState to always store a UIColor as regenerating it is too costly.  This is fine as the node.backgroundColor is already of this type.  It would actually make some drawing operations faster as capturing it as a draw parameter would be quicker that regenerating.  For layer-backed we'd call CGColor.

If you'd prefer to land this as-is and file a task for the other change, that's totally fine.  I'm not certain how complex the diff would be to make, but it may be simple enough to do now.  @maicki just let me know and I will merge this now if you suggest.

This assert is usually called if you haven't specified a layout to ASMapNode correctly, usually I would wrap it in a `ASRatioLayoutSpec` or set the `preferredFrameSize` property. What UI are you trying to construct, and maybe we can solve this a different way?
",aaronschubert0,hannahmbanana
1534,2016-04-15 08:04:23,"@aaronschubert0: thanks for reviewing this!

I believe I am using the ASMapNode API correctly; `.setAnnotations` should be okay to call before the layout pass. If I move the `.setAnnotations` code to `didLoad` everything works smoothly.  However, the former implementation seems like it should be a valid use of the API.


",hannahmbanana,aaronschubert0
1534,2016-04-15 09:02:57,"@hannahmbanana In that case, why don't we wrap `setAnnotations:` with `self.nodeLoaded`:



So that the annotations are set, but it won't trigger a new layout pass unless it's been loaded or maybe we should actually change that condition to `self.calculatedLayout` that way we can be certain this behaviour won't occur.

Hey everyone, thanks for your patience here.  Initially we had only one report of this.  Then weeks later, a second report.  Only now is it clear that this is affecting a lot of people.  Most developers I've worked directly with are using the static library because of its superior performance, so I didn't realize the impact of this.

I would consider it a Cocoapods issue insofar as 1) Cocoapods permits these version numbers with no warning, and they do not cause an issue for static libraries, 2) This issue does not affect Carthage users, to my knowledge, 3) Cocoapods could easily overwrite the framework version in the metadata with any value they want, as it is not used at that stage, especially for 4-digit version numbers that their stack accepts as valid pod versions.

That said, we will push a new version of the framework in the next day or two.  @maicki and I are getting ready for this unplanned release.  We will need to distort the version numbering scheme and use something like 1.9.73 as we have a large amount of material tracked under the 1.9.8, etc releases and GitHub provides no batch editing functionality.  So we will release that as 1.9.80.  Once 2.0 is released, we will resume a strictly 3-number versioning scheme and eliminate the two-digit minor version.  Let me know if you have any better ideas, but this seems like a relatively low-cost fix (annoying, but I think it is less annoying than changing all our release tracking documents and running into 1.9.10)

As the name implies, data loading and layout is asynchronous.  So you could be selecting a row that does not actually exist at the moment.  This is an issue I will leave open because we can pretty easily integrate this API so it puts the select operation on the ""editing transaction queue"", so that it is automatically performed after operations queued to that point have been run.

The most important question is one version of the framework you're using. Integrating with an NSFRC is an important use case that is supported, but it is definitely one of the more stressful test of the system and older versions of the framework did not fully support it. Make sure you are using 1.9.7.1, and you might try clearing your Pod state and reinstalling.

Is there a particular flow that allows you to reproduce this, or is it fairly random?

Something that would be of great value to the community is a simple example case that uses a fetched results controller. We could then integrate this with unit tests, and it would also help reproduce issues of this nature.

The good news is that I am not aware of any other reports of an issue like this using the framework built in the past month or so. So, I think there is a good chance that we will be able to find a small issue in how the framework has been integrated and solve the problem for you.
",appleguy,ankorko
1493,2016-04-26 18:58:27,"@ankorko Have you tried processing your updates serially with concurrency control?  For example you can setup a dispatch_group on your view controller then when lock/unlock datasource is called on the `ASTableViewDatasource` you can call dispatch_group_enter/dispatch_group_leave respectively and then batch your changes into a dispatch_group_notify.  `NSFetchedResultsController` doesn't provide a way to model a set of changes out-of-the-box but there are tools that let you do this (I use a variant of https://github.com/wtmoose/TLIndexPathTools).

The approach you described is fine, although you may need to look at a more comprehensive way to trigger the menu to close. For example, if the user touches outside of the cell, you might not be able to detect that tap.

The other comments about a different style simply reference replicating the general the the Appearance of the menu controller but with a more customized implementation that allows a user to define their own images or for the menu controller. The menu controller is not a particularly complex component, and so building something custom could be reasonable. However, if it matches your application interface, it is certainly a fine approach to integrated directly. It might not make as much sense for the framework itself because many Applications using this framework have a very custom interface that would not readily match with the menu controller.
",appleguy,DavidSchechter
1489,2016-04-08 03:22:10,"Thanks @Eke for putting up the PR! I think it is a step in the right direction.

That said, speaking with a few coworkers today, they pointed out that the scope of possible states are not all things that should be possible for a developer to set. For example, when playing is finished, this is not necessarily a state that should be available to set on the Player and I believe we will add other states in the future such as paused due to running out of video buffer.

So, for the time being I think it would make sense if we keep the play and pause methods, and then introduce the new state variable as a read only property. We're this still support most of your needs? It would still be fine to have a delegate method that can control whether or not the player can make certain state transitions, Although those state transitions would probably be initiated by a more direct method such as play or pause.

Another option is to introduce a different type of enumeration that has actions that can be set, and include play and pause in those

It looks pretty good to me, but I also don't extensively use video node.  In the worst case I think we could add an ASVideoNode+Beta.h and expose this there.  But ideally we can commit to a public API direction to allow developers to support building a play head / track that moves as the video plays.

The API intentionally does not provide access to the underlying cell, although there has actually not ever been a report from the community that has required access to the cell, so it would be very interesting to me if you have discovered a case where it is necessary.

I can reproduce this with the Kittens sample.
By glitch i mean a sudden frame drop.
Last, it might correlate with the simulator. Don't recall seeing it on a device.

I'll try to find a time to fix you guys with a new kittens sample. One that work against a variety of image disk sizes.
",ItamarM,appleguy
1480,2016-04-06 06:03:50,"@ItamarM ah, knowing it is a frame drop helps dramatically :).

For one thing, logging to the console is actually quite slow so this can easily cause frame drops.  Also the simulator has very poor graphics performance despite great CPU, so it can drop frames randomly.

Can you please retest on a device, and let me know what device type you're using? You can easily use QuickTime player to record a screen capture video of the device as well. I would be happy to review an Instruments Time Profiler trays of scrolling in your app and make a few quick recommendations for how you can optimize it.

If there is any element in your scrolling view that does not require user interaction, such as if the images do not need to be tapped on, you should enable the node.layerBacked = YES and will definitely notice performance improvements on older devices.  Equally important, make sure you are using the nodeBlockFor[Row/Item]...: API; this is very simple to use, just make sure that you access your data model using the index Path outside of the block, and then return a block that creates the cell node and provides it the data model.  This helps both loading performance to be further increased over UIKit, and scrolling performance, because the cell allocation then occurs concurrently on multiple background threads.

There is an example app already posted which has an infinite feed of large photographs, so this would be a perfect place to reproduce the issue you're describing if it continues to affect your app in a user-visible way (a device).  Check it out!  https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/1457

",appleguy,maicki
1477,2016-04-10 02:14:55,"@maicki I'm going to take this change now as it is definitely an important improvement compared to where we were before. However, there are a few important follow-ups, and please quickly review my comments to make sure that I did not forget to summarize any of them here.
- The transform logic being applied to the scroll direction is **very likely incorrect / should not be applied**, with potentially significant results.  We should check who originally added this.  If it was before my diffs that flipped / made consistent the definitions of Up, Down, etc...then the author probably thought it was necessary because of another bug, when it is in fact not needed and will cause problems like potentially no batch fetching or a flipped working range for transformed views.
- Coalescing should not schedule multilpe call to check the batch, if one is already pending.
- Remove additional logic around horizontal for tables
- Consider if batching should actually be skipped in the case of dragging, and if not, move the other check into the shared code
- **handle moving and reloading of both rows and sections** which can trigger the need to batch fetch.  While I will definitely accept / merge the diff by just adding additional calls, it might make sense to have a shared override point that does both the ""no animation"" call and the ""schedule check for batch update""

Could you include the rest of the setup code for these elements? For example, where do you set flexShrink = YES for the text nodes? Note the fact that this is often the desired behavior is why this PR is under consideration: https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/851

What version of the framework are you using, perhaps give me the hash? There have been some very significant recent changes to the layout system in just the past few days, so it is possible there is a bug in this situation. In the very near future however, properties such as flexShrink Will automatically propagate through their parents in a way that makes these use cases easier to get right.

I know it would be a bit tedious to do so, but if you can re-create a similar situation in any one of the example applications, It would provide an excellent ability for us to debug together and reach the right solution very quickly.

Is it some form of dataSource proxy that intercepts calls and forwards some of them? If so, it is very likely that it could be ignoring or improperly manipulating calls that are unique to ASDK or that ASDK expects to behave in a standard UIKit documented way. 

Do you have any screenshot or video example (even of another app) of the effect you would like to achieve?

The way this particular system is implemented is not up to the standard of the rest of the framework, but fortunately it should be pretty easy to improve and address this issue now that you have done the hard work of identifying it.

This will be a priority for the next release. as long as we can reproduce (necessary to be able to test).  If you have the time to do so, it would be helpful to try reproducing this in one of the many apps like examples/ASCollectionView that support pushing additional controllers to test lifecycle things such as this.

1459,2016-03-31 05:34:57,"@binchensjtu thanks for reporting this issue. What is an example of an application user interface that has this kind of access pattern? It seems likely that the clear fetch data call could occur slightly before the display call for the next item, or even before the next item is in the fetch data range, so fixing this specific case does not seem likely to address the overall issue with your application reusing images regularly.

That said, I believe the disk cash is intended to keep the information even in a situation like this. Which version of the framework are you using? Note that there were several improvements to the behavior of caching with 1.9.7.1 and 2.1.2.

1. There was a bug in PINRemoteImage, which has been fixed, which would _not_ store un-decoded images in the memory cache: https://github.com/pinterest/PINRemoteImage/pull/162/files
2. The line you pointed out in PINRemoteImage is meant to remove invalid items from the cache. I.e. ones that can't be instantiated as an image or animatedImage. It shouldn't be hit on a regular basis. I'd love to know repro steps if you are hitting it regularly.

The below log show that the same image is suddenly change from cache(`PINRemoteImageResultTypeMemoryCache` or `PINRemoteImageResultTypeCache`) to network (`PINRemoteImageResultTypeDownload`) 



You can reproduce this by change Kittens example.
1. Make KittenNode use one hard coded URL like `_imageNode.URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@""https://dn-meitiantest.qbox.me/pic.png""];`
2. Increase the kMaxLitterSize much larger in ViewController. like `static const NSInteger kMaxLitterSize = 10000;`

Overall, it is by far the cleanest _and_ most full-featured app in examples/ .  Really.  It is also the only app in examples/ with room to grow, both architecturally and in concept.  There's been a lot of iteration here, and I'm going to merge this initial diff because it has already served as a resource for the community & has no blockers.

It would be awesome to see continued work here.  Both the handful of cleanup areas mentioned (all more minor than the issues affecting every other app in examples/), but also additional features like perhaps viewing user profiles for 500px photographers with an ASCollectionView of their photos - and maybe use ASMapNode on a Location page, reusing the ASCollectionView of photos - perhaps wrapping up the example with opening / closing photos and using an ASPagerNode for fullscreen swiping?

If you use ASViewController to contain the user profile or other views, this example would be only one even close to engaging all four ASDisplayNode container types :)  cc @maicki @levi for thinking about developer intuitiveness / documentation, and how we may be able to leverage this code as an easy-to-read example for things like ""go check out X for an example of using implicit hierarchy management to resize a cell with -setNeedsLayout"".

As you can see, there are quite a few assertions in the CodeBase to detect a variety of different misunderstandings of the API or framework behavior, and it certainly fits within that in tent to add this one.

If you can think of an easy way to write this, Please put up a pull request and I would be happy to merge it. Typically, I would recommend strictly minimizing usage of this method (synchronous wrapping of custom views), and implementations that you do require should follow a functional style that minimizes its dependence on external state or view reuse.  I'd be interested to learn what use cases you have for it, though I'm sure they are prudent!

ASDK automatically spreads out do you creation cost through multiple rapid-fire turns of the runloop (many per frame), allowing touches and animations to get running time even if it is necessary to create or distribute. This makes a view reuse almost completely unnecessary, especially for the level of complexity and difficult bugs that it introduces in many apps.

If this is a significant issue, I can go with this approach in the next few days. However, this fundamentally seems like a limitation with Cocoapods, and specifically dynamic frameworks, which have some pretty serious performance problems by themselves.

Please take a look at the issue I filed with the project that I believe is still unresolved. It results in massive memory consumption that will cause most applications to crash within minutes.

The latest version of the framework should support all your requirements by simply doing alloc/init on the network image node.  It is fully integrated with PINRemoteImage.

This provides many advantages, including automatic prioritization of network requests that increases as the image gets closer to the screen or becomes visible, in three distinct levels of priority it also efficiently handles memory, and transparently manages a 50MB (configurable) image disk cache that is very effective.

Please let me know if you have the opportunity to try this out, especially since it should only require deleting code from your application. It would be very helpful to know if there are any inconveniences in the adoption, or negative behaviors that are not optimal for your application.

The manual handling of the fade will be unnecessary with this approach, as a properly working cash will provide Image loading and also display nearly always before the image is in the visible area. Because of that, you can rely entirely on placeholderImage (subclass networkimagenode and override) and placeholderFadesoOut -- we use this option very extensively and it is well tested in complex, varying circumstances.

It wasn't clear that `ASNetworkImageNode` had any caching going on when I tested it. Odd. That was the only reason I went out of my way to find a cache, and went for something familiar — a bridge to SDWebImage.

EDIT: Ah! `ASNetworkImageNode` learns of the existence of PINRemoteImage via a compiler flag... I'm using Carthage. Will need to set this myself.

EDIT: #1464 Carthage users need to use `ASPINRemoteImageDownloader` in a much more explicit way

@EviluS has the right idea here. Drawing the shadow in a more manual way would significantly help. The way that the Paper app achieves these effects is to use thin, stretchable images for each side of the shadow effect (these elements can be layer backed or sometimes even rasterized). 

A final thing you should consider is if the UI behavior should be tweaked depending on the performance of a device. For example, the second most expensive thing here is the fade in animations as images load.

1444,2016-03-28 04:40:13,"@akathrowaway thank you for the detailed post. I have some important things to finish tonight and have not yet had a chance to fully understand all of the details here, but I definitely will do so at my soonest opportunity and really appreciate you taking the time to include the detail.

This framework is not widely tested for usage of nodes outside of some form of container / root element.  the reason is simple... in this configuration, there is no system that will trigger the asynchronous layout for display in advance of the content coming on screen, which essentially guarantees that content will ""flash"".

Could you explain a use case, or an example project that demonstrates one, whether one of the many projects in examples/ (feel free to modify one) or one that you create, that exhibits any inconvenient behavior when using ASCellNode with Table, Collection, or Pager - or using an ASViewController?  Also, I assume you're using the latest version of the framework?

These root container objects handled the responsibility of calling measure, as well as triggering display and proactively managing memory. Feel free to check out the description of these components in the NSSpain talk (sorry it's not the greatest - more docs on the way soon, @lappp9 would you be okay with linking your current version of the first tutorial here?)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY_X7l1g79Q

Anyway, the layout system of this framework is the most different aspect of its design from UIKit, although it is also tightly integrated. I have not actually encountered a case yet (from anyone in the community) that describes the resizing behavior as inconvenient, but this only increases my interest in understanding the use cases where it is problematic, and ensuring that this is not simply due to incomplete adoption of the framework such is lacking a root element. For example, when using a cell node, it is typically extremely convenient to be able to call setNeedsLayout and rely on the overall cell changing height automatically - even inside a table or collection.

It is even customizable whether those layouts should be performed in an animated or non-animated way, And it is also possible to write your layout in such a way that it does not rely on the size of its subnodes to determine its height, So as far as I'm aware of there is complete control over the behavior you want.

All this said, I want to reiterate that the layout system that has been in the framework and widely used for the past nine months is still a very poorly documented despite its high degree of testing and flexibility, which makes it almost impossible to jump into and completely understand the conventions and capabilities. This is one reason why I am so active in the Community and try to help everyone understand the best way to get a lot out of the framework, and why am looking forward to the documentation projects that members of the community have been willing to advance. It is now higher priority for me as certain critical projects in my day job are wrapping up.  I'm sorry for the trouble in understanding this stuff and hope to be able to help.

1444,2016-03-28 06:13:08,"@appleguy thanks for response!

i just completed experimenting w/ ASViewController and did bunch of debugging;
1. ASViewController seems to be invoking [node measureWithSizeRange] in viewWillLayoutSubviews based on stack-trace. and this ends up masking the issue 3 because it's actually the same ""work-around"" i mentioned above:

> d. if i invoke [myNode measure:] right before [myNode setNeedsLayout] to workaround above issue, [setNeedsLayout] throws away my measure and re-invokes measure.. so... why should i call [measure] myself first if it's going to be thrown away?

so it ""fixes"" it the same way, but with the same wasteful `[measure]` call... 
1. root-node resizing logic from `setNeedsLayout` would be skipped because ASViewController passed in a sizeRange whose minSizeRange is the screen-size; so it would never clamp below the screen size... 

and that re-sizing logic would only apply to root-node, but ASViewController is basically preventing root-node from being re-sized; so that resizing-logic would be a dead-code (assuming no-rotation) while using ASViewController... i guess that logic exists for ASCollection/TableView? 

in summary, all the custom logics related to resizing in `[node setNeedsLayout]` becomes no-op while using ASViewController (its own root node), so it doesn't affect that view controller, but if one's using a UIViewController, it would/ and bunch of indeterministic behavior described above... and the way to skip that custom logic is either directly call `[node.view setNeedsLayout]` or keep calling `measureWithSizeRange` in viewWillLayoutSubviews (like ASViewController does) which would be more expensive. and since that custom logic is not benefitting ASViewController... and it doesn't really benefit regular UIViewController users either... then i guess there were some other cases (ASTableVC?) that benefitted from this.... i feel like those custom `[setNeedsLayout]` behaviors should've been inside their respective benefactors' node classes instead of ASDisplayNode...but okie; at least, i know how to work-around it.

thanks for response again!

1444,2016-04-06 02:36:03,"@akathrowaway I appreciate all the detail you provided in your report. Could you quickly synthesize it into a modification to anyone of our example projects, or post a new example project that reproduces the issue? If the issue is as broad as your description seems to indicate, I would hope that it is not too difficult to create a reproduction. I wish I could do this myself but am necessarily focused on the application rollout and some other competing priorities—but if you were able to create the example I should be able to create a resolution for you within a small number of days.

I don't believe it is accurate that any of the behavior is specifically customized for one use case, as we are successfully using the framework for a very wide variety of implementation requirements (everything the Pinterest app supports) — and there have been no other reports to my knowledge of having issues in this area.  My hope is that the answer is a quick fix for you, although it is also very possible that there is a quick improvement to the framework behavior that we can make. It should definitely not be required to have a wasteful call to -measure:.

1444,2016-11-18 22:31:22,"@akathrowaway Can you check that this still exists after #2597?
",garrettmoon,akathrowaway
1444,2016-11-23 00:52:16,"@akathrowaway 

With the changes within #2597 our main goal was to align the `setNeedsLayout` more with the UIKit behavior, but to not break the backwards behavior we had in place if node's are within a node container. Furthermore we also would like to support just setting the frame to a node and the node will automatically layout itself based on the frame set on it.

I think the problems and key changes are all listed in #2597 and should address most of the issues you listed above, but just quickly speak a bit about the main question what the expection is for `setNeedsLayout`:

Calling `setNeedsLayout` should behave the same way as in UIKit now. It just invalidates the layout of the node and does nothing else. You can even call it a couple of times and it will not immediately layout the node or resize it as it was the case before. If then the next layout pass in UIKit happens, UIKit will call `layoutSublayers` on the node's layer and this eventually calls `layout` on the node. Within layout the node, based on certain circumstances, decides to use a constrained size and a layout pass of the node will happen.

That said one side effect still exists if you use nodes in containers (`ASCellNode`, `ASTableNode`, `ASCollectionNode`, `ASPagerNode` etc.). If a size changes in a subnode it will automatically call up the root node and it re-layout based on the new size of the subnode. A good example is ASDKGram where we download further data from the network and if this data arrives we show certain nodes that where hidden before and call `setNeedsLayout` on the node that determines that the size of itself changes and tells the root node container about it (in this case the `ASCellNode`). The `ASCellNode` uses this information now to relayout itself based on the new information and a height adjustment animation for this `ASCellNode` will happen.
This behavior is only used if you use a container node though. If you set your bounds manually the node will use this size to layout itself.

I will close that issue, please reopen in case you have further questions or you think it's not clear enough. Please also not hesitate to come into our Slack channel to ask further questions or have a discussion around it, happy to help!",maicki,akathrowaway

1439,2016-03-26 19:42:52,"@anhnd thank you for the quick reply. This issue should be solvable, and I believe is caused by containing your text nodes within a view rather than in a node hierarchy. And example of An issue that can occur with this is that if you do not retain the text node objects directly and rely on the view hierarchy to retain them, if the view controller undergoes a transition for certain other instances, it can cause the node object to be deallocated.

If it is appropriate for the layout of the application, one good solution is to use either a table or collection view.  Otherwise, you should use an ASViewController, with a containing node that holds the other elements. If you still need to use UIViews, this is fine.  You can always add them _in -didLoad, not -init_ to the self.view if you're implementing a node subclass, for example the containing node..

1438,2016-03-26 18:56:56,"@Adlai-Holler this is an intensely performance sensitive method. I can't immediately think of a use case for changing the layer hierarchy in response to a display call... This method will in fact not even call layout, because that has already occurred shortly before we start the iteration.

Could you share a stack trace for examples of how this enumeration exception can be triggered with a user-interface code pattern that should be supported?

1438,2016-04-20 03:10:48,"@Adlai-Holler if I can get some details on the stack trace, Or better yet a reproduction case, I'm not opposed to taking this. However, this is a performance critical code path on the main thread and I would like to ensure I understand a plausible scenario in which this would be required.

For example, with the display node call backs for custom drawing, they must be done in a class method and they are called off of main thread entirely. So it doesn't seem like a valid thing to change the layer hierarchy at that time, And the correct fix for a place holder manipulating the hierarchy is more likely adjusting that call rather than copying the tree.
",appleguy,Adlai-Holler
1438,2016-06-05 04:18:26,"@Adlai-Holler I finally encountered this for the first time.  It is due to some code I would consider incorrect, an outdated manual call to -fetchData that itself triggers adding something to the hierarchy, all triggered by displayWillStart.  That said, all I really wanted before adding this overhead is a concrete stack trace of an example of hitting the issue, and now we have that :).

I'll take this for now, but it would be great to eventually allow deferring displayWillStart just momentarily, until after the iteration, to avoid this high frequency copy -- for the fact that many apps have huge hierarchies and this will happen thousands of times while scrolling.

1431,2016-03-26 19:22:45,"@wy19901227 thank you for filing this issue. Is a good suggestion to automatically leave out children in a stack that are marked as hidden.  Was not aware that the new IOS 9 stack component has similar behavior.

For now, there is a good way to accomplish this. We are going to enabled by default (soon / before 2.0) a new framework feature called implicit hierarchy management. You can turn this on for your own node now, and it allows controlling the children in a stack automatically based on what you would turn in the layout spec.

It does not look at the hidden property, but rather automatically adds or removes sub nodes for you according to what is actually in the layout specification.
",appleguy,wy19901227
1431,2016-03-26 19:32:35,"@wy19901227 - To enable implicit hierarchy management, do the following 3 things:
- `#import ""ASDisplayNode+Beta.h""`
- add `self.usesImplicitHierarchyManagement = YES;` to your `init:` method
- any `addSubnode:` calls are no longer needed when using this option, unless you need to manually position the node in `layout` and cannot include the node in `layoutSpecThatFits:`
- to add and remove an element from the stack, simply call `[self setNeedsLayout]` (which will cause `layoutSpecThatFits:` to be called again) and set the children of the stack appropriately

The file below demonstrates this. `_playgroundNode` is added using implicitHierarchyManagement (no call to `addSubnode:`) while `_resizeHandle` is manually laid out in `layout` and so requires a call to `addSubnode:`

ASLayoutSpecs are relatively new and it looks like `ASOverlayLayoutSpec` isn't yet configured to override the order in which you call `addSubnode:`  This is definitely a bug.

Here are several ways to get around this until the bug is fixed:
- use `zPosition` as you have done. Just a warning: zPosition will not affect event handling, so it's okay if you don't have touches, but if you do have touches, don't use it. 
- use `addSubnode:` in the correct order (`_recipeImageNode` and then `_avatarImageNode`)
- use [self.view bringSubviewToFront:_avatarImageNode.view];

1425,2016-03-27 17:57:01,"@hannahmbanana Great tips! I'm used thinking about UI in a declarative way and forgot that UIKit cares very much what order children are placed.

Hmmm. Though thinking about it, should `ASOverlayLayout` really be manipulating the ordering of `subnodes` array?  Sounds like it might be doing a bit too much. `ASBackgroundLayout` would also require the same behaviour.

What might be more useful is if the layout could spit out a warning, saying that ""ASDK is trying to overlay A over B but node B is before A in pecking order. This will cause A to appear beneath B (given they have identical `zPosition`). Make sure you have [self addSubnode:A] before [self addSubnode:B]. "".

When Implicit Node Hierarchy Management becomes default (it is currently beta), adding SubNodes will be used almost exclusively for manually overriding the default ordering of the nodes that is defined in the layoutSpec.

1422,2016-03-24 21:13:39,"@runningfree100 can you use QuickTime to take a screen capture of the simulator, or take a video of your device with this issue?

Would you say that the actual behavior is stretching the previous text when you're updating it, rather than it being a blurry version of the correct text?

One way that you can avoid this problem is to use placeholders (e.g. placeholderImage) so that in the time where the new taxes rendering, it shows a blank area temporarily.  You might have to set textNode.contents = nil, which will ensure it goes into the placeholder state briefly.

Another way is that you can avoid sending the new frame on the existing text node until the new one is done rendering.  We could better support this and the framework, but for now, you would probably have to create a second text node - you can put it in a hierarchy and mark it isHidden = YES, then wait for the displayFinished call.  At that point you can immediately remove the old text node and make the new one visible

Lastly, a third way that is probably the easiest solution for you right now is to call recursivelyEnsureDisplaySynchronously:YES on the text node after you have updated the text.  If you were changing the tax of several items in the same node hierarchy, you can call this on the higher level node, and it will even perform the rendering concurrently on multiple background threads to reduce the time that the main thread is blocked.

Thanks for reporting this, as it reminds me that we could integrate better support for this case being fully asynchronous in the framework.

I would significantly prefer if we can use a non-retaining, efficient data structure.  A simple C-array (getBytes from the NSArray copied into a malloc'd memory area?) would be a lot better, if it is safe... Although it does seem at least conceivable that some transformation triggered by one of the elements could actually result in before the allocation of one of the other objects (seems pretty shady to do, but maybe a subnode calling to a supernode via a delegate, and triggering rasterization enable could technically orphan all of the references to a given sublayer of a sibling node?)

Basically I'm using an ASPagerNode to display 3 viewcontrollers that I have, pretty standard stuff. Nodes for the viewcontrollers are created using the `pagerNode(pagerNode: ASPagerNode!, nodeBlockAtIndex index: Int)` and everything works fine. 

The problem I'm having is not related to the elements in those views because I use them like you mentioned. One of the views have an editabletextnode in them, and I wanted to use `touchesBegan(touches: Set<UITouch>, withEvent event: UIEvent?)` on its parent node to dismiss the keyboard if the textnode has focus, but the method is never called.

You may need to run pod update to get the latest version of AsyncDisplayKit, as newer versions of CocoaPods require this. 

As for your question: To detect a tap, you should either add a tap gesture recognizer to the `ASCellNode` in `didLoad:` (_not_ in `init:`) or add an `ASControlNode` that is as large as the area you need to tap with an `addTarget:action:` call. 

Because your sample project was mostly empty, your current hierarchy seemed to have elements that weren't used or weren't necessary for the functionality of the sample project.

It's not very clear to me why you would want touchesBegan on the pager node, because just like in a collection view in UIKit, the content inside the cells would normally block the touches from reaching that point.  Also touchesBegan should never be used directly to detect taps; a tap is not considered recognized until the touch lifts, and without too much distance in the finger moving.

1417,2016-03-24 04:19:49,"@wy19901227 - thanks for your question! I believe this is the correct behavior for the current implementation of the sample app. 

ASTextNode (like all ASControlNodes - including ASImageNode, ASButtonNode, ASTextNode) have `userInteractionEnabled = NO` by default. This is the same default behavior as UIImageView and UILabel, which also have user interaction disabled by default. This is why the avatar image view, username, post time, etc pass touches through to the ASCellNode, allowing cell selection. If you message `addTarget:action:` to any ASControlNode, it will automatically enable user interaction, which is why you might not have had to explicitly set `userInteractionEnabled = YES` for any nodes before.

When you have text that may contains links, this by default enables user interaction for an ASTextNode, thereby the ASTextNode will capture the touches and so the ASCellNode will receive them. This is why the center text paragraph (""normal words"") captures the touch and does not pass touches.

HOWEVER, ASTextNode offers touch pass through for textNodes that have links but want to avoid capturing a touch unless the touch is on a link. To fix the sample app, you can add the following line to PostNode's init method:   `_postNode.passthroughNonlinkTouches = YES;`

That said, speaking with a few coworkers today, they pointed out that the scope of possible states are not all things that should be possible for a developer to set. For example, when playing is finished, this is not necessarily a state that should be available to set on the Player and I believe we will add other states in the future such as paused due to running out of video buffer.

So, for the time being I think it would make sense if we keep the play and pause methods, and then introduce the new state variable as a read only property. We're this still support most of your needs? It would still be fine to have a delegate method that can control whether or not the player can make certain state transitions, Although those state transitions would probably be initiated by a more direct method such as play or pause.

Another option is to introduce a different type of enumeration that has actions that can be set, and include play and pause in those

For obvious reasons, especially considering that the API is thread safe and that the measurement calculations can be easily performed on a background thread simply by calling transition there, it is important to ensure consistency. 

If you could elaborate on your use case, which is probably valid and worth supporting, we can think about the way to support it. The architecture in this area is actually in great shape to modify this behavior, potentially doing something like allowing a subtree that is animating to take precedence over animations of the parent, but we will need to think through certain threading implications.

1396,2016-04-01 06:33:19,"@eanagel - a new internal capability called ASEnvironment has landed and one of its functions is to propagate the ASLayoutable properties up the tree. This should eliminate the need to set something like flexShrink on an insetSpec if it contains a textNode that already has flexShrink set. 

It would be really valuable if you could test this out and see if it allows you to simplify any of your layout code as well as if it causes any unexpected issues. There is some possibility that this could cause regressions, but because the framework has not gone to 2.0 yet, this would be acceptable if the resulting layout code, after fixing the issue, is simpler than before.

Animating other properties that did not change the frame were working, for instance if I was just animating the alpha of new nodes. 

And here is a sample app to demonstrate the issue. Whats happening is the animated node will jump to its final position immediately after starting the animation.

Basically, I want a `UIScrollView` to behave just like it does with a regular `UIButton` inside a table view cell. When you touch down on the button and start moving the finger around, the button is tracking the touches, but the scroll view doesn't scroll during this tracking.

Judging from the linked SO answer (and verified in practice), `UIScrollView` distinguishes between `UIControl`s and other `UIView`s when handling such situations. To replicate this behavior, a way to get a node, if any, from an arbitrary view  is necessary, and, in my opinion, `ASViewToDisplayNode()` does the job perfectly.

1368,2016-03-17 18:15:19,"@wpK Looking at your example code, I have a few questions / things to note.

First to try and answer your question. Are you just trying to get calculateSizeThatFits on your textNode to be called with a size who's width is bounded by the width of the vStack? If this is the case, you can set textNode.flexBasis = ASRelativeDimensionMakeWithPercent(1) on your textNode, this will make sure it's calculateSizeThatFits method is called with a size that has a bounded width, which in your case is 164 (180 - the edge inset you have).

Now if you are looking to have calculateSizeThatFits called with something smaller, you'll just need to adjust the percentage on the flexBasis value. Setting it to 0.5 would give you something like this:

To get rid of the overflow you'd have to set your hStack to have flexShrink = true which would end up looking like this:

![screen shot 2016-03-17 at 11 08 57 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1269011/13856061/b24d1bc2-ec30-11e5-9ea1-783ccb6d73ef.png)

However from reading your question it seems like you want something like this but with the entire layout to still take up your measuring size of CGSizeMake(180, 142), if this is the case you'll need to call measureWithSizeRange and supply a min size, otherwise calling measure will just use size zero as the min. 

So instead of calling, self.containerNode.measure(CGSizeMake(180, 142)) call, self.containerNode.measureWithSizeRange(ASSizeRangeMakeExactSize(CGSizeMake(180, 142)))

![screen shot 2016-03-17 at 11 03 09 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1269011/13855918/dd1cc164-ec2f-11e5-9226-e461dbb1f335.png)

However if you had multiple children layouts in your hStack using 1 as the percent might not be what you'd want, you might just have to use the correct percent you want for each child.

is this along the lines of what you're looking for?

I think my question and code sample was way too bloated and confusing. I'm trying to get the vStack to shrink to the width of the hStack and the hStack to shrink to the width of the textNode.

1368,2016-05-02 17:13:36,"@maicki The static layout was my mistake from trying other layouts types before posting. Thanks for pointing that out.

I could work on creating a better example. A perfect example is the Pinterest chat bubbles. Do you think it would be possible to get the same behavior with AsyncDisplayKit using the ASLayoutSpec?

When the text node is initially offered an infinite width by the hstack, it returns back a size too large for hstack, so hstack then passes a new size to the text node, in which the the text node returns back a new size that fits within the hstack. The issue is, because the hstack already has it's width set, it ends up being bigger.

I'm not 100% sure that there is any simple solution using ASLayoutSpec. If the layout system did what I want, then the hstack would then see it needs to get smaller, and then the parent will have more room which would require another layout, which in return could cause more layouts potentially causing an infinite loop.

Thanks again everybody for your help. I haven't had time to work with it again but with all the activity here I think I'll give it another go.

1367,2016-03-17 04:41:53,"@binl thank you for proposing this. You definitely discovered a real, important issue that was caused by very recent changes related to triggering range updates upon a table / collection moving into or out of a window. In addition to the memory footprint, this was causing back to back calls to visibilityDidChange: separated by just one run loop turn, and although the state always ended up correct, this extra thrash was both inefficient and potentially a problem for certain implementations that might not check to filter out noisy calls.

I feel it is very important to continue to observe this behavior to ensure that we are addressing any root causes of these kind of unnecessary calls, and believe that the system is now behaving in a significantly more calm and efficient way after https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/1382 .  If we find more causes, we should revisit to see if they have as concrete of a solution as was possible in that change.

That said, I would not be to surprise if we end up reopening this change and going in this direction. Overall, the range mode API is very new and Will not B production API for at least another month, possibly more. So we do have sometime to continue to inspect the behavior of the system in a variety of complex circumstances, and this change should continue to apply smoothly if we reopen the PR (no need to create a new one since it's so easy to reopen).

Give the new behavior a try, and let me know which scenarios are still producing noisy calls. I am nearly certain that there are at least a handful of cases that do so, potentially with very significant negative impact, and would be very motivated to start digging into why they happen.

Lastly, I am thrilled to see this new pull request from @hannahmbanana - it allows it visualizing the current range controllers in the system, which will dramatically assist in detecting these kind of problems. It is still a fairly rough implementation, but already amazingly useful, and can be expanded and improved as we learn which capabilities are most valuable.  https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/1390

1364,2016-03-12 06:30:05,"@levi thanks!  I will take this one - though ironically it exposes a flaw, which is that I have normally named statics and class methods with __ as well, along with the things that I want to avoid collisions with reasonably-named internal versions (e.g. people who might have a _layout so they can call it manually in an animation).  There is no meaningful collision risk here and we should start getting towards an actual, written-down code style (fortunately most of the style is adhered to in 90%+ the codebase, but DEFINITELY not underscore usage where there are some trends but many inconsistencies)
",appleguy,levi
1362,2016-04-07 07:11:56,"@tomizimobile - this is a great find and I think your analysis is correct. Do you have any current ideas on how we might fix this? I believe it is probably affecting a few other areas as the function you mentioned is used elsewhere. 

Note that there is very large memory cost to making even a single color image full-size rather than stretchable, so you might consider using -placeholderImage (you have to subclass a node and override this method to return the placeholderImage). This uses a separate placeholder layer and does wait for the image to load from the network. You probably want this behavior anyways as it will decode synchronously as defaultImage is asynchronous. 

The main benefit of defaultImage is that it will remain visible even if no URL is set or if the image load fails. This is not the intended use of the placeholder, which will only exist during loading or decoding. But it should not be difficult to catch this case and show a default profile picture or whatever. 
",appleguy,tomizimobile
1362,2016-04-07 13:43:15,"@appleguy The only idea to fix this that I have right now is what I mentioned above - to use another variable in `ASImageNode` to track changes in `contentMode`, and apply it in `setImage:`. I'm not sure what other things that might affect though, or what the performance impact would be - I'm sure there's optimizations to be made there. Unfortunately I don't have enough time to try out any fixes at the moment.

I was using a small, single color image along with the `contentMode` to stretch it rather than using a full-size image, although I'm not sure of the memory cost of that vs. stretchable images. I decided to use `defaultImage` so I wouldn't have to worry about what happens when the image load fails, but I definitely see the advantage now to using `placeholderImage` and handling the error case separately - thanks for the tip.

",appleguy,gazreese
1323,2016-04-01 06:24:30,"@gazreese it looks like this is almost ready to merge. My main concern at this point is the breaking API change, so let me know your intention with this and whether it would be appropriate to continue to support a setter method for the asset even if the init methods remain.

It does seem possible to me that a user may want to create a video node and display a placeholder using a traditional image, potentially before enough information has learned from the network to actually create the video asset. This may be an edge case, but it is not clear to me that we should avoid supporting it in the API. That said, there are other positive aspects to change such as not requiring support for the various state updates that have to occur if the asset were to change. We should decide what the appropriate API functionality is based on the total set of reasonable use cases, and then worry about the implementation.

If you could also rebase this one more time, I will push too have it merged soon so that further re-bases are unlikely to be required.

Lastly, have you been using this regularly in your own application and found it to be reliable? With large changes of this nature, regression testing is always a primary concern, especially when there are not many Active clients who can immediately help test the new functionality. The video node has become relatively popular though, so my main concern is regression / alteration in its previous behaviors
",appleguy,gazreese
1323,2016-04-01 18:31:02,"@gazreese thanks for the super quick reply. It sounds like you're well aware, but just a heads-up, make sure you set the tuning parameters for any a table or collection views that you use to reduce the ""fetch data"" range if your application is particularly sensitive to Data consumption.

For the time being, let's keep the writable property and add a simple assertion if you can Think of the right spot to do this. I think the main reason is that unlike the underlying player item, which there is no use case to desire creating before something like a URL is available, there is the use case for a developer to create a video node potentially before they have a reference to the underlying video. This is a rare use case, and the most important concern at this point is that apps would need to change how they use video nodes to update the framework after this change otherwise.

Let me know if you have any further thoughts or questions, and no worries if you are not able to finish this work. Just leave a comment here to that effect if things get busy for you.

Specifically, if I have a simple Podfile to include AsyncDisplayKit 1.9.7 then there is no issue. However, I have separate target definitions in my [Podfile](https://github.com/martin-gearzero/asdk-1309/blob/master/Podfile) because I only need a subset of pods in my sharing extension.

I'm afraid I'm not too familiar with the inner workings of CocoaPods so I'm not sure how to proceed at this point. Is this something which needs to be fixed with ASDK/PINCache or is it a limitation of CocoaPods? Or perhaps it simply a misconfiguration in my project?

",appleguy,yxztj
1295,2016-03-02 01:58:34,"@appleguy Thanks for the quick reply.
I was trying to repro the issue using fewer lines, so I didn't set any font attributes for the label and text node. Guess it's the default behavior?
",yxztj,appleguy

I would expect it to use ... by default, but would be interested to know if even that is insufficient.  I suspect this is caused only by truncations triggered by maximum line cap, rather than a size constraint.

Since we are in the final 2 week push for the Pinterest app rewrite, and then have stabilization work after that, it'll be tough for me to test around with this for a while.  If you have the time, the other thing to try is removing the numberOfLines max - and just provide a constrained height that is short enough to cause it.  Then, the ... will probably occur automatically?

1295,2016-03-27 00:11:00,"@yxztj I have your test case running. It i does appear that there have been changes in behavior here, And that it may be an interaction between maximum number of lines and the case of a string ending with a newline.

I have ported your example to Objective-C, because some of the intermediate Versions of the framework had an issue where it would not build with swift. I'm going to check in this example so that other members of the community can assist in debugging this.

For one thing, you are creating and attributed string without a font or font size. This may result in a difference in default size, so it is always best to be explicit and specify a size.

Is the bug you were observing only caused by extra newlines after text, if those new lines have no visible characters on them? It is possible that these are being filtered out at some stage, and we can investigate why that is the case if true
",appleguy,yxztj
1295,2016-03-27 00:56:13,"@yxztj I have found to separate resolutions to the issue:
1. if you call measure: on the node before it is able to display, which is normally the case when a node is used in real real application as part of a layout spec or a correct implementation of the 1.x calculateSize...: method, AND provide a constrainedSize that matches the number of lines that it is expected to display, it will truncate properly even if the frame provided is larger. That is to say, it looks like if measure is not called or is called with a value greater than the equivalent number of max lines, it the layout calculation triggered at display-time may be using the taller value of the frame and not trigger creation of the truncation string until a later stage applies the maximum number of lines -- which may be too late
2. if you reduce the height of the frame by half, then even without the measure call, truncation is shown correctly.

So the bug appears to be specific to 1) using a maximum number of lines and that being the reason that a string truncates rather than the available height, 2) not calling measure or calling measure with a size that is greater than the true desired maximum height by exceeding the height of the maximum number of lines, and 3) also providing a frame that is taller than the maximum number of lines.

The good news is that it is undesirable to create this situation in a real application, because it results in a larger Display backing store which uses more memory and create additional compositing cost. This is equally true for UILabel - Apps should always minimize the size of their views.

Although this is a fairly extreme edge case, it is definitely a bug and deserves to be fixed. However, I hope you're able to employ one of these workarounds and continue using the latest version of the framework, because the degree of improvement in the overall framework achieved since the last version quite remarkable… I believe there are over 700 commits, and incredible performance improvements from the new ASRunloopQueue.

Thanks again for helping Report and communicate the details of this issue. I really appreciate it, as it would have been hard to discover otherwise, and it definitely does contribute to the community building one of the most advanced text engines on the platform.
",appleguy,yxztj
1295,2016-03-27 01:24:35,"@yxztj despite the relatively low priority, this one was bothering me, and so I investigated further and came up with what I am confident is the correct fix.

https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/1440

Please try it out, and definitely continue to report any issues of this nature. Even if an extreme edge case, I really do want to make sure that every scenario works. I would highly recommend however that you start using ASViewController with a containing node, or a table / Collection with ASCellNodes.  You can either use the layout spec that fits method, or calculate size that fits, but this framework does expect that Measure is called on nodes before they are displayed.

If you use layout specs, Measure is called completely automatically. If you use calculate size that fits, the API contract is that you called measure on each of your subnodes, because providing the argument a constrained size is something that the framework is not able to do unless it has information about the desired layout.

Yes definitely would report any issue we encountered after narrowing down as much as we can. We'd be happy to contribute, but due to complexity of the framework, we haven't been able to read the code through and dig deep of what's behind the scene, so sometimes we could just create a demo for repro issues without getting closer to root cause. 

There are some tutorials about how to use ASDK(and basic principles of how ""async"" is playing its role here), but not much how it works step by step. Hope we can get more articles/documents to help understand the framework. :)

1265,2016-02-24 15:52:59,"@appleguy What appeared to be happening to me was that ASTextNode would create a renderer to compute the text size. In the process the renderer would also determine our scale factor. Upon completion, I would save this scale factor away in ASTextNode.  ASTextNode then invalidated (dealloc'ed) the renderer. 

After this `setAttributedString` on ASTextNode was being called, in which I would clear out the saved scale factor. ASTextNode would then create a new renderer with the current scale factor (which was just cleared) to actually draw the text. This renderer was never used to calculate size, so it never updated the scale factor it was created with. By putting the scale computation in both places I ensured that this didn't happen.

TBH, the behavior seems strange to me. Let me describe the situation where I'm seeing this. I have a button that changes text when selected. After I change the `attributedString` on the ASTextNode I never see a text renderer with the new string in `_calculateSize` or `size`. The renderer does have the new string in `drawInContext:bounds:`.

Enabling it doesn't inherently animate the relayout, but prevents ASDK from performing the mass frame calculation of each cell in the data source in the `ASPerformWithoutAnimation` block—which is a bug. When rotating the device or even resizing the app size in split view multitasking, this relayout will be performed within a system animation block and ASDK is currently preventing the cells from animating their layout in that CATransaction.

I think this is a much more important issue than just the pager implementation, because we are passing an index Path here and so there is a data model consistency issue just as there would be if we requested actual nodes in this way.

I think it is rare in practice for developers to have an implementation of this method where this is a critical problem, but for those who do, it could result in a pretty serious issue.  @nguyenhuy is currently working on a fix, but we will see if it gets into the next release. I have a pull request up that Restore is the behavior of previous versions of the framework, but it does not fix this particular issue.

I agree with you that we can change the minimum value to be the same as the maximum so that the page size is by default guaranteed to match the bound size.

1243,2016-03-15 22:20:41,"TL,DR: @appleguy The black background is the result of an unexpected `isOpaque` value to be YES instead of NO.

I'm sharing the results of my investigation so far:

In ASImageNode.mm, `drawParametersForAsyncLayer:` will use `self.opaque` to define the value that will be used to actually create the context in `displayWithParameters:isCancelled:`

On an ImageNode, by default opaque is NO (defined in `init`, and it seems that there is a TODO regarding this block of code) so if you display a PNG with alpha, it will actually be rendered correctly without doing anything.

I notice the black background issue on scrolling up & down in an ASTableView, so I wonder if there is something related to ASRangeController.

Anyway, at some point the layer will have an opaque value set to YES, and so will lead to the black background issue.
I couldn't find yet what was triggering that change in the layer (again might be related to ASRangeController cleaning up things).

I also notice that **setting a backgroundColor prevents the change** on isOpaque from NO to YES. (Even if the background color is clearColor). That may be pure luck or that might ring a bell to you!

I'll continue to investigate in the following days, let me know if you think of something that might be related to what I observed,

If you need the height of the parent then you can set `horizontalStack.flexBasis = ASRelativeDimensionMakeWithPercent(1)`  (The percent range is from 0 to 1, which corresponds to 0% to 100%) which will then pass (width = Inf, height = parent's height).

If you then want to scale your subnodes relative to the parent's width (i.e not using Inf) then just set `child.flexBasis = ASRelativeDimensionMakeWithPercent(0.25)` on each subnode and that will give you a correct size for  `calculateSizeThatFits` :)

If this is the case is there property that can limit this? Seems like there should be something equivalent to flexBasis for the direction of the stack? Since flex basis only controls the cross axis. 

Or after thinking about it maybe, i'm just using the wrong combo of stack layouts. I'm trying to get my nodes to layout in a grid (see image). But I could just as well use 2 vertical stacks inside an other vertical stack where the 2 substacks have a flexBasis of 0.5. instead of rows I can work with columns...

**Layout Transition API Overview**
The Layout Transition API is designed this API to make all animations with AsyncDisplayKit easy - even transforming an entire set of views into a completely different set of views!

With this system, you simply specify the desired layout and AsyncDisplayKit will do the work to figure out differences from the current layout. It will automatically and new elements, remove unneeded elements after the transiton and update the position of any existing elements.

There are also easy to use APIs that allow you to fully customize the starting position of newly introduced elements, as well as the ending position of removed elements.

We have some pretty extensive usage of the framework at Pinterest, in at least 20 quite complex views, and we also do things like diffing model object responses to break into UIKit edit operations.

However, clearly we may not quite be triggering something that otherwise could very easily be hit, and indeed may not have quite as sophisticated and architecture in this area as your app does.

1208,2016-02-10 10:14:58,"@appleguy As for revisions, the last revision I tested (I'm going to test your fix now but I haven't pulled yet) is cae47e23e1697d9da317743783c4bd02a4e60d99 and the first commit that I pulled that this started happening was de2d3ab024fb683142d06779e5acc964162db5ea which I upgraded to from f696eb74769188f5dacafe178d458ce447e19fac.  However it was intermittent then (whereas in cae47e23e1697d9da317743783c4bd02a4e60d99 it is 100% reproducible with no relevant changes in my code) so there is a possibility that this ""break"" was introduced earlier.  
",smyrgl,appleguy
1208,2016-02-10 10:22:40,"@appleguy So I pulled 4c1654673af1ac9a8b2fa1eb140450df10006415 and I can confirm that this deadlock is no longer occurring.  It looks like the only change you did was to not use the lock if the thread is main...this fixes the issue (since the changesets can only be called from main due to the thread affinity asserts) but I'm not sure why it was happening in the first place.  I'm not complaining but even your documentation for the change only suggests that this is an optimization.

Anyway I will let you know if this reoccurs but if you know what the root cause is that would be helpful to understand.
",smyrgl,appleguy
1208,2016-02-10 10:27:31,"@appleguy As for the architecture of my app, I think it might make sense to take that to iMessage so we can have some back and forth on the subject.  The particular collection view that this triggered on is by far the most complex in the app (using extensive use of sections to represent flattened leaves of a tree data structure) but I'm not sure any of that is relevant to why this happened.  I emailed you my iMessage info, ping me at your convenience and we can discuss it further.
",smyrgl,appleguy
1208,2016-02-11 08:49:05,"@smyrgl thanks for the information!  It definitely helps clarify the issue.

Locking overhead is one of the most measurable parts of AsyncDisplayKit on the main thread with app architectures that minimize their own usage of main.  That said, the deadlock I mentioned in the commit log was obviously the prompt to investigate the change, which is far as I can tell does not compromise thread safety.

It is very complex to use Core Data in an app with multithreaded UI. This was experience in the main Facebook app with its architecture before ASDK & ComponentKit.  It was also experienced when building the Paper app which was based on Core Data for the first year of its development until it was ported off of it before launch.

The framework is one of the best in the world for dealing with certain types of data sets, and is also used by one of the very best contributors to the project (@Adlai-Holler).  Fortunately, the source of the deadlock can be very easily understood based on the AsyncDisplayKit threading model. Unfortunately, there is no documentation written about this.  The three part tutorial series from Ray Wenderlich may have an opportunity to cover this in the third tutorial, but I will definitely make sure it is added to the website documentation in the next couple months.

Specifically, the framework requires that background threads never synchronously wait on the main thread. The main thread is allowed to synchronously wait on any background thread, As this is necessary in a variety of URI timing sensitive operations that desire explicitly synchronous layout or display.

I think it would be very interesting to discuss this with anyone in the community who has better experience with Core Data than I do, as I am a couple years out of date (and ASDK itself was different then).  One thing that we'll almost certainly help your app architecture overcome this in a reliable and graceful way is the change from @Adlai-Holler (surprise!) That he is planning to finish in the next few days, in order to remove thread affinity assertions and oh allow even UIKit and CA bridge properties to be set in the background (even after isNodeLoaded).

It will not facilitate reading the values of /bridged/ properties in that same situation, but this is very rare and almost always possible to work around easily.  Reading is possible from all ASDK properties like attributedString, URL, image, are expected by the framework to be threadsafe (locking is practiced quite consistently in the framework, though some ~20% may need auditing - these cases are almost inconceivable to use in a concurrent way).

Thanks for your email, really glad to be in touch with you and excited to find a solution together!
",appleguy,smyrgl
1208,2016-02-12 17:45:17,"@appleguy @Adlai-Holler Ahhhhh...that's interesting and not something I was aware of but it makes sense.  Just one point of clarification: I assume when you say that I can't wait on the main thread from a background thread what you really mean is that I can't wait on an ADK queue background thread for the main thread?  In other words this would be ok?


",smyrgl,appleguy
1208,2016-02-12 18:23:30,"@appleguy Anyway regardless I don't have a lot of cases where I synchronously wait on the main thread in Core Data scenarios that I'm aware of (the above example is a bit contrived).  The reason being is that I have a two context setup but each is directly tied to the PSC and background context actually represents the master data--the main context is basically read only for the UI and all communication between the two happens via standard Core Data merges.  

However I do have cases with a few nodes where they use a Core Data object as the ""data source"" to setup the node like this:



I do this with a thread specific context because of the thread affinity problem.  If there wasn't thread affinity (or there was some way to dispatch back to it) I wouldn't need to do stuff like this and I could just async grab the data from a background context (something like a mirror of the main context but for ADK) and then use it directly.

a little bit concerning that the tests passed this time, clearly there is some kind of timing issue…
",appleguy,maicki
1200,2016-02-09 11:14:17,"@appleguy, it's very hard to say, given that the problem doesn't seem to be reproducible. I've tested the new transaction code a lot and never seen and draw calls missing. 

Anyway, I'll leave the test running locally with only once CPU core enabled (like on travis) over and over again, we'll see if it can be reproduced.
",knopp,appleguy
1200,2016-02-09 14:17:14,"@appleguy, I have some updates here.

The problem can be reproduced locally. You need to disable all CPU cores in instruments (only leave one active) and then run the `testTransaction` test for couple of tens of thousands times.

Eventually, it will get stuck. But the reason why it gets stuck is that GCD will refuse to overcommit the display queue. So the `dispatch_semaphore_wait` is blocking the display queue, and all subsequent calls are stuck, because the task that unblocks the semaphore is waiting in display queue too.

You can easily test this. When the test gets stuck, you can try scheduling a block on display queue inside the `ASDisplayNodeRunRunLoopUntilBlockIsTrue` loop - it will never be executed. 

So while the test fails occasionally, I think this is pretty harmless, because normally (outside of tests) one display queue task will not block waiting for another display queue block. 

I'm not sure how to fix the test though. GCD doesn't make any guarantees about overcommit, so you can't expect to have more threads running than CPU cores (even though it usually it is the case), which is required for this test to pass.

",appleguy,yxztj
1187,2016-11-23 00:24:47,"Hey @yxztj, this is actually the expected behavior.

I try to explain it a bit more in detail: If you set a ratio of 1.0 / 1.0 the ratio tries to use the constrained size that get's passed in to figure out the constrained size for the child that needs to calculate it's size based ont he passed in constrained size. Unfortunately because the way the overall layout is described the passed in constrained size in the ratio specs will be (0, 0), (Infinity, Infinity). As said ratio layout spec tries to figure out what's the best size is based on the child by passing in this constrained size into the ASImageNode child. There are now two cases:
1. Image is already set on the ASImageNode (with 0.0 delay): As in the time the ratio spec asks for the size based on the child image node and the image node already has an image assigned it will return this size for itself. Based on that the stack spec that contains the ratio spec tries to layout the two ratio specs but as it exceeds the width it will layout the left image node the size it would like to be and shrinks the right image
2. Image is not set on the ASImageNode (with 0.1 delay): In this case the ratio layout spec is passing in the unconstrained size to the child and as no image is set the image node will returned the passed in size as size of itself. Based on this the stack spec that contains the ratio specs tries to layout the two ratios specs but as both of these will have width and height unconstrained it will give it a width of 50% (minus the spacing). As the images are than set after the layout pass happened the images will both look like they have %50 width and a ratio of 1/1 what is actually not really true, the images are smaller as 1/1. With 2.0 it's actually a wrong behavior to use the image nodes this way and a log will be printed out as there is no size given to ASImageNode's that don't have a specific size set via `style.preferredSize` or an image assigned where the `ASImageNode` can determine the size

I will close that issue for now as this is expected behavior. Please reopen if there are open questions / issues. Thanks!",maicki,yxztj

I discovered that I am logging the 3rd and final vertical collectionView's contentSize.height.

Despite having the same rangeTuningParameters of 2.0 leading, 1.0 trailing, that 3rd feed in 1.9.5 immediately knew its contentSize.height upon init of the ""paging"" collectionView. In 1.9.6, the 3rd vertical feed isn't aware of its contentSize until it is on-screen for the first time. 

I would think that with my range tuning parameters it would have known its size sooner than its first on-screen appearance. But let me know if that is the expected behavior. For what it's worth, I am also able to replicate with the ASPagerNode and its default range tuning.

1172,2016-02-07 07:31:06,"@ilitvinenko90 the framework is not intended to release ASCellNodes.  as you scroll, every node (including the ASCellNode and every subnode) should have both -clearContents and -clearFetchedData call Barnett. After these methods are called, the memory overhead of the node should be on the order of a very small number of kilobytes. It should take thousands of nodes to add up to a few megabytes, nowhere close to tens or hundreds of megabytes.

Can you please provide some additional information?
- what version of the framework are you using?  Git SHA or version number.
- how are you loading images?  Especially if using SDWebImage, it is essential that you set the framework to provide compressed images to AsyncDisplayKit so it can manage their compression and decompression, otherwise you will get very serious memory problems. Using the AsyncDisplayKit memory management techniques should give you far better memory usage and then in a typical URI kid app using a generic image library.
- what other things are you doing in your ASCellNode?  Should any of those things be released in -clearFetchedData?

Please feel free to email me directly at asyncdisplaykit@gmail.com you have updated this task, or especially if you can send me a test project or reproduction case (I will keep the code confidential in case you can only do this by sharing some of your app source code).  Happy to help, this problem should actually be extremely quick to resolve.  Sorry for the trouble.

1172,2016-05-17 07:50:58,"@appleguy We're now using 1.9.73, testing using the Kittens example. The memory usage on launch is around 35MB, and after scrolling to bottom then top again, the memory rises to 39MB. Tried simulate memory warning on simulator, the memory usage won't drop. We noticed the image node holds a strong reference to the image object, and since the cell node never gets released, the image stays in memory as well.

We also use ASNetworkImageNode in our own app, with much more complexed and richer images in each cell node, so the memory increases really fast on scrolling down(could go up thens or hundreds of MB and then crashes due to OOM).

Is there any best practice we could follow in this situation? Thanks.

Few notes about what I did here:
1. Removed `_deleteSection`, `_insertSection` etc. These don't do much and made it very confusing to read the code.
2. **(Please review this part)** Every node editing methods previously all have a completion callback scheduled on the main thread and update the _completedNodes on the main thread. This made it hard and cause crashes when doing batch operations like ReloadSection/ReloadData etc. 
   Now these methods only change _editingNodes and do nothing with the _completedNodes. After we are done with the operations, we call `commitChangesToNodesOfKind` and provide a callback there. 
3. Optimized reloadSection/reloadData/reloadItems/deleteSection/insertSections on TableView and CollectionView. Previously, all of these actions result in deleteItems/insertItems calls to TableView and CollectionView. Now it makes one specific call. (for example, reloadSection calls tableview `reloadSections: withRowAnimation` instead of making `deleteRowsAtIndexPaths: and insertRowsAtIndexPaths:`)

I am not totally sure which of the three classes, if not all of them, will require changes.

Implementing the layout speck that fits method should be enough if you have a mechanism to also set the content size, for example in the layout did finish method is fine.

In my opinion, in validating the collection review layout itself is too expensive to do every frame, although I know it is a relatively common practice. Once you were doing this, it is actually quite cheap in comparison to reload the item at the index Path being manipulated. Have you tried doing this?

Go ahead and also try calling -setNeedsLayout on the ASCellNode at that in next path. I believe this is set up to re-request the constrainedSizeForNodeAtIndexPath: from the data source.  cc @nguyenhuy who can correct me if this is wrong.

If you take a look at the code, you will see that ASRangeControllerBeta is being used everywhere by default.

That's exactly what assert text states.
",zintus,mtorcutt
1144,2016-04-01 08:06:31,"@mtorcutt - There's been a recent behavior change that ensures that asynchronously displayed nodes are more tolerant to undergoing view rehosting events. Previously moving even the parent view of a node hierarchy to a different part of the view hierarchy, as occurs during a view controller transition, could cause the nodes to clear their contents, and this could negate a manual call to -recursivelyEnsureDisplay.

This has been fixed in recent versions and I am very interested to know if the same code you had before now works as you expect. Please let me know if you have time!

In general, for ASCellNodes that you would like to use ""synchronous concurrency"" type display, you should enable the .neverShowPlaceholders property for ASCellNode before you return it from the dataSource method. Also, if you have not adopted it yet, look at the newer variant of the data source method that returns a block, and in this case, simply set the property before the cell is returned from that block. 

If this approach works, it should remove any need for manually calling -recursivelyEnsureDisplay, but be aware that scrolling faster than the pre-display can keep up with, will cause some scrolling stutters. 

Feel free to reopen this issue, if you have any questions or the behavior is not fixed for you. I'd be happy to help!

Instead, all you have to do is invert the transform of the scroll view and its direct subviews.

You can check out SLKTextViewController for a sample implementation. What do you think about this approach?

If we are in agreement on this approach, @samhsiung would you be able to implement a BOOL option on the collection and table -- when enabled, applies the transform to the table and each cell?

Of course this is pretty easy for anyone to implement themselves, but because the approach is far from obvious to many people (including myself when I first heard of it years ago), I think it is justified to have a convenience API.  Maybe scrollsFromBottom or something.  A similar approach could support horizontal views that need to load leftwards, So maybe there is a more general name?

There are a couple use cases we'd lose by going with the transform approach:
- If you have a normal-scrolling table/collectionView that you wanted to fetch from the head. I don't think this is common though, and a refresh control seems to be the more standard way to handle that. 
- If you wanted to support fetching from both the head and tail. This is another case that I'd believe is pretty uncommon.

- If you have a normal-scrolling table/collectionView that you wanted to fetch from the head. I don't think this is common though, and a refresh control seems to be the more standard way to handle that. 
- If you wanted to support fetching from both the head and tail. This is another case that I'd believe is pretty uncommon. 

I think the transform approach is going to support the much more common scenario of having a table/collectionView that scrolls from the bottom.

If you want to create a new example app, just do Cmd-D in the finder on any app in examples/ -- the Xcode files and scheme are all called Sample for this reason.  If you can see a way to add it to any existing example as a new feature rather than creating a new one, that would be even better.

Hannah, could you add a documentation page we can point folks to with instructions on how to make an example app?  Later we might create a specific base project that limits the files that would otherwise need to be deleted.

My use case is really simple and aesthetic, it's just to make tags with some ""room to breath"".

For example, take a look at this tags and buttons:

I'm not sure if i did something wrong, but I can remember trying to achieve this using `ASButtonNode` setting a `preferredFrameSize` calculating the size of the string plus X points without luck.
I'm not even sure if `ASButtonNode` is considering `preferredFrameSize`, it seems that only `ASImageNode` is affected by this property, right?

In terms of using layoutSpecThatFits, you'll probably want to use `ASStackLayoutSpec` which lets you stack other nodes vertically & horizontally. Using a number of `ASStackLayoutSpec`'s will let you achieve the look you are going for.

1123,2016-06-21 21:48:40,"@alexrmacleod: Thanks for including the Swift example! We get quite a few asks for Swift examples and this could be our first ASDK Swift example project.

UIViewController + ASTableView is older ASDK code (many of our example projects our outdated). The newer style is ASViewController + ASTableNode as you mention. 

Benefits of using ASViewController over UIViewController:
- One of the main benefits to using an ASViewController is to save memory. An ASViewController that goes off screen will automatically reduce the size of the fetch data and display ranges of any of its children. This is key for memory management in large applications.
- support the new ""Visibility"" feature. From the 1.9.8 Release Notes: _ASNavigationController and ASTabBarController, which implement a new protocol ASVisibility. These classes can be used even without ASDisplayNodes, making them suitable base classes for your inheritance hierarchy. For any child view controllers that are ASViewControllers, these classes know the exact number of user taps it would take to make the view controller visible (0 if currently visible)._
- More features will be added over time, so it is a good idea to base your view controllers off of this class.

Your other questions:
- Yes, it is possible to achieve the same layout with ASTableNode and this is now the **recommend** way of doing it rather than using the ASTableView.
- Yes! If you would be willing to convert this Swift version to use ASTableNode, that would be even better to use in our examples directory. I'll wait to upload it until I hear back as to whether or not you would be willing to convert it. 

ASControlNode is the ASDK equivalent of a UIControl. All ASControlNodes have the `-addTarget:action:forControlEvents:` and the `hitTestSlop` property (to easily add UIEdgeInsets to make your tappable area larger). If you just need a tappable area (with no image or text or state changing), this is a quick way to do it. 

http://asyncdisplaykit.org/docs/control-node.html
http://asyncdisplaykit.org/docs/hit-test-slop.html
http://asyncdisplaykit.org/docs/debug-tool-hit-test-visualization.html

ASButtonNode is a subclass of ASControlNode and supports state-changing background images, state-changing titles, contentEdgeInsets and more. NOTE: the selected property logic of the ASButtonNode should be handled by the developer. Tapping the ASButtonNode does not automatically enable selected.

Then we can destroy the text node.  This should actually be quite efficient, and would also cache the result automatically.

This is the minimum I can do to get the compiler to crash:



Either one of these variations, and the compiler works great:





We definitely have a lot of protocol composition going on with `ASLayoutable` and its implementors but it all makes good sense. Considering the fact that removing `self` fixes the compiler crash, I think this is something out of my league in the Swift optimizer.

The issue is not resolved in Xcode 7.3 Beta 2, so I've submitted a bug to Apple https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6191944728313856 as well as a reduced test case at https://github.com/Adlai-Holler/ASDKWMOTest

That is because you are basically trying to do this:
`let foo = ASStaticLayoutSpec(children: [foo])`
Which produces the error = ""Variable used within its own initial value"". The compiler is just getting confused at this point because the code passes the inline syntax validation (since it isn't fully aware of what your code is trying to accomplish)

1080,2016-01-24 02:08:40,"This is a great piece of performance research.  I wish we were working together 1-1 on a day to day basis, @knopp!

I've been worried about this for some time now, but assumed it was primarily an issue if there was excessive / abnormal blocking of blocks like display blocks contending on a lock.  However, it makes sense that could happen if decoding relatively high resolution images on a slow CPU (the iPad 3 being an ideal test case here).  The symptoms match what I'm seeing in just the last few days of starting to profile our new Pinterest implementation on iPad 3, where I'm now focusing all of the optimization time.

The change you've made is very important, although I'm not sure if it is the easiest way to achieve what we need — I'm fine with the approach it uses as long as we increase the concurrent display count to /at least/ 2\* the CPU core count.  Starting at 2x cores is fine for now, as there will of course be layout operations, network parsing, main thread, etc but we do want a pretty high degree of saturation without excessive context switching.

I'll merge the change as soon as 1.9.6 is out, and start testing it heavily in Pinterest - and ask the ASDK community leaders to start doing the same in their apps :).
",appleguy,knopp
1080,2016-01-24 02:54:10,"@appleguy, there are some benefits to my implementation :)

It doesn't modify much of ASDisplayKit code. The `ASAsyncTransactionQueue::Group` works very similarly to `dispatch_group_t`, including possibility of manual enter and leave.

It is also quite flexible. I went ahead and did a proof of concept implementation of drawing priority here https://github.com/knopp/AsyncDisplayKit/commit/446c62a7a1595ca9f77ca20694ba6d5d0e159294

In this branch it is possible to assign any `ASDisplayNode` custom drawing priority, where nodes with higher priority render first. In our case we have several labels in each node and one rather large thumbnail image. We definitely want the labels to be rendered before the thumbnails. In the branch I linked to this is as simple as setting `imageNode.drawingPriority = ASDefaultDrawingPriority - 1;` and it seems to work quite well.

Do you think this could be something generally usable or do we have weird use case?
",knopp,appleguy
1080,2016-01-24 03:10:38,"Out of curiosity, @appleguy, why do you insist on `2 * activeProcessorCount` threads? I tried it on iPad 3, and during scrolling the experience seems worse than having just `activeProcessorCount` threads. 
",knopp,appleguy
1080,2016-01-24 04:27:23,"@knopp very interesting.  In your testing, you find it clearly & unambiguously worse in terms of visual assessment of frame drops?

My findings during the development of Paper implied that having a few extra concurrent operations allowed the system to continue running another operation when one blocked on a system call or other resource.  In some cases the display method may load from a disk cache, for example, which isn't that unreasonable of a pattern (although fetchData is intended for this, that range could be zero'd out or set to the same as the display range, or the logic to retrieve from cache could just be put in the display method itself).

This would be particularly true when the main thread is not active, potentially allowing incremental increases in efficiency / total throughput of rendering operations (a very good things to preload ahead of the user as fast as possible).

The other reason, which is probably even more important, is to ensure that a small number of very large / long render operations (e.g. decoding fullscreen images) don't block small and fast operations (e.g. decoding a tiny icon, rendering a small label, etc).  Also, image decoding and text decoding engage different parts of the system stack that has often-inefficient internal lock contention, so it's preferred to have one thread doing text and another doing images than getting two images stuck in the pipeline and blocking all the text labels.

That said, your empirical finding today is a lot more meaningful to me than investigations I conducted a few years ago.  With that knowledge, I agree we should land with this current value and not change it until any further research is conducted.  Though it would be difficult to tune, we might want to look at something like whether a displaylink shows any frames are being dropped at all (say for the past several seconds) and dials back the concurrency count if there are any drops - and otherwise sets it higher.  But that would only make sense if I could re-verify and quantify the magnitude of any throughput increase from more heavily loading the CPU, which would have to be great enough to overcome context switching costs of course.

The ""right"" solution here is to invest in further sophistication of this system in at least two respects: separate queues (text & images at a minimum), and more dynamic prioritization to be able to always ensure the visible area is prioritized, the offscreen upcoming area is next, and anything unrendered in the outgoing area is last.
",appleguy,knopp
1080,2016-01-24 15:54:52,"@appleguy, that's the nice thing about custom queue. Here I did a simple prioritization https://github.com/knopp/AsyncDisplayKit/commit/446c62a7a1595ca9f77ca20694ba6d5d0e159294 as a proof of concept, but it could be easily done in a way where you can schedule text and image drawing on different threads.

As for `CADisplayLink` I find it very unreliable. It often invokes the callback 60 times per second, even if there are obviously frames being dropped. 
",knopp,appleguy
1080,2016-01-26 06:50:28,"@appleguy, I didn't mean that it is entirely useless. In my experience it helps with simpler cases when you do something heavy in main thread, or the main thread gets smothered by several render threads, but ASDK is sort of past that. It's the other, more frustrating cases, i.e. when setting layer.contents causes occasional jerk on iPad Air 2, even though there's plenty of CPU time to spare, and CADisplayLink happily fires 60 times a second. I guess this falls under GPU bound.

I don't mind keeping this issue open for now, but if it's getting out of hand you can create the more general one.

1079,2016-01-20 02:37:59,"@aaronschubert0 this is fascinating.  Thank you for researching this.  It is an extremely important issue, yet there are very few folks prepared to debug the text system.

What kind of test case(s) do you have that helped you diagnose the issue?  My top priority is getting the fix in, especially since it looks like I'm going to do a 1.9.5.1 shortly (unfortunately - see #1083).  However, if you have appropriate test cases, I want to at least file an issue to ensure that we add a snapshot test to verify this behavior in the face of future text changes.

Could you explain why the new calculation is correct?  Why exactly would we add the origin value to the size, in order to generate a size?
",appleguy,aaronschubert0
1079,2016-01-20 15:22:27,"Hey @appleguy awesome. Yeah it's definitely a crucial area to invest time in. The test case that I used was the example project linked in #1076 and the debugger. So I definitely need to write some actual tests. Basically it seems that most properties of NSAttributedString are interpreted properly by our text size calculations since they change the size of the text container to achieve their 'effect'. In contrary headIndent (and I assume tailIndent) achieves it's effect by altering the origin of the whole text container, rather than altering the size, so .headIndent = 10 will result in the size to remain the same but the origin will now be (10, 0) rather than (0, 0). Since the positioning of our nodes are usually done by the parent (i.e in a layoutSpec method) it is appropriate to just alter the resulting size of textNode since that will result in the desired affect (that was my thinking behind the change anyway)

",levi,levi
1064,2016-01-22 05:10:43,"@binl I'm going to merge this now so that you can continue at full speed, but it's important to me that we move this initializer into a +Beta.h file so that it can't be used without an engineer being clear that it's a new API that hasn't been widely tested / broadly discussed with tech leads of different apps with their many differences in use cases.

In particular we should work together to solidify the relationship between the layout inspector and the layout facilitator, and although I think it's likely the API will remain unchanged for the final version (just as you have it now), it's important to put it in +Beta because there could be some bugs / inconsistencies that haven't been sorted out yet (like supporting @nguyenhuy's new reloading setup).

I need to release a new version of ASDK in the next ~24hrs, so if you won't have a chance to create the +Beta.h file, just let me know and I can make the tweak before that release goes out (it's needed for a couple other critical fixes).
",appleguy,binl
1063,2016-01-19 04:57:01,"@lkzhao I got some answers on this from the original author of the code.

""Hey Scott — following up on the radar. Apple closed it as behaving correctly. I clarified the bug in the radar — the bug is really that ""When `scrollEnabled` is NO, UITextView no longer updates its `contentSize`.""  This makes it impossible to tell how large the text is / how big to make the text view if you want to embed it inside of another custom UIScrollView.""

So basically in Paper we had to leave scrollEnabled as YES so the sizing calculation was done, /but/, we actually did not want it to scroll by itself, because we needed the text to scroll inside a shared scroll view with a bunch of other elements alongside the text.

@lkzhao can you make a change so that _ASDisabledPanUITextView is instead named ASPanningOverriddenUITextView, and then add an instance variable for ""_shouldBlockPanGesture""?  The ASPanningOverriddenUITextView should also override setScrollEnabled:.  It should always call [super setScrollEnabled:YES], but then just set the value appropriately for the _shouldBlockPanGesture.  Then the instance variable can be used in the UIGestureRecognizer method.

I know this feels hacky, because it is, but I don't want this change to break Instant Articles that probably still depends on this behavior - the Apple behavior is really not correct in my opinion.

Lastly, please expose a scrollEnabled property on the ASEditableTextNode in the header.  Ideally you can implement this in such a way that it does not trigger the view to be created, because it is extremely expensive to create a UITextView, and ASDisplayNodes are sometimes created and destroyed without their view ever being loaded.  The value for scrollEnabled: can be applied in -didLoad.

1062,2016-03-31 05:19:24,"@Adlai-Holler this is also true for the static library, not just for the framework target. Of course, the name should imply this, but the current exposure of the file is completely intentional :)  the use case you're referencing is certainly valid, but this is pretty clearly not the right way to address that use case.

Feel free to move that method to ASDisplayNode+Beta.h or a similar location intended for APIs in transition or with a limited number of users who are aware of the associated risks. The API surface for controlling the detailed behavior of synchronous concurrency has not been audited, and so the naming and functionality is likely to change in the future, but I suspect this is not a significant issue for your app!

1057,2016-01-19 05:17:10,"@Cabus thanks for asking about this.  This is almost certainly on the cusp of working, but not quite there.  I have actually never tried an animated layout change, and neither has anyone asked me about it, which is pretty surprising...but for that reason we probably need a few lines of changes within the framework.

Example causes might be:
- We need to ensure all of the cells have calculated their new layout in order to animate; this may have to be forced to occur synchronously.  Good news is we have facilities to block the main thread on a concurrent background operation, so this should literally double performance compared to UIKit normally.
- itemSize is not fully integrated with the layout system, because it is not as expressive / well-integrated with the layout system as constrainedSize is.  It's also trapped by the non-threadsafe UICollectionViewLayout object :).  That said, this really is a bug / limitation more than anything else: particularly if constrainedSizeForItemAtIndexPath: is not implemented, we should be using itemSize.  I think there might already be some code to do this, but it hasn't been rigorously tested, and we might need something like an invalidateLayout call when itemSize changes etc.

@levi are you familiar with collection view animations?  I'm wondering if you could audit the code for issues in the area of fixed itemSize and animations / transitions, just to highlight what areas might need work, even if you don't have time to make the change.

When adding / removing nodes, the index paths in `_allPreviousIndexPaths` may simply point to wrong nodes, but still be non null. So even if it doesn't crash, it won't behave correctly. 

I think there are two possible solutions - either do what I did in the branch - update `_allPreviousIndexPaths` every time the data controller adds/removes nodes/sections, or simply discard `_allPreviousIndexPaths` when adding/removing and next time `_updateVisibleNodeIndexPaths` is called, iterate over all nodes from data source.

1054,2016-01-14 01:23:34,"@knopp are you sure it won't behave correctly in the *Beta version?  Very very interested in your thoughts there.  For each index path, we independently check if it currently lies within each range.  I think that should be sufficient, but I have not yet deeply considered this _editing vs _completed nodes issue.  _editingExternalNodes was added after my original refactor of ASDataController and I'm actually pretty concerned about it, and will evaluate if it is possible to re-simplify some of that stuff.

For this diff, do you have any test apps / test cases that you used?  I want to get a fix for this issue out as quickly as possible, and I would believe that this approach addresses conditions that #1060 does not, but I am worried about pushing this out with minimal testing.  Is there a scenario you can describe that does in fact break #1060 (or more importantly, *Beta, because it will become Stable within a couple weeks), but is addressed by this change?

1054,2016-01-14 02:07:23,"@appleguy, here is project that is broken with current `ASRangeController` but works with this pull request: https://github.com/tomizimobile/ASDKSearchIssue

## 

Regarding `ASRangeControllerBeta`: _Each index path_ (`allIndexPaths`) that you check belongs to union of fetch, display, visible and `_allPreviousIndexPaths`. Now consider following scenario:

We have node`[0,0]` that is visible, and appropriate indexPath `[0,0`] is in `_allPreviousIndexPaths`; Let's call it original node;

Now this happens between invocations of  `_updateVisibleNodeIndexPaths`
1. New node is added to `[0,0]`; This causes original node index path `[0,0]` to become `[0,1]`.(`_allPreviousIndexPaths` doesn't change in any way though and still contains `[0,0]`)
2. Collection view is instantly scrolled in a way where section 0 is no longer in fetch, display or visible;

The original node is still marked as visible, even though it no longer is. That is because the union of fetch, display, visible and `_allPreviousIndexPaths` contains `[0,0]`. But original node is no longer `[0,0]`, it is now `[0,1]` (because another node was added to `[0,0]`. So the original node is missed while iterating `allIndexPaths` and not updated.

1044,2016-01-07 03:12:25,"@knopp yes, optimizing down the UICollectionViewLayout stuff is a big priority, but unfortunately we are limited in part because most folks don't want to adopt an asynchronous class for this.  In an ideal world, we could use something like ASFlowLayoutController (which could be used on a background thread), and then even the ASRangeController updates could be done asynchronously (except for visible range changes, which would have to wait on those updates - still would be a lot better).

The user retains the right to set the tuning parameters to anything, so they could even make the FetchData range 0.  However, it is definitely possible to check whether the range encompasses the other ranges.

The concern is that something needs to check whether each indexPath is in a certain range.  Even with the old implementation, this was pretty heavy weight--since collection layouts can be totally arbitrary, with items not even shown in contiguous order, we need to ask the layout what indexPaths exist inside each range separately so we can tell when a path changes from one to the other.

I think the cause of this is actually in the ASLayoutController classes. Previously, there was a suspicious bit of code (look for updateBounds) that limited the frequency of range updates.  I'm not convinced this is the right approach, but there is probably a balance that can be achieved where performance is /better/ than it was previously and still more frequently updated.

All this said, the class is still Beta considering that I haven't yet run a profiler on the new implementation (something I'm naturally quite passionate about).  It's been one of the most intense work-weeks of my career getting back to the office after the holiday weeks being focused on ASDK, so I'm really bummed that I am not going to have time to make big progress here until each weekend (and some nights).  In total, by late January, I should have this code in better shape.

Thank you for testing it and sharing your detailed findings!
",appleguy,knopp
1044,2016-01-07 03:38:34,"@appleguy, thanks for the reply. I understand completely that you're busy

What I meant by the optimization is that instead of 3 calls to `[_collectionViewLayout layoutAttributesForElementsInRect:]` there would be only one. That should be doable, regardless of underlying layout.

The rect would be fetch bounds. After that you iterate over layout attributes and if the attribute frame is within visible / display range bounds, you add the attribute index path to appropriate set.

To do this however, `ASLayoutController` would need another method, something like `NSDictionary<ASLayoutRangeType, NSSet> indexPathsForScrolling:(ASScrollDirection)scrollDirection`, so that it could provide index path for all range types in one call.

I'll try doing this - I'm wondering if it makes noticeable difference.
",knopp,appleguy
1044,2016-01-07 08:51:31,"@knopp I think each independent range set is mandatory to perform the containsObject: calls which OR each flag in the interfaceState bitfield, right?

Fortunately, I did profile this code running against Pinterest on some ideal older device hardware - iPad mini 1, etc.  I found numerous possible optimizations and will be working on them in the next few days.  If you are able to look at this area, please do, because the single most impactful optimization is actually going to be in the scheduleDisplayForNode: and setInterfaceState: application code paths, with the UICollectionViewLayout ranges being a close third.  This is a very important issue that will definitely need investigation and optimization, so let me know when you reach a point where you are ready to pause investigation and hand off (even if it turns out a win is too hard to implement) 
",appleguy,knopp
1044,2016-01-08 21:30:41,"@knopp Thanks for your work on this - I will check out your diff very soon.

Last night I came up with what I think is a very good idea.  I am going to move the calculation and application of the render and fetch data range to the background.  This will be a bit tricky, because a new main thread update may come in before those have finished, but I have ideas on how to do this.  Visible range will of course still be processed on the main thread to make sure that the call is 100% reliable in meaning ""exactly visible"".

This makes a lot of sense because then -fetchData will be called in the background, which is better for the work that it takes to put together a network request or database query - and also -scheduleNodeForDisplay can be called in the background, reducing work adding stuff to collections and gathering draw parameters for the display pass.  These two operations are inherently designed to be asynchronous and are supposed to be triggered before something is onscreen, so the /exact/ runloop in which they occur is not important.

What do you think about this?  My greatest concern is:
- fetchData would be called in the background, which it wasn't previously.  Some existing user code may not work with this.  That said, it is fairly rare to implement fetchData yourself - ASNetworkImageNode and ASMultiplexImageNode are the most common usages of it and they should be thread safe, and their safety is something I can audit and then ensure.
- the draw parameters method is normally called on the main thread, and ideally this would move it to a background thread.  Same problems apply — users may need to use some kind of locking mechanism to ensure that while this method is being run, any changes on the main thread to their properties are blocked on the lock.  This would be OK because the threading model states the main thread can be blocked on any background thread when needed, and that a background thread must NEVER block on a synchronous dispatch to the main thread.  Safer option would be to call system draw parameter methods like for ASImageNode and ASTextNode in the background, which these are the most common and expensive ones by far anyway, and find a way to continue calling third party implemented ones on the main thread.

Let me know your thoughts!
",appleguy,knopp
1044,2016-01-08 22:06:05,"@knopp indeed you're right about drawParameters so I'm going to have to consider that one more carefully.  Harvesting it on the main thread is still feasible even if we're dispatching the range handling to the background, but it would be best especially if ASTextNode and ASImageNode can have a custom locking setup to allow them to harvest draw parameters in the background because those specific classes are fairly heavy.

I am planning to add another method to the ""...LayoutInspector"" protocol to allow indexPathsForElementsInRect: to be called in the background.  This can be backed by ASFlowLayoutController for UICollectionViewFlowLayout, and for custom layouts, a developer can optionally implement it if they want higher performance.  The idea would be to only include the indexPaths, not an entire UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes, which in addition to being in the background would help a lot.

1044,2016-01-10 12:26:42,"@appleguy, this is indeed much faster with your latest commits (https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/1053)

",knopp,appleguy
1044,2016-01-11 02:45:29,"@appleguy, looks like I did miss something. When things seem too good to be true, they probably are. I ran the previous test with fetch/display range tuning set to 0; This is with correct default values



So it is still slightly worse than `ASRangeControllerStable`
",knopp,appleguy
1044,2016-01-24 01:33:57,"@knopp Thanks for your focus on this - I am far from done optimizing here, but I think we're in a good enough state that performance relative to Stable is not a defining element in when we can switch.

One of the senior engineers at Pinterest will be working on a change next week to allow asynchronous allocation of ASCellNodes.  We'll follow that up with a longer-term project (probably have a diff up by latter half of February) to split the allocation / assembly of the layer and view hierarchy across multiple turns of the runloop (thereby giving time for the runloop to decide to execute touch handlers, timers / displaylink, etc).  Naturally if an element enters the visible range, we'll block on finishing the allocation and assembly of the hierarchy at that point, but this should make a revolutionary difference in the largest remaining main thread impact in most apps.

Additionally, also next week, we're moving the display methods of ASTextNode and ASImageNode to a locking-based instance method (FrameworkPrivate for now) rather than creating the display parameters — this should be a pretty substantial win in the cost of the display range.

So with all three - async ASCellNode, direct instance display for key classes, and runloop amortization for hierarchy materialization - we should be at a radically improved state compared to today's framework on Stable.  Granted, most of these optimizations could be used with the Stable range controller too, but at that point I think holding parity as the bar for adopting a higher degree of correctness wouldn't be the right thing.  Still though, there are more wins to be had in the Beta range controller calculations itself, including the async application of interfaceState to nodes that aren't in the visible range.

Fortunately, i think the solution can be implemented in a way that is extremely efficient - scanning over the total set of nodes can be done by accessing the interfaceState ivar directly without even a method call, and in the majority of normal situations any action will be skipped as it will have passed through the other ranges.

This is very important to fix.  Do you have any suggestions for how to easily create a test case, say by modifying a sample app like VerticalWithinHorizontalScrolling or any other one?  I should be able to fix this tomorrow.

1034,2016-01-06 13:33:36,"@appleguy, thanks, it does seem to report state correctly after the commit.

However now that you store indexPaths between `_updateVisibleNodeIndexPaths` invocations, it suffers from https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/issues/1028 as well. That happens because when adding/removing sections / index paths `_allPreviousIndexPaths` suddenly point to different or non existing nodes. In fact it can be reproduced by same test project https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/issues/1028 can (https://github.com/tomizimobile/ASDKSearchIssue).

The way I see it, there are two ways to fix it.

1) Update `allPreviousIndexPaths` when adding/removing nodes. This is how I fixed https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/issues/1028 in my fork. 
-or-
2) When `_rangeIsValid` is set to `NO`, forget `allPreviousIndexPaths` and fetch all possible index paths and iterate on them

The second one would be easier to implement, but there is currently no way for range controller to fetch  all index paths. I didn't want to modify interfaces so I went with 1) instead here https://github.com/knopp/AsyncDisplayKit/commit/f76fd58840c5706245ba4cc229892fcf8d554303

1033,2016-01-06 06:24:47,"@tomizimobile thanks for the report.  There were definitely changes in this code.  It is possible that in certain initialization orders, the ASTextKitTailTruncater doesn't work correctly.  See my commit hash 99fbc97 if you want to experiment with reverting it to test, or look at the changelog for ASTextKitRenderer and ASTextNode.  Most of the changes there since 1.9.3 should be possible to revert without affecting any other dependencies across AsyncDisplayKit.

I will most likely be able to investigate this by the end of the weekend, and might have time tomorrow (otherwise it's Friday night).  Let me know if you happen to learn anything else about it, but you should save your time if work is demanding right now!
",appleguy,tomizimobile
1033,2016-01-06 14:34:45,"@appleguy Thanks for the lead! I took a quick dig into it and I found that things work as expected if `_truncater` is set during initialization of `ASTextKitRenderer`. I'm not too familiar with the code, so I don't know if this has any side effects, but I'd guess it's basically negating any optimizations that were attempted. I'll have to leave reworking that to someone else, but at least for now I've got an interim fix.

Might be worth checking the implementation of the unit tests and adding / modifying one to include whatever code you're using to test this, because there are snapshot tests for the truncater already which are passing...but also weren't failing before!

",singno,appleguy
1032,2016-01-07 03:04:03,"@singno I believe I understand the problem now.  Your test app was helpful and allowed me to do detailed memory debugging quickly.

This is a recent issue I caused as I am trying to get as much of the logic out of ASTableView and ASCollectionView as possible, and move it into ASTableNode and ASCollectionNode.  The reason is that these two classes will then share a common superclass (something like ASRangeScrollingNode), a big step forward for the cleanliness and flexibility of this important architecture.

Unfortunately it looks like there is, internally, a strong pointer to the view from the node - even though I had taken measures to avoid this, they were insufficient - and if users create ASTableView directly, then it must have a strong pointer to the underlying ASTableNode that it creates (or it will be deallocated immediately).

The quickest fix that I recommend, and should be safe to always depend on, is to use ASTableNode and ASCollectionNode instead of the *View versions.  This is also by far the best practice for being able to embed collections and tables inside one another.  To do this, all you need to do is access the TableNode's .view property and add that as a subview of a view controller, or you could even put in -loadView something like ""self.view = tableNode.view"".  You can also use [view addSubnode:tableNode], which accesses the .view property for you.

Let me know if you have any trouble with this.  Thanks for emailing me.
",appleguy,singno
1031,2016-01-06 06:19:16,"@yxztj this is a good test case.  It might be that you need to set .flexGrow or some other ASLayoutable / ASStackLayoutable property.

Have you tried using ASCenterLayoutSpec?  Let me know what that does for you.  I will debug this by the end of the weekend - hopefully tomorrow, though.

1031,2016-01-06 07:36:20,"@appleguy The frame of the text node is correct. The problem is that text is not rendered correctly in the text node, instead it has an unexpected horizontal offset.(Looks like the text inside the node is centered in a larger frame)
We are using text attributes to align the text at center, so if there are multiple lines they are all centered.

1031,2016-01-26 04:18:35,"@yxztj Thanks again for this.  You should always use ASCenterLayoutSpec or another layout means to center text, whenever that is possible.  If you must mix the text and can't use different text nodes, and still need centering for part of the text, using NSParagraphStyle is acceptable.  The reason to prefer layout is that it can result in the text node being smaller, and a minimal size text node that is simply positioned where you want will use significantly less memory.  Please test master / 1.9.6 as the paragraph style centering should now work reliably.

That logic was indeed changed late in the release (cc @knopp)  Unfortunately I don't have a test case that can trigger this issue, making it very difficult to fix without simply reverting the change (which itself addresses a known, reproducible issue).

One option you may want to try is the new ASRangeControllerBeta.  It is significantly improved and is available if you import ASDisplayNode+Beta.h, and call [ASDisplayNode setShouldUseNewRenderingRange:YES];

I have been using this by default for the internal / development version of Pinterest, and so far it is working very well.  However, it is changing rapidly and not widely tested yet, so you may experience some issues with that as well.  I'd appreciate your feedback / report if you can try your code with it, to see if any similar issues arise - but I'm fairly confident that you won't see a crash, and at worst may see some issues where content isn't pre-loaded as early as expected or potentially higher memory usage.

I'm using https://github.com/knopp/AsyncDisplayKit/commit/c0c98c0cefaa99fa2f56892818567f0e7eb283c8. It's not always replicated using the same exact steps, but I found a fairly easy way to make it happen. I've updated my test project (https://github.com/tomizimobile/ASDKSearchIssue) to randomly generate 1000 ""names"", and when typing text/deleting text a few times, a crash will happen (I was just typing ""qqq"" and deleting the text repeatedly until it happened).
",tomizimobile,knopp
1028,2016-01-11 19:25:34,"@tomizimobile, there are two issues. First, there is race in your code. AsyncDisplayKit `tableView.endUpdates` is asynchronous. So you probably shouldn't update predicate until endUpdates finishes. You can use `endUpdatesAnimated` which has a block that will notify you when endUpdates is done.

Same goes for `reloadData`. You should use `reloadDataWithCompletion` and not change predicate while reload data is in progress.

The second issue is much more peculiar. After changing the code so that `applyPredicate` is not called while update is in progress, `[UITableView endUpdates]` sometimes gets stuck for several seconds or longer sorting index paths. That's extremely weird. I initially thought it deadlocks, but it looks like when given enough time it finishes.

One way to debug this would be to swizzle [NSArray sortedArrayUsingSelector:] to see what index paths are being sorted.
",knopp,tomizimobile
1028,2016-01-11 19:38:57,"@knopp Ah, that makes sense. I guess I was envisioning that AsyncDisplayKit would handle interrupting a current reload/update operation if another one was started. In my current project, I do a little more work than this test project to make sure I lock/unlock the data source properly, so that the data isn't changed underneath the current operation. Maybe it's still better to prevent any updates from being started until the previous one completes.

Could the second issue be due to the way you changed the code to not call `applyPredicate` while an update is in progress? I'm sure it's expensive to create all of these cells with each filter operation, and if you're not cancelling/skipping any of the update operations when a new one comes in before the current one is complete, maybe the CPU is just getting backed up.
",tomizimobile,knopp
1028,2016-01-11 19:46:00,"@tomizimobile, that's quite unlikely. Even with `applyPredicate` delayed, you still have finite amount of cells added/removed, which is not larger than your 1000 generated names.  Hanging the main thread like this, it can only mean that either the table view is sorting ridiculous amount of index paths, or the sort selector is really slow.
",knopp,tomizimobile
1028,2016-01-11 20:32:49,"@knopp I'm curious what changes you made to my test project to run into that situation. I just updated my test project again with a quick implementation of delaying applying a predicate until the current operation finishes. I can still cause crashes, and I don't see the several second delay that you mentioned. Am I missing something? Note that my test project is _not_ pointing directly to your commit - I've made that change locally and run `pod update` on it.

1019,2015-12-31 01:56:12,"@frankenthumbs you're right - this is a bug, and is why I am rewriting ASRangeController (in progress right now) to remove almost all of the state that it independently maintains and to reliably set ASInterfaceState (a brand new property in the framework, so we're just now taking full advantage of its expressive power).

If you look at the implementation of ASNetworkImageNode, you'll see it calls -fetchData on itself in -displayWillStart.  This is, in many cases, a workaround for this problem because display is guaranteed to occur for anything in the display range or visible range, whereas the -fetchData call may not occur for initially-visible items or certain types of item reloads.

I apologize for this unfortunate rough edge of the API.  IMO, it is unacceptable to have this kind of subtly unreliable behavior in a framework, which is why it has now reached the top of my priority list. Most of my development work in the last several weeks (including the very creation of ASInterfaceState and ASHierarchyState) has been motivated specifically to enable the rewrite of ASRangeController to a functional architecture that should prove far easier to have an extensive library of unit tests and consistently reliable call behavior.

Support for the languages of the world has been a top motivator for me since the first prototypes of AsyncDisplayKit, because many languages take more computational effort to perform layout as well as rasterization than the English-biased developers frequently building iOS frameworks.  A few questions:
- Have you replicated this test with UILabel, UITextField, or UITextView?  How about the older NSString-based sizing methods that pass in a font directly?
- Have you tried using CoreText or TextKit directly, which are what ASTextNode is built on?
- Do you have a set of recommendations or test cases for how I could verify what behavior is correct / expected?  Do you feel that the sizing behavior of NSAttributedString itself is consistently correct?

@ocrickard - I promise not to invoke you on every text issue we run across (you may be surprised that I've fixed several recently and am becoming increasingly comfortable with the rendering code that was previously opaque to me).  However, I have to ask: has anything like this (let's say CJK languages in general) been studied, or issues reported, with ComponentKit?

output is



I believe some padding in text filed so the width is larger. You're right. The CoreText result is the same as ASTextNode. I didn't deep dive in basic text widgets. Do you know the calculation detail of these basic widgets?

Actually I would like to have stable calculation result while using pure CJK and English-CJK-Mix. Because these two situation are common in non-English-language market. The stable height make UI designer happy :smiley: . What I want is the sizing behavior of NSAttributedString. Do you guys have any idea to workaround this or ""fix"" this?

I believe this problem is some kind of relative to font. Since iOS9, the system default font for Chinese is PingFang. I explicit use `[UIFont fontWithName:@""Helvetica"" size:17.0]`. The calculation of pure CJK and English-CJK-Mix are the same using ASTextNode and CoreText in iOS9.2. Even though it is still different from apple's NSStringDrawing categories.

@binchensjtu Have you tried AsyncDisplayKit's behavior on 1.9.2 as well as the more recent versions?

1012,2015-12-29 07:04:07,"@NatashaTheRobot hey, thank you!  I've seen you on twitter (before earlier today of course, too) - great to have you here :).  I'm happy to say that another community member, @lappp9, is starting a huge push on updating the website and the documentation for 2.0 (note the 1.9.x releases contain most of the features that 2.0 will, but has not GM'd due to the lack of documentation).

Our strategy regarding Swift, briefly, is as follows:
- We're now actively listening to the Swift community for feedback on the API design and what improvements can be made; some of our top contributors are are using Swift in their day jobs.
- The new, redesigned example app that the 2.0 programming guide will walk through will be written with both Objective-C and Swift (although, the initial version will start with Objective-C).
- The site will include an inline switcher for each code snippet to toggle between the languages.
- In 6-12 months, we'll likely be Swift-first for example apps and documentation changes, with back-ports to Objective-C continuing for a couple years.  Usage within the framework will probably start around this time, especially if 3.0 means the runtime won't need to be bundled in each app.

Considering the extreme lack of documentation for rather powerful APIs like ASLayoutSpec, don't hesitate to reach out with any feedback or questions — I'd sincerely enjoy talking to you about it!  I can give you my iMessage number if you email asyncdisplaykit@gmail.com.

1011,2015-12-29 03:17:48,"@knopp Good bug - thank you for reporting this.

I am actually planning to rewrite ASRangeController soon.  If you look in ASDisplayNode+Beta.h, you'll see the option that Pinterest is currently using internally, which basically means that ASRangeHandler (especially ASRangeHandlerRender) can go away and be driven entirely by ASInterfaceState.  This will also mean that the range update method can be made super efficient, and do one pass over the nodes to determine every range that each node should be in, and then just call setInterfaceState: on the node with the full bitfield.  Then the node will automatically perform only the state transitions necessary, and not even recursively call its subnodes to update if there is no change in the ASInterfaceState.  It will actually be more efficient than the current system even though setInterfaceState: will be called relatively frequently, and will eliminate almost all of the state that ASRangeController currently needs to track and keep in sync with ASDataController.  If you have any interest in attempting this change (to be enabled only when the new render ahead system is enabled), feel free to give it a shot - just let me know if so, because in that case I would spend my effort on another part of the many areas of the framework I want to upgrade in the next few weeks :).

The other key areas I'm working on involve the reloading options for table / collection which will enable super high efficiency synchronous loading to ensure the minimal amount of main thread blocking occurs to get the visible range populated, performing concurrent measurement and display on just enough cells to fill that visible area (even if the visible area is scrolled down many screens from the top).  This should allow you to consolidate the two calls to be something more like -loadDataToEnsureDisplayInRect:(CGRect) scrollToVisible:(BOOL).

That said, I will investigate this tonight or tomorrow to see if there is a targeted fix that I can land in time for 1.9.4.  Just to confirm, what commit / version are you testing on?  Please make sure to try out master just to be certain, because there have been a variety of changes / improvements.

Please continue to file any issues for either feature requests or suboptimal behaviors you've observed from using the framework - I can tell you are fairly experienced and would very highly value your input on a variety of topics.
",appleguy,knopp
1011,2015-12-30 05:04:01,"@knopp I was unclear - my apologies.  The mode I mentioned does not currently impact ASRangeController's implementation, but it will in the next week or so.  With that mode on, it is no longer necessary to have the complex, stateful implementation seen in ASRangeHandlerRender.  Because of the removal of the need to maintain the nodes in the workingWindow when they are not visible (and thus treat visibility different than offscreen-but-should-display), it will be possible to dramatically simplify and optimize the implementation of ASRangeController to set the correct ASInterfaceState on every node on every pass.  I believe this will either directly resolve, or much more readily enable resolving the issue you've pointed out.

So far I have not been able to reproduce.  Using my latest PR (it should be landed by the time you read this, #1014) I added this code to the VerticalWithinHorizontalScrolling example to be triggered after tapping the Redo button in the navigation bar:

  [_pagerNode.view reloadDataWithCompletion:^{
    [_pagerNode.view scrollToItemAtIndexPath:[NSIndexPath indexPathForItem:5 inSection:0]
                           atScrollPosition:UICollectionViewScrollPositionCenteredVertically animated:NO];
  }];

Once I have a reproduction case, I will make it a top priority to ensure this is fixed.  Sadly I may need to release 1.9.4 without this, because 1.9.3 has a few bugs that are more serious than this (at least, judging by the fact that several people have reported them, whereas this still-extremely-serious bug looks to be affecting fewer people as it is the first report).  I think this is the most urgent bug in the framework right now, so you have my commitment to work through a solution - both short-term (hopefully an elegant workaround), and long-term (structural / architectural improvements that also eliminate the conditions that made this bug possible).

Let me know if you have any tips on a change I can make to any one of the example projects to trigger this!
",appleguy,knopp
1011,2015-12-30 07:22:19,"@knopp I'm going to hold the release one final day - in part so I can conduct additional testing tomorrow, but primarily for this issue (it's the last one in the 1.9.4 milestone).  If you are able to describe a code change (or upload a small patch file) to apply to one of the ASDK example apps, which I think should be possible to use as a base to trigger what you've found, that would be tremendously helpful to enable the solution making 1.9.4 (I have a long drive to family's house tomorrow so it won't be a full day for me).

That said, don't worry if you're not available or can't seem to get it to reproduce — we can let 1.9.4 go with this issue, and I will immediately proceed to work on the more structural improvements.  Note however that there may not be another release until a 2.0 Beta in mid-late January which could contain some other risky changes such as the +Beta.h mode I referenced.  I will roll a 1.9.5 if any other bugs are found with 1.9.4 that warrant a special release on the stable 1.9.x branch.  2.0 is in a holding pattern until documentation is ready, but that work has been started recently, so I expect 2.0 to go GM in late January or February.
",appleguy,knopp
1011,2015-12-30 12:03:04,"@appleguy, this doesn't seem easily reproducible. Possible reason is that I have quite a lot of items, so the collection view is loaded progressively. But I think this is what's happening:
1. `reloadDataWithCompletion` is called
2. First collection view items are created, displayed and set to visible (`[ASRangeController _updateVisibleNodeIndexPath]`)
3. `ASDataController` adds more items, causing `_rangeIsValid` set to `NO` in `ASRangeController` (in `[ASRangeController dataController:didInsertNodes:atIndexPaths:withAnimationOptions:]`
4. `reloadDataWithCompletion` finally calls the completion block, which triggers scrolling

now because of (3), `_rangeIsValid` is set to `NO`, and `ASRangeController _updateVisibleNodeIndexPaths` will not do anything about `removedIndexPaths`, due to the line below



The important part here is that some items already need to be visible, while data controller is adding more items.
",knopp,appleguy
1011,2015-12-31 00:00:35,"@knopp ok, that's very helpful context.  Questions then:
- What index paths are you scrolling to?  The batch size is roughly 10 items, so I assume you are scrolling to an index path greater than 10 at a minimum?
- I can take a pass at fixing this, but without a way to reproduce and confirm the fix, I wouldn't be comfortable including it in 1.9.4 - since any change to this code is fairly risky, I want to be certain that it does indeed address a known issue and then would feel the risk is appropriate.

I'm writing up the release notes now for 1.9.4 and want to start the ASRangeController rewrite tonight (for a later release).  Let me know if you happen across a way to reproduce, even if it doesn't happen 100% of the time, say by making a test project have 1000 items and scrolling to item 900 or something.
",appleguy,knopp
1011,2015-12-31 00:55:36,"@appleguy, it is probably around a hundred, so it is done in multiple batches. 

I completely agree that this shouldn't go into 1.9.4 without proper test case. The behavior is very consistent in my project, but it is not easily extractable. Is there any point in actually trying to build a test case for this if you're going to rewrite ASRangeController anyway? I'm currently a bit behind schedule with the project, however if there are similar issues after the rewrite I'll do my best to provide a test case to reproduce this. Knowing which nodes exactly are visible is very important for our usecase, since visible nodes trigger/schedule expensive server side processing (and when nodes get hidden the processing is stopped/cancelled)
",knopp,appleguy
1011,2015-12-31 01:45:02,"@knopp ok, thanks for your input - I really appreciate it!  Knowing that the visibility notifications are key for your use case is very motivating for me to get this working for you, so thanks for sharing those details about your project :).  I am quite excited to ensure that the ASDK architecture makes it easier for your app + backend implementation to have sophisticated, optimized runtime behaviors.

Regarding the test case, I do think it would be quite valuable to have a reproduction because that code would then belong in the unit test suite for ASRangeController and/or components based on it (helping validate the new implementation too).

Do you have a workaround for this?  If so, don't concern yourself with the test case in the near term, and good luck focusing on your key milestones!  After a couple weeks, if you get time to put together a test that fails for 1.9.4 but (hopefully passes) for current master at that time, that would be a really fantastic contribution.

",appleguy,tomizimobile
1009,2015-12-29 03:08:41,"Woah, thanks @Adlai-Holler!!  Even just getting this started is **huge**.  I have a handful of comparably risky / ambitious changes planned for right after 1.9.4 is cut (any day now, for reals :) ), and will keep running Pinterest internal against the latest to get us fairly substantial test coverage on these things.  @lappp9 has the programming guide / 2.0 documentation underway, and we plan to add more tests soon too.

We should catch up soon about one of the most important use cases in the framework: ASDataController / ASRangeController and its possible successors / improvements.  Most relevant to this, I want to remove the current checks for isNodeLoaded doing main thread measurement, and I also want things like reloadSection to first process the new state and then apply the updates rather than deleting the existing one initially and then adding the replacement when it's done.

Somewhat more tangentially, there's also my upcoming change to support a ""cellNodeBlock"" so that the block can capture call-time data state and yet be used to allocate the cell node on a background thread, along with the allocation range / measurement range / virtualization stuff we discussed (in service of the need to measure only slightly more than is required to populate a given rect, allowing more liberal use of synchronously preparing those areas).

But lastly and also relevant to the idea of a transactional system we might expand here, there is the increasingly-essential (for my use cases at least) concept of transparent ""runloop amortization"", where the materialization of views and layers is spread out over multiple runloop turns to allow the system opportunities to service display link timers (physics-based animations) or gestures or network callbacks.  This is tricky because it will also involve applying the properties to those views and we can't allow the sub-hierarchy onscreen until it is fully materialized, even if a later call does force it to be.  It will be most useful when the ASRangeController has a cell node entering the display range, or a view controller wants to pre-load its contents, but once the cell is visible or the controller is being presented it is too late to use this technique (unlike synchronous concurrency, which blocks main on a concurrent background operation).  So we will need the ability to force-finish in one runloop an operation that is in the process of being amortized across multiple loops, and that's where waiting on a transaction type setup (calling ""run"" or ""finish"" on the transaction, perhaps, if the contents of that transaction is responsible for poking the view / layer and applying pending state).

Rambling complete, I'm now leaving the Chipotle in Central California (Grapevine, CA) to continue the drive home to SoCal :).  Hope to see you again soon - I'll be online and working for the next week if you want to talk by FaceTime Audio about this.  Thanks for the delightful surprise and ideas to think about on the drive!
",appleguy,Adlai-Holler
1009,2016-01-04 18:39:50,"Hey @appleguy just wanted to let you know I haven't forgotten or bailed on this! I think about it on the daily but I haven't yet set aside the time to bang it out. I'll execute on it before Friday.

Most of my musing has been about run loop amortization. What do your use cases look like? Are you thinking of We could make a generalized controller that amortizes an array of main-queue-only blocks by, say, running max 5 blocks per turn. The downside here is that the controller has no idea how much work each block contains, so 5 blocks could mean 1000 units of work or 10. Would it be worthwhile to let the client provide an optional `cost` param? Probably not. It's a small downside though, since it's a private class so we'll be able to tune performance for our use cases anyway.

Or we could make a specialized controller, that uses knowledge about the work itself to decide how to divide the work up. I don't really like this idea but I want to throw it out. This would basically merge the run-loop amortization code with the property buffering code, and decide how to break up the work based on ""which nodes' properties to push per turn of the run loop.""

As for transactionalizing and flushing this stuff if we run out of time, am I understanding it right that the transaction would contain `[node flushPendingState]` i.e we may actually apply changes that were made outside of our transaction ""block""? It seems like we have to accept this, because the alternative is storing separate pending states for separate transactions :scream:.

Want to talk data controller & range controller this week? I could do Wednesday or Friday morning/afternoon.

As you can see if you look into git log on the collection or table components, I'm hacking there in rolling intervals, so this isn't too much of a diversion from my planned work.

I also notice the flashing upon reloading the first section when scrolled down.  Some of that may be fixable; some might be inherent with what the user is requesting.  We may want to default-on neverShowPlaceholders in those cases when content is onscreen, which is certainly what UIKit does; we have the advantage of approximately half the main thread blocking time in such a situation, as -recursivelyEnsureDisplaySynchronously:YES will simply pause the main thread waiting on a multithreaded background operation that processes the layout and display for each item independently.

985,2015-12-25 05:50:15,"@levi Definitely interested to look to Apple APIs for comparison / precedent.  CALayer's delegate is set to UIView when attached to a view, but this is prominently documented (in UIView) - and more importantly, the CALayer delegate has essentially no functionality that can't be handled in UIView itself (https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/QuartzCore/Reference/CALayerDelegate_protocol/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012871)  Also, UIView and CALayer are very similar objects conceptually, so subclassing one and doing the operations there is not as strange or unexpected as requiring the implementation be in a different type of object (ASViewController vs ASDisplayNode).

I just tried it, but I cannot access `self.layer.shadowPath` from `init*`. This is probably because the layer isn't created at that point... so where's a good place to place that line of code?

979,2015-12-23 23:19:19,"@fatuhoku indeed using .cornerRadius even on a plain CALayer will typically have very, very poor performance on any device older than an iPhone 5S.

One of the simplest options is to use imageModificationBlock.  Look into the framework's implementation of ASImageNodeRoundBorderModificationBlock() for an example of implementing such a block.  I would love to add this more natively to the framework but haven't had time; that block doesn't support clipping for rounded corners, but we should add one that does (feel free to submit a PR - or just use it yourself locally).

In Pinterest we have a node that can efficiently and dynamically round any type of content if it is on an opaque background.  The imageModificationBlock technique has the advantage that it works on any background, even if the background behind the image is changing dynamically.

Lastly - it may not be appropriate in all use cases, but you can also try enabling .shouldRasterizeDescendants either on the imageNode itself or on any parent of that node.  That should solve your issue, but isn't a good technique to use if there are multiple small images loading that could cause the entire hierarchy to re-rasterize if any of them change (like several loading individually in sequence).  This is a pretty good option to use if you just set it on the imageNode directly.  In the case of rasterizing, you can use the node.cornerRadius property as you are currently, and it will just be handled much more efficiently.

977,2016-03-20 05:53:50,"@zintus thank goodness, the new threading model has been landed for a while now and has proven to be quite stable even with extensive usage!

Although I am not certain if this is 100% supported yet, in the very very near future it should be possible to have even loaded no it hierarchies be measured off the main thread by ASDataController.  In fact, we are using this capability in Pinterest - asynchronous measurement of loaded node hierarchies, with an animated transition being triggered at the moment that the measurement completes. This system has been constructed with thread safety front and center, so that even a call to -setNeedsLayout in the middle of the asynchronous measurement phase or the transition itself is handled consistently.

That support is relatively new, although also enjoying widespread use in a very stressful use case at Pinterest (multiple calls to -transition potentially before the prior finishes, due to various updates coming in to the underlying app / server data model).  The one part that I am not as certain of is, if the transition API is not use directly as is the case for the data controller, can we remove the support for main thread layout of loaded nodes?

@nguyenhuy wouldn't know the answer to this question, and although it Would take us at least a couple weeks to investigate, I think that will be the ultimate fix here...rather than supporting more easily creating dual-path code intending to support the previous, rather frustrating threading model.

Just as a quick note, it is still not thread safe to read properties that are bridged to the system objects off of the main thread, after the backing system objects are created. There is no plan to support this in the near future, although it might be possible with further sophistication in the pending state... The reason is that in my many years of using this framework, I have found that it is always quite easy to avoid relying on this capability.  Paper had a write-from-background threading model supported in its version of the framework, but I was always able to ensure that Reading from the background was avoided by providing other facilities (e.g. instead of self.bounds, look at constrainedSize).

973,2015-12-22 18:10:17,"After a quick debugging, it turns out that you need to have a separate inspector class, because both `ASCollectionViewLayoutInspecting` and `ASCollectionViewDataSource` protocols declare `collectionView:constrainedSizeForNodeAtIndexPath:`. So if a class conforms to both protocols and provides a zero constrained size, that size will be picked up by `ASCollectionView` ([code](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/937b72b64a01d1735052e8b49acf73959b4d3844/AsyncDisplayKit/ASCollectionView.mm#L671)) and thus all cell nodes will be measured using the invalid size.

@levi Is there anything we can do to avoid this kind of mistake? Like having `ASCollectionViewLayoutInspecting` to require a method with a slightly different signature?

@fatuhoku You may want to take a look at the `MosaicCollectionViewLayout` in CustomCollectionView example. It produces a Pinterest-like layout that is pretty close to what you are trying to achieve with `SelfSizingWaterfallCollectionViewLayout`. For difficulties building a custom collection view layout, definitely ask @levi. He is the expert :)

973,2015-12-23 20:17:09,"Okay @levi, I think this is best marked as a duplicate of #954 — I need the cells to size themselves, without the need for an external mechanism. The inspector sorts of ends up having to do size calculations outside of the `ASLayout` and `ASLayoutSpec` mechanism.  This causes duplication of layout logic and is no better than UIKit currently.

The real question is, is there a way to do this without necessarily re-implementing what UIKit introduced in the form of `estimatedItemSize`?
",fatuhoku,levi
973,2015-12-24 10:15:48,"@fatuhoku the cells do in fact size themselves, the layout inspector class only provides the constrained size for the cells to measure within. The layoutSpecThatFits: functional is still very much available for your supplementary nodes.

Maybe you could paste what you're looking to accomplish and I can help you define what a custom layout inspector looks like?
",levi,fatuhoku
973,2016-01-11 15:19:43,"@levi The `CustomCollectionView` example doesn't actually demonstrate self-sizing, because:
1. In `MosaicCollectionViewLayout`, it requires relies on a delegate object to get the image's original size, so that the height can be calculated from the fixed cell width and aspect ratio.
2. `ImageCellNode` assumes that the only contents of the cell is an `ImageNode` and nothing else. If we introduce, say, a `ASStackLayoutSpec` that stacks an image on top of text in there and run the example, MosaicCollectionViewLayout actually knows nothing about the newly added `ASTextNode`, and therefore fails to lay things out properly.

I expect that ASDK should use the cell's layout specs to drive the `UICollectionViewLayout`.  This simply isn't done at the moment, and I think it still occurs on the main thread. Am I right?

Basically I'm looking to create more or less the behaviour of the infinite scrolling home page of Pinterest — each item has an image (with its own aspect ratio), its own description and caption. These nodes are stacked together to give the height of the cell.

@yury there is not currently a layoutSpec method on ASViewController - this will be added soon, but in the meantime you must subclass the node that you provide to ASVC.  This is the same as how UIViewController started out, where for 4 or 5 years the iOS API did not provide -viewDidLayoutSubviews and it wasn't possible to implement layout in a view controller without doing it in an usual place like -viewWillAppear:.

This work perfectly for ASViewController if you want to do something like initWithNode:[[ASDisplayNode alloc] init].  You can add subnodes (or better yet, do self.node.usesImplicitHierarchyManagement = YES), then provide the layout spec block (typically best to define this in -init).

The only trick is that this cannot be used with any class that defines -layoutSpecThatFits as a method.  This does limit the usefulness quite a bit, so we have an important task on the team roadmap already to address this by allowing any two layout spec definitions to both apply themselves.

I haven't looked at it in detail yet, but I'm wondering if it is necessary for them to be skipped and if we absolutely need new API or if we can just allow them to be respected while still handling the entire multi-styled substring as a link if it is so attributed.
",appleguy,samhsiung
967,2015-12-22 06:43:40,"@appleguy We are using `NSLayoutManager` from TextKit to render text which has a hard coded internal color for hyperlinks which ignores `NSForegroundColorAttributeName`.

> NSLayoutManager has a internal color hard-coded for glyph ranges belonging to a hyperlink. It ignores the NSForegroundColorAttributeName, we believe wrongfully so. All drawing functions are called with the CGContext already configured by layout manager. This includes setting the fill color for the glyphs.

In the writeup above, they were able to work around this behaviour by subclassing `NSLayoutManager` and overriding `showCGGlyphs...`



We could do something similar if we wanted to support using `NSForegroundColorAttributeName` for ranges with `NSLinkAttributeName` set without adding a new API.

In CSS, if a color is specified for a selector, it won't apply to any links under selected elements. There has to be a specific rule targeting links in order to style them. Perhaps Apple wanted to mirror the way link styling is handled in CSS.

967,2016-04-01 06:37:41,"@bsmith11 - we did fix the color issue and it should now respect that attribute.

You labeled the problem correctly - creating the view there is a no-go.  However it's not immediately clear to me where / how you are using the size, and so therefore why it is actually necessary to create the view at that point.  Could you clarify that a bit just so I can be confident to implement a solution that addresses your use case as well as the one I have in mind for Pinterest?

966,2015-12-23 06:08:04,"@KieranLafferty ok, we're getting somewhere.  I am actively working in this area and should have a solution for you in the next two weeks, hopefully sooner, but I don't want to over-promise either!

Can you email me at asyncdisplaykit@gmail.com so we can communicate more quickly / easily?

If you are able to do a really really basic sketch or color-block prototype of the look you're looking for (maybe that is what is in this sample project, if the crash were bypassed?), that would help.  The reason is that I need a degree of understanding around what point at which is right to trigger the internal collection view's /actual/ main thread layout pass.

The system I'm building will have an API that is basically like -measureEnoughCellsToFillEntireRect:, and then actually stop measuring after that point (or at least unblock the call), allowing the collection / table to come onscreen and be told about only the minimum number of index paths to satisfy that request and thus minimize the amount of main thread churning it does (even though the measurements will be cached, there is still nontrivial overhead especially to UICollectionView's layout attributes).  This will then pair excellently with .neverShowPlaceholders = YES.

My question is essentially: will the interior collection views be able to be scrolled onscreen rapidly with smooth scrolling, or is it in a pagination-style scenario?  If paginating, is ASPagerNode appropriate?  The API I'm working on will shine most with UINavigationController, UITabBarController, ASPagerNode, and also horizontally scrolling elements embedded in vertical scrolling ones.

An alternate take on this which I think is what you might be looking for: -measureAllCellsAndSetOrReturnContentSize.  Thanks for sharing as much info as you can so I can ensure both the API and implementation is suitable!

965,2016-04-01 04:01:54,"@KieranLafferty sorry for the lag - this is now radically better in the current version.

I suggest you use ASStackLayoutSpecs for the ""inner collection views"" - you can even make each item in the stacks or stack of stacks if a grid, be an ASCellNode as there is no restriction on using ASCellNodes inside one another or even outside of tables / collections.

964,2015-12-21 16:29:41,"Hey @levi, this is awesome. Can't wait to use this. Just curious on why collection node's reload methods are substantially more expensive than UICollectionViews? Is this because there is a extra layer going through the node?
",aaronschubert0,levi
964,2015-12-22 04:02:54,"@aaronschubert0 it's because the nodes are destroyed and re-created.  Granted, nodes are cheap to allocate, and even in the case of a full reloadData, it doesn't force layout / height calculations (table) or size calculations (collection) to be done synchronously.  In addition to not forcing them synchronously, they are done concurrently on multiple cores with ASDK.  So as long as you don't call -reloadDataImmediately, it should actually be faster than UIKit to call -reloadData on an ASCollectionView if your cells have any amount of dynamic sizing (such as checking the size of text).

There is a /lot/ of documentation that is still needed for AsyncDisplayKit to help communicate these many details, but it's just been a tradeoff of either writing the code to make the framework that much more advanced, or stopping work to describe what has been done :-P

As for the flickering, I think you might be right about view controllers swapping, I'll try a custom view controller transition, it can maybe fix this flicker. I was also thinking about overlaying the image view controller on tap with its on image view and then do the transition by either hiding or changing the alpha as you suggested. This way, maybe, I can avoid the whole mess I made in the image view controller.

955,2015-12-18 23:42:21,"@smyrgl are you setting a decoded image on the image node?  If so, ASDK has no way to release memory without completely losing the reference to the image.  It is absolutely essential that you set coded / compressed images (e.g. created from a UIImage created from JPEG NSData off the network, or a UIImage created from a PNG on disk, etc).
",appleguy,smyrgl
955,2015-12-19 02:03:49,"@appleguy I'm using WebP encoded images so I don't really have a choice but to use decoded images since ImageIO doesn't support WebP.

What's your suggestion for working around this?  I suppose I could convert them into JPEG before sticking them into my image cache (I'm using a local image cache instead of NSURLCache for image caching) but if there's another way it would be good to avoid this step.  I'd like to continue to use WebP on the wire for the size improvements.
",smyrgl,appleguy
955,2015-12-19 04:09:38,"@smyrgl ah, very cool.  It should work quite well if you want to implement a subclass to ASImageNode or ASNetworkImageNode.  Check out this method in the ASDisplayNode+Subclasses.h header, and look at the implementation of ASImageNode:
- (UIImage *)displayWithParameters:(id<NSObject>)parameters
                     isCancelled:(asdisplaynode_iscancelled_block_t)isCancelledBlock;

But yeah, it's definitely going to be a sad day if you are providing fully decoded images to ASDK.  You certainly could locally re-encode them, but that's going to be phenomenally expensive.  I'd be interested in merging in support for WebP even if it required adding a weak_framework that folks could optionally link to have support for that.  I believe this is how PINRemoteImage supports a few extra things like FLAnimatedImage and I think it supports WebP too.

In the next couple months we are going to do a deep integration between PINRemoteImage and AsyncDisplayKit, thus supporting this, but it's a ways out still...
",appleguy,smyrgl
955,2015-12-19 21:06:41,"@appleguy I'm familiar with the implementation details of ASImageNode so I could do what you are suggesting but just to verify how this might work let me list out my understanding of what the problem is:
- ASImageNode works by holding a strong reference to the UIImage and then drawing it in `displayWithParameters:` by creating a draw context and drawing it using `drawInRect:`.  This works because encoded images have a `CGImageSource` backing which doesn't keep the actual image data in memory.
- However if the UIImage is already decoded then its underlying data isn't lazily fetched from disk but rather is kept in memory and will not free the memory until the ASImageNode itself is destroyed.  In a Table/Collection view this is pretty much never since the `ASDataController` holds onto its nodes even if they aren't in the display range.
- This could be resolved a number of ways but the simplest seems to be to create a subclass of `ASImageNode` that overrides `drawParametersForAsyncLayer:` and then returns the `_ASImageNodeDrawParameters` which will include the decoded image only at that point which could be built from a new param that is added (such as a cacheKey or fileURL).  Since the node itself doesn't keep a reference to the decoded image this should be fine and the decoded image memory should be freed as soon as `displayWithParameters:` is finished.

Do I have that right?

I'd like to suggest that this is not just a problem with WebP--although `ASImageNode` has the `imageModificationBlock` property I'm sure a lot of people might be doing things like tinting and corner rounding before setting the image property of a node which is going to trigger this issue.  The `ASButtonNode` class for example is practically begging for this to be the case since the biggest use case for different images for different control states is image tints and that will trigger this issue right there.  If you image an `ASButtonNode` being used in a Table/Collection view...well  you get the idea.  This is a memory nightmare waiting to happen.

I realize that this is ultimately a problem with the way UIImage abstracts ImageIO but it just seems very dangerous to me for unsuspecting users.  I don't see a lot of good options for solving this universally without drastic changes but I suspect a lot of users are seeing this issue without knowing it and that it can be a really crippling issue in the context of a Table/Collection view.
",smyrgl,appleguy
955,2015-12-20 04:44:14,"@smyrgl Yes, you have a detailed understanding of the issue.  Especially bullet point #2 - by design, ASDataController holds onto a large number of nodes, as they serve as the vessel that holds cached layout information (specifically calculatedLayout).  It is intended that after calling /both/ -clearContents and -clearFetchedData, that the memory footprint of nodes is very small.  This is true for most normal ASNetworkImageNodes and ASMultiplexImageNodes as they can even go re-fetch the data from cache or the downloader...but disastrously non-true if users are directly setting large decoded buffers themselves.

Because I have not actually imagined the utility / reasoning behind setting decoded buffers on ASImageNode, it escaped me entirely until recently that this is a clear and serious pitfall for public users.  Trivial to fix for most cases, but also just as easy to commit the mistake without even realizing it.  I realized this about 1 month ago and haven't yet had time to think in detail about a solution.

One mitigation that I have thought about, which is not satisfying, is to detect if a large ratio of the images set on ASImageNodes are in fact decoded.  This would be an excellent indicator to throw a loud warning / possibly even assert (in DEBUG of course) that the framework is in an unhealthy state of usage.

Regarding your third bullet point, there I'm not as confident you are correct, but I may not completely understand what you mean.  The upshot is that it is essential that the range-driven calls for fetchData, display (which does trigger the async draw parameters call), clearContents, and clearFetchedData properly handle image memory.  The fetch data calls obviously are intended to load /and free/ in-memory compressed image data; the display / clearContents calls are intended to do the same for uncompressed data, managed internally by ASDK.  In this golden state, users have a great deal of control over the memory footprint and runtime characteristics of the framework via the rangeTuningParameters.

@smyrgl I'm really glad to have an engineer as senior as yourself considering this challenge.  If you have any ideas / suggestions for how safeguards can be put in place, even if you aren't able to implement them yourself, please do share and I will work to prioritize them over the holidays.  Diffs will be eagerly collaborated on if you do want to take a pass at it :).

955,2015-12-21 21:49:25,"@appleguy Thanks for the vote of confidence, I want to finish some investigation before I comment further--I have a few ideas I'm looking at for how to solve this and I need to dig deeper into them before I can say definitively one way or the other what the best course is going to be.  And you can pretty much ignore my point 3...that was purely an attempt to suggest a way to resolve the specific problem OUTSIDE of ADK...I'm pretty convinced that this needs to be resolved as a patch to ADK for this to work now.

This is my top priority right now so I should have an update in the next couple of days.
",smyrgl,appleguy
955,2015-12-22 05:13:15,"@smyrgl update on my side.  I dove into ImageIO and have been pretty desperately trying to figure out the best way to determine if an image is compressed or not.  The sad news is that I am pretty sure it can't be done in a practical way without access to the original data - you can go down a weird path with CGDataProvider but that doesn't seem to always work either, but better than that is to inspect the actual NSData using CGImageSource.

I'm thinking of changing the Downloader and Cache protocols to return NSData in their completion blocks rather than CGImageRef.  This could be done as a breaking change for the 2.0 API for anyone who is not using ASBasicImageDownloader, which would certainly be one way to ensure that everyone is using the framework as intended.  We could inspect the NSDatas in DEBUG mode to ensure they are compressed, and if almost all are decompressed, we know something funny is going on (like a user getting the data out of an image after another library decompresses it).

Really though, I want to get the PINRemoteImage integration accomplished.  PIRI supports WebP, but also Progressive JPEG, GIF, etc...and ASDK absolutely needs a ""1st party""-quality image downloader and decoding suite.  @Adlai-Holler has done a lot of work on ASMultiplexImageNode recently and might have some further thoughts here.

One last thing - the implementation of ASImageNode's async draw method can be significantly improved for the case where a decoded image IS provided.  It was much more efficient for the version used by Paper.  The current version is using UIGraphics contexts regardless of the incoming image, since we can't check if it is decoded.  If it is decoded, we can use the image directly as the contents (potentially setting contentsCenter / contentsRect if necessary) to reduce by approximately half the memory consumed (depends on how much upscaling / downscaling is currently being done by allocating the new buffer of exactly the right size).

There's a great deal more that can be done with image handling; for example the Paper version would decode images at native size if they were smaller than the area to be shown in, rather than drawing them at the final size; if they were larger than the ideal size, it would redraw them into the ideal size to save memory.  Very simple and clearly just the beginning compared to using progressive JPEG to its fullest potential, supporting awesome fading transitions (the current placeholderFadesOut option is pretty shady), etc.
",appleguy,smyrgl
955,2015-12-28 21:15:42,"@appleguy The holidays kind of threw this off for me but my findings were the same--there just doesn't seem to be a great way to tell if an image is decoded (that seems to be the whole point actually...).  It is possible to resolve this by using a custom image buffer abstraction that is different than UIImage but that doesn't seem to be the most elegant solution.  

I do think that working on this from the ASImageNode side seems to be the best approach but it isn't bulletproof since we still need a way to cache the images so they don't need to be kept in memory.  I am still working on a few workarounds but I don't have anything solid yet.
",smyrgl,appleguy
955,2016-01-04 05:58:24,"@appleguy So one thing I've been playing with--what about implementing our own buffer in the setter on an `ASImageNode` that discards the `UIImage` and just keeps a reference to the buffer object?  Something like this (simplistic example):



This could then be purged during `clearContents` on the node in question which would cleanup the temp file.  Not an ideal solution but it works.  

EDIT: The idea here is to maintain compatibility with UIImage...if we are willing to discard that then the options increase dramatically...also if there is some magical way to deduce if a UIImage is decoded or not that also helps.  The problem with this solution I see is the duplication which is tough to work around since I'm not aware of an easy way to keep hashes of image data.  Typically the hash value of an image is the same as the image bytes themselves...

955,2016-03-19 01:07:31,"@smyrgl we now support PINRemoteImage and so this issue is resolved by default.

I will keep this issue open to add support for webP, and we should separately revisit whether there is a way to detect that a developer's custom downloader set up is erroneously providing decoded images to the framework.

At the moment, I am not aware of the way to reliably detect whether an image reference is decoded or not. Please let me know if you can think of a way to do this.  cc @garrettmoon, @maicki

I actually arrived at the idea that you probably had to 'pre-measure' the cells but was completely stuck as to how to achieve it, especially while not losing the performance properties of ASDK.

If nodes are instantiated, does the act of pre-measuring the nodes actually instantiate Views or CALayers at all? It shouldn't, right?

Thanks!

P.S. what's the relationship between the proposed method, and the way UIKit was extended with self-sizing in iOS 8? What I'm seeing is, you'll need some sort of prototype cell that gets configured with some data, it gets measured, and then the computed frame gets cached.

954,2016-03-08 07:48:50,"@fatuhoku I wanted my cells to have the same UI as what you described originally, an image with text below it. And I think I might have figured out a solution. I have not done any instrumentation to measure the performance though.

For the sample project, in MosaicCollectionViewLayout, in the _itemSizeAtIndexPath method, I added an estimated height of my text plus any desired padding to the return value, say 100. In prepareLayout method, I queried for the ASCellNode the same way you did and used its calculatedSize property instead of the size retrieved from _itemSizeAtIndexPath method. 

In ImageCellNode, I added an ASTextNode and configured it as desired. In the calculateSizeThatFits method, I subtracted the estimated text height of 100 from the passed in constrainedSize. I then measured the _imageNode and the _textNode. The height of the of the returned CGSize was the addition of the two node's heights.

The catch to this whole ""solution"" is that I am not sure that ALL of the nodes would be measured by the time they are accessed in prepareLayout. I believe they would be, but I have not looked at the underlying implementation to be 100% sure.

Lastly, the performance problem you were seeing during scrolling is because in MosaicCollectionViewLayout, the shouldInvalidateLayoutForBoundsChange method was returning YES when you scroll, which causes prepareLayout to get called over and over. Change that method to always return NO. The code to handle screen size (orientation) changes should probably be in the view controller's viewWillTransitionToSize method. 

Hope that helps and is a good way of doing things. As a disclaimer, I am still new to ASDK and UICollectionView.

@levi in what context would this happen? My understanding is that ASCollectionView only inserts cells after the the node for the index path has been setup and measured by its dataController (usually on a background thread). This all happens through the ASRangeController delegate methods [here](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/AsyncDisplayKit/ASCollectionView.mm#L964). Any call to insert, update or delete items will then trigger a re-layout of the collection view and prepareLayout will be called again. In fact, calling numberOfSections: and numberOfItemsInSection: on ASCollectionView will only return the number of items and sections that have been loaded (and measured) by the dataController [here](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/AsyncDisplayKit/ASCollectionView.mm#L520), not the number returned by asyncDatasource

I'm thinking we will have a play-in-place mode that doesn't right away have support for a full scrubber control, but also offer a fullscreen mode backed by the existing UIKit media player.  The core value proposition would be efficient async fetchData / display range support for the thumbnail image as well as smoothly triggering autoplay upon the Visible .interfaceState (if some property like .autoplay = YES).

",appleguy,lappp9
952,2015-12-19 19:21:38,"Woot! This is an excellent first pass and I can't wait to put this component to good work. Since @appleguy already covered the implementation, and since I'm greedy, this will basically amount to feature requests :smile: . Playing video in iOS, the complexity can skyrocket really quickly, so I'm not necessarily pushing for all these immediately.

Muting/unmuting audio. This would mean adding a `muted` property to the node, and applying that to the latest player whenever either changes. If we add a delegate callback (or KVO but… eh…) for observing mutedness then users can implement their own mute/unmute toggle button. Giving them a default mute/unmute button sounds noble but would need a lot more consideration of value.

It would be valuable to detect when the video has reached the end time – here are a couple ways to pull it off:
- Make `currentItem` public, and client observes `AVPlayerItemDidPlayToEndTimeNotification`. Pro: very little code on our end, consistent with non-ASDK usage. Con: Need to inform client when player item changes, may be cumbersome for user to handle the common use case of ""I don't care what item is playing, I want to know when this node finishes playing.""
- Create a delegate method for it. Pro: Very little code on client's end, could even have a `shouldAutorepeat` option for the delegate to make the call, we are already observing the AVFoundation notification internally anyway. Con: none, really. 

I think the best approach is actually to do both of the above. I can't think of a reason to hide the player item. Clients may want to seek to a particular point, configure the audio mix, etc. There's so much functionality that we could safely offer users, that it might be worth informing the delegate when the current item changes so that they can configure it, or providing a `playerItemConfigurationBlock`.

Looking to the future, helping to handle buffering would be a great feature – perhaps by default showing/hiding the spinner during buffering and informing the delegate so they can handle it in other ways if desired. Observing a combination of `AVPlayerItemPlaybackStalledNotification`, `AVPlayer.rate`, `AVPlayerItem.playbackBufferEmpty`, and `AVPlayerItem.playbackLikelyToKeepUp`.

952,2015-12-21 07:31:05,"@Adlai-Holler, so I was wondering about the muting thing.  Would it make sense to add an enum property for what the tap action is supposed to trigger? It could be playVideo, playAudio and goFullscreen. Or something like that?

952,2015-12-25 23:43:34,"@lappp9 I think using an enum to control the behavior is a little too much at this early stage. The more I think about it, the more I think that we should leave all tap handling up to the consumer including the play/pause behavior that's already wired up.

My rationale is, I expect practically all consumers to subclass `ASVideoNode` and add a bunch of other functionality to suit their needs. So giving them this one trivial piece (tap -> play/pause) may interfere with their intended tap handling, and it'd be very easy for them to replicate if the want it. Adding the enum you mentioned is a bit over-engineered, and it still won't alleviate the need for the consumer to subclass.

952,2015-12-28 06:02:29,"@lappp9 very excited to merge this in the coming weeks!  I had a chance to play with both test projects today.  A few bits of feedback:
- Make sure to use https URLs in both projects as they are triggering ATS.
- Rename the scrolling sample to something more descriptive of its purpose, rather than the actor in the sample video :)
- Consider merging both projects and using a simple UITabBarController or similar for the stationary + scrolling view.  This would help us test things like auto-pause when the view controller goes offscreen (visibility notifications are new to ASDK and so may not always work as expected right now - we should audit this behavior carefully and skeptically)
- Briefly refactor the test project code to minimize duplication from the Kittens app, removing anything not necessary and renaming things that still have Kittens in the name
- Different route, but one that is interesting: delete the test projects entirely and instead adopt ASVideoNode in several existing test apps.  Kittens app could have rows with full-width videos and no text, sized to fit the aspect ratio of the video correctly (find any kitten clip on the internet that is fairly short so it doesn't take a long time to load and seem slow - roughly correct resolution for an iPhone).  SocialAppLayout could have a video type, and you could modify the data source to add more stories (even if they just repeat over and over) to be able to do faster scrolling tests.  One of the best ones would be CustomCollectionView, as it is looking like it will be one of a handful of example apps that we will keep at the top level as a true reference app for people to look at (along with SocialAppLayout once its code is cleaned up, plus whatever new app is done for the guide).
- Not critical for the initial landing, but make a note to add a snapshot test (needs to use a local file URL / can't depend on network) hat checks the placeholder frame state, and also manually seeks forward to the last frame when in the playing state to check that frame.

950,2015-12-19 04:15:01,"@KieranLafferty Hey there - this should definitely be solvable.  If you could share at least a memory profile, that would be super helpful.  Much better yet, I'd be able to work very quickly to come to a solution with you if you'd be willing to share the code.  I'll keep it confidential and private if you're willing to email it to asyncdisplaykit@gmail.com, and will give you my iMessage for coordination.

Anyway, allocating nodes should be extremely cheap - cheaper even than allocating layers, and well over an order of magnitude cheaper than views.  They should only take a few hundred bytes each, not even a few kilobytes.  So it should absolutely not cause memory problems simply to load the nodes.

Things to check for:

**\* Make sure you are not accessing the .view property in the -init method of the node classes, nor doing anything related to UIKit (gesture recognizers, etc).  Move all that stuff to the -didLoad method.

**\* Be careful what you load in -fetchData, as this range is fairly large by default (I think about 3 screens).  Feel free to change the size of the range with setTuningParameters:forRangeType:.

**\* Make sure you do not provide decoded images to ASImageNode or ASNetworkImageNode, and let them do their own loading rather than kicking off image loads & decodes for everything up front.

Please let me know your findings / progress as I want to be certain you solve this issue.  There should not be any particularly difficult hurdle to ensuring that memory is very responsibly managed with AsyncDisplayKit.

Said another way: if you have accessed the .view or .layer property of a node, as happens if it is visible onscreen, after that point you **cannot set UIView / CALayer properties on a background thread**.

For the vast majority of apps / architectures, this isn't a problem to avoid.  If you are wondering how to achieve a certain effect or implementation and aren't sure how to do it, let's discuss the details here!
",appleguy,vikas4goyal
934,2016-04-01 07:58:56,"@vikas4goyal - great question! Also sorry for the delay, it's been a busy few months. 

Nearly all properties required by the framework are thread safe and do not create the underlying view object. The only exceptions are special wrapper nodes, such as ASEditableTextNode and ASMapNode, which provide a property for their special view type, but of course these are still direct access to the views. 

That said, the behavior has been significantly upgraded and we now support completely thread safe property writing from background threads, even to view and layer bridged properties. 

You still must not use the view or layer itself, or set properties on it directly from background threads. But if you do so through the node properties, these will be automatically transactionalized and applied on the main thread in an efficient manner. As always, you can set these properties even before the node loads and it will not trigger creation of the view. But the new behavior is that you can still set these bridge properties in the background even after the view or layer has been loaded. 

All that said, it is still not possible to synchronously read the value of a bridged property from a background thread after the view or layer has loaded. 

So for example, setting the attributedString of an ASTextNode from a background thread is always safe and will never trigger the node to load. 

If you are curious about how this behavior works, look into ASPendingStateController and _ASPendingState. 

Feel free to reopen the issue if you have questions about any of this. I'd be happy to answer them.

This line is not correct - you should not be calling -measure in -layoutSpecThatFits:



If you ever did need to manually call measure, it might be from within the -layout method.  But you don't normally need any implementation of the -layout method.  For ASCellNodes, the -measure pass will be triggered automatically for you.  If you would like to see how it is triggered, set a breakpoint in -layoutSpecThatFits:, as that is called as part of the measurement pass.

A brief history. I did not have flickering in my view controller prior to supporting orientation. As my main view controller needs to stay in portrait, my image viewer did not. For this situation you're bound to a full screen presentation style instead of UIModalPresentationCurrentContext.

I know that @nguyenhuy / @levi and others are extremely interested in the possibility of enabling a per-item alignment in stacks as well (which in one of the orientations would translate to a per-item vertical alignment).  So my main question is how, if at all, we should integrate this with that.

Could you share a couple examples of the use cases you have found for this?  I'll note that it seems to me like this option will only take effect if the user sets the frame of the text node to be larger than it calculates for itself during the measurement pass.  This is something that should be avoided whenever convenient, because more memory is consumed by the blank areas in the larger backing store (and also, more blending / texture upload cost for the GPU).  Still, I think it is a worthwhile flexibility to have in the framework.
",appleguy,nivanchikov

It seems like I can't think of more than one example you already mentioned - when node bounds are larger than its content.

924,2015-12-09 02:06:47,"@aaronschubert0 super awesome, thank you!  I was just thinking about this earlier in the morning.

It would indeed be ideal to proved a property for region, and allow it to be set.  More likely than anything else it may be used to read the value before the node is loaded, but it seems useful to be able to set it too.

I might even suggest that we kill initWithRegion entirely (I know, I know ... I had suggested it), and just rely on the property.  This way if a user's app doesn't know the region at init time (seems plausible), they could set it in -fetchData or wherever else is appropriate.
",appleguy,aaronschubert0
924,2015-12-11 15:21:30,"@appleguy Hmm this is a tricky one. I've been thinking about this for a few days now. I'm not sure how comfortable I would be in having no custom init method that clearly specifies an action. If we did get rid of initWithRegion then we would have to provide a suitable default so that ASMapNode works out of the box. Although [[ASMapNode alloc] init] doesn't produce anything great either at the moment. I'm still 50/50. The layout spec (as well as ASImage/Text/ControlNode etc) conforms to a standard -init and then setting properties so maybe we should actually go this way to keep in line with the framework. Should we provide a default in this case?
",aaronschubert0,appleguy
924,2015-12-11 19:58:52,"@aaronschubert0 I think it's similar to UIView initWithFrame:, which actually is a bad practice / pattern to use, and so that's why ASDisplayNode does not have initWithFrame: even though it is basically a superset of the UIView API.

Let's go ahead and make it a plain -init with the region property.  Defaulting the region to ""whole world"" would make sense (not US, please!) - simply so that people creating a map node for the first time can see something show up if they don't have a region to set yet.
",appleguy,aaronschubert0
924,2015-12-16 10:41:50,"@appleguy I've made the specified changes. The major breaking change is getting rid of the custom init method in favour of altering the region property. Internally, I got rid of _mapNode to work directly with the MKMapView, change isLiveMap to be a 'computed' property and generally improved the code quality. The only snag left is the possibility of a retain cycle in the -addLiveMap method, I've commented on a previous comment asking how this may be solved, happy to change anything regarding this in a follow up diff.
",aaronschubert0,appleguy
924,2015-12-18 03:34:45,"@aaronschubert0 this is really getting there!  Did we add a test case for this, at least an example app?  I wonder if we could add some unit tests to make sure coverage stays high and we don't break it?

I'm going to land this one because it looks like a definitive improvement / step forward.  I do think we should bring back the BOOL and look for any other ways to make sure the internal logic / state is consistently handled for all the possible ordering of calls and use cases that nodes can go through.  One followup there is correct handling of layerBacked mode — at a minimum we'd need to add the mapView's sublayer as a sublayer of the node's layer when the node is layerBacked, but it's very possible that won't work correctly.  Yet we should support layerBacking for the default snapshotter mode.  So I'd suggest overriding setLayerBacked: and setLiveMap: for each to check for the other property being set and throw an assertion if at any point they are both enabled.
",appleguy,aaronschubert0
924,2015-12-21 10:38:58,"@appleguy Yeah!! So much better than when we started. Thanks for all the amazing feedback! I haven't added test cases yet but will add those along with an example app soon. Good point on the layer backing, can't forget about that! I'll add this in a future diff as well.

In terms of the BOOL, yeah I agree, it's tricky trying to minimise the internal state but will keep working on that and bringing back the BOOL does make it clearer.

For example, if you're not allowing enough width for the ""8test test ..."" line, then it having an ellipse at the end is expected.

922,2015-12-09 16:39:54,"@tomizimobile Thanks for another awesomely-thorough report!

On animations: I believe the reason `setAnimationsEnabled` isn't working in this case is, ASTableView enqueues those animations asynchronously after returning from `endUpdates`. In your test project, calling `tableView.endUpdatesAnimated(false, completion: nil)` does the trick for me. It's not API-compatible with UIKit, but is that OK?

On crashing when reloading data: This is indeed a bug in the framework! Diving in, I've found that during the `[super reloadData]`, `ASTableView` is returning 12 sections (the pre-filter value) when your table view data source is only returning 6 – the data controller must requery the underlying data source immediately, or else this `titleForHeader:` crash is inevitable. I tried shuffling around the implementation of `ASTableView.reloadData` but no luck.

The fact that `titleForHeader:` is a delegate method, not a data-source method, is kind of screwing with the data architecture of ASTableView, because it allows the client to talk directly to UITableView about its data, which isn't what's up. @nguyenhuy can you think of an approach that wouldn't tear ASTableView apart?
",Adlai-Holler,tomizimobile
922,2015-12-09 16:54:08,"@Adlai-Holler Hah, somehow I totally missed that `endUpdatesAnimated` even existed... it's perfect. That solves my animation issue, and the way I was doing it previously clearly can't realistically be supported. But if nothing else, it helped me root out a crash. 

Since I don't really have a need to `reloadData` anymore (nor did I really want to, given the performance hit), the crash isn't something I'm immediately worried about, but if anyone puts a fix in place and needs help testing it out, I'll be glad to help.

922,2015-12-09 18:01:03,"@tomizimobile `endUpdatesAnimated` is indeed the way to go in this case. Thanks for the helpful test repo. I can reproduce the crash with `reloadData` and agree with @Adlai-Holler that it is a framework bug. I also agree that clients shouldn't be allowed to talk directly to UITableView and return header titles. Instead, ASTableView should intercept `titleForHeader` calls and do something clever. I'm thinking about making ASTableView to cache all old titles, and then return them while its super (i.e, UITableView) is reloading ([here](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/AsyncDisplayKit/ASTableView.mm#L330)). The cache will be cleared later on, either right after the UITableView's reload or after the underlying data controller finished. 

Another approach is to ban `titleForHeader` completely and encourage those who need to show header titles to switch to ASCollectionView instead. There is a stable implementation of supplementary views support in ASCollectionView. And it will be an easy switch because all the nodes are already of type ASCellNode.

I've been head-desk-banging a bit because the tests are still not passing.  In fact the output of the snapshot tests is blank for many ASLayoutSpec tests, even though ASLayoutSpec-based apps are running fine.  I haven't found an example app with a visible bug yet, which is strange, so I'm suspecting something about the highly artificial force-display mechanisms used by the test harnesses.  Still I don't want to make a change that breaks those, at least until they're working again (at which point I'd like to replace the hackily... method signature with the properly-supported -recursivelyEnsureDisplay or similar).

I want to make sure that my currently planned fix approach, which is aimed at another scenario reported in a different issue, will also fix this - but the backtraces are the most essential information for this.

Thanks so much for reporting this quickly — it's great for me to know this as I start resolving the underlying issue!

912,2015-12-06 01:47:39,"@appleguy The previously attached `freeze.txt` includes a backtrace for the main thread which seems to be the most relevant one, but here's another full backtrace that's also frozen at a different function - let me know if you'd like more.

912,2015-12-07 03:56:01,"@tomizimobile thanks for the additional log!  I just analyzed them in detail and audited every usage of _editingTransactionQueue.  The problem is I can't find anything executed on the queue that synchronously depends on the main thread, which seems logically necessary to cause a deadlock.  I could be missing something, no doubt...but the issue is that the log has no relevant detail in the background thread backtrace.

If you aren't able to provide the code that is triggering this issue and can't adapt / rewrite an existing example project to make it occur, can you take a closer look at what is happening on this thread?

You may be able to print out the NSOperation pointer and possibly get some information about where it originates.  Maybe add a name to the operation.

I would like to fix this ASAP, although unless we can get some more information on this issue in the next few hours, it looks like it will have to miss 1.9.3.  However we should be able to fix in the next few days, with your help on the debugging / inspection side (I can do the actual fix as well as testing, though confirmation that it resolves your deadlock would also really benefit from you giving it a test-run).  With this route, you can point your project to master until the next release goes out...currently don't have a 1.9.4 planned, but it will probably end up happening before the full 2.0.

912,2015-12-07 04:06:15,"@tomizimobile FWIW - it would be darn near invaluable to have a unit / integration test that can reproduce the deadlock even occasionally.  I bet if the text entry was programmatically triggered, it would occur much more frequently / consistently.  Then we could put it in the test target that is run by the build server, and/or integrate it in ASTableViewStressTest.

The reason is simple - we do already have a variety of tests for these components, but even the ""stress test"" passes.  It's a clear indication that we need a more stressful test :).  Being able to catch this one with the test and then fix it would be a huge contribution to our ability to confidently refactor and optimize the implementation.  I have a lot of ideas about such optimizations, but often put them off because of some fear of causing issues :-P.

",tomizimobile,appleguy
912,2015-12-07 16:27:45,"@appleguy Alright, so after trying to get to the minimal code that produces the problem coming from my current project, I realized the issue was something to do with my data source locking. As it turns out, you shouldn't pass a String to `objc_sync_enter()`/`objc_sync_exit()`. I had been going off some code I found that mimics `@synchronized` from Obj-C, which accepts `AnyObject` into a function like so: 



Once I replaced my string constant with an `NSLock`, things are working as expected. 

Sorry for causing all that extra work for you when it turned out to be an issue on my end. With that said, I still have the previously mentioned issue with the app crashing when trying to use `reloadData()` instead of `beginUpdates()`/`endUpdates()`. This is sufficient for now, but the advantage to using `reloadData()` is it gets rid of any animation - even though i've set all my delete/insert animation options to `.None`, and even after wrapping my `beginUpdates()`/`endUpdates()` in `UIView.setAnimationsEnabled(false)`/`UIView.setAnimationsEnabled(true)` or `UIView.performWithoutAnimation`, animations still occur. This is still the case in the current master (f5d06c5989da0f5e34c1d9b330f5ae71aa3a1fcb).

912,2015-12-07 16:55:14,"Thanks for the details!  I actually prefer this result, rather than you having never reported it and being puzzled for a long time about the issue without having some external investigation help!

I would like to resolve the reloadData issue, including the ability to prevent animations with updates.  Can you link me to or file an issue for that?

I am very interested in the languages of the world, and it was actually a top consideration of mine in developing AsyncDisplayKit...because more complex scripts like the CJK languages, Thai, Hebrew, Mongolian, Arabic, etc often take 10 times the CPU power to size or render!

Did you have any other questions for us at the moment?  Please file another task any time.

909,2015-12-03 21:16:43,"@Eke setting `placeholderFadeDuration` to 60 will make the animation fade over 60 seconds. I would recommend setting it to 0.4 or 0.2. Moreover, the `placeholderInsets` is the issue you're facing. Simply leave it at the default value of `UIEdgeInsetsZero`.

909,2015-12-03 21:18:16,"@Eke hmm, very interesting!  The behavior looks correct EXCEPT of course the fact that it is not removing the placeholder upon the completion of the text rendering.

[edit] - ha @levi is certainly right.  Start by disabling the fade entirely.  That feature is not perfectly reliable and is a bit expensive from a performance perspective because it performs the fades even for things that are offscreen a bit.  It will actually be very simple to improve it using the new ASInterfaceState parameter (we can simply check if the interfaceState is Visible before initiating the fade), but it doesn't work that way today.  I am sure you'd be able to make that change if you are interested in keeping the fade.

If the app is deadlocked, when iOS will kill it once it doesn't respond to the shutdown callbacks for ~10 seconds.  It will then generate a crash log with full backtrace of every thread, which should show us any threads that are deadlocked.

I'm going to read your code in more detail shortly; thank you for posting it to help us investigate!!  I haven't heard of a deadlock reported in ASDK from a user of the stable branch in a long time...in fact, I can't /ever/ recall one report of this type of issue...so I am very eager to figure it out.  Despite being very tough to catch in the act, it is likely an easy fix / diagnosis once we have that crash log pulled from the device.

Now the fun part — when I was typing this, I tried to open the app, left it where it was and then the screen went out. After I picked it again to unlock it, I can see lockscreen with animated unlock prompt and everything, but it doesnt respond to any of my taps and swipes, AT ALL. So I've killed the app using Xcode and now I had a black screen. To fix this I had to longpress power button to invoke shutdown prompt and dismissed it, then I was back on home screen.

No I don't use jailbreak :))) So..what the what??

900,2015-12-04 06:05:02,"@Adlai-Holler what a nasty bug.  I completely agree regarding the property system.  It is the largest essential refactor I see in the project right now.

Another underlying factor is the extremely coarse granularity of _propertyLock; it is used for essentially everything.  I think it may be possible to break this cycle by splitting out a _loadLock or similar.

If closer analysis reveals the lock split will not quite avoid a different point of dependency occurring, I believe we can break the chain at the __rasterizedContainerNode level. Passing that state from above whenever a node enables or disables rasterization would also optimize certain calls in a way that could be net-beneficial for performance.

Is this the desired behavior? Right now my node hierarchy is simple but I wonder if it'll be expensive to use such animations in more complex nodes.
",doguhanokumus,appleguy
898,2015-12-01 12:39:41,"@Adlai-Holler Thanks for bringing this up! It's absolutely true that after a relayout that doesn't result in a size change, the container view (i.e table view or collection view) doesn't need to be bothered. The reason it is still notified was that I wanted to make use of built-in reload animations (fb18e76). But after we replaced reloads with empty transactions in 5701cbb, that reason is no longer valid! Unnecessary empty transactions are inefficient. Sorry for triggering them in the first place :)

897,2015-12-04 03:35:58,"@tettoffensive The best way to fix this right now is actually to call setInterfaceState: yourself on the node.  I have the property set to readonly, but that's simply because I wanted to provide better documentation for the appropriate use cases to do this before making the API that flexible.

Likewise, I apologize for this regression, and thank you for reporting it.  Though it immediately makes sense and the cause is well-understood, I did NOT realize this would affect current clients of the framework and would have proceeded differently with this change had I known that.

Could you share with me the details on why you are containing a node directly within a standard UIView?  There are a couple behaviors that don't work well with this; most notably, nothing will trigger rendering (or indeed even data fetching) before the view is added to the hierarchy, and that often doesn't happen until the element is visible onscreen.  So it basically deactivates all of the fancy preloading stuff that makes ASDK apps feel ""seamless"" in that content is usually there and rendered even with smooth scrolling.  You will, of course, still be getting big benefits from rendering staying off the main thread.

You might consider using ASViewController in your scenario.  Though it doesn't support interfaceState today, it will in an upcoming release this month.  It will not only automatically set interfaceState on the node tree that it hosts, but also allow the user to set custom interface states so you can trigger data loading or rendering before the VC is visible.

@Adlai-Holler — I think your suggested workaround is the best course of action until these other usages / flexibilities of interfaceState are built out.  Once those things are done, we might consider restricting use of nodes in arbitrary UIViews, perhaps by requiring a certain property be enabled that explains to engineers the implications / tradeoffs of doing this.  The other path is to consider this a valid use case for ASDK and retain first class support for it, with automatic interfaceState changes according to the limited information available from UIView / CALayer hierarchy change notifications.  My main hesitation with that is simple: I'm not that sure what use cases that would help support, since it seems to me like a pretty bad issue for asynchronous rendering to never be triggered until something is visible.

897,2015-12-04 16:15:32,"@appleguy while most of the time my use of ASDK is for complex hierarchies
of views involving table and collection views and custom nodes, I got used
to using ASNetworkImageNode (along with caching via SDWebImage). It is
extremely convenient for things like user profile photos. And I often just
need that on a UIView like the toolbar or profile view. Since UIView has
addSubnode and there has to be some entry point into AS mode hierarchy, I
figured this was supported.
I like the flexibility of being able to mix like this without needing more
complexity.

I am now planning a 1.9.3 to launch by the end of this weekend to resolve two recently discovered issues.  I will make this the third, and expect to have a solution for you in the next couple days.  Let me know if you discover any additional issues, or a fix / workaround for this one.

I also verified memory behavior — using Leaks / Allocations tool, ensured all of the ASDK-associated objects that are created by the button press are torn down. It seems stable over multiple launches of the modal view.

I was studying the code for this and realized the most likely cause is a ""performOnMain"" call that happens just before deallocation.  Then the main call occurs with something like reloadData, in the next runloop, and triggers the layout assertion.

Then I realized that a diff I had open to review would almost certainly address this condition.  Turns out it did, which is an awesome coincidence (and shows how a layout change triggered by tear-down could even cause asynchronous data reloading -- no good!).  https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/898  Thank you @Adlai-Holler !

894,2015-11-30 04:25:06,"@Adlai-Holler woah, super fast - thanks!

BTW I now have a plan to quite robustly fix ASRangeController with relatively little work, reaching a stable state from which we can survey any longer term directions.  There are two key steps:
1. Finish the elimination of the workingWindow.  This patch already functions, but it needs testing and especially validation of display cancellation / multiple display calls before the previous display has completed.  This will make sure the ranges don't rely on external state that isn't controlled in the setInterfaceState: codepath.
2. Replace the -update method in ASRangeController to simply request the full set of index paths within each range, on every update.  Create a 4th set by taking the union of the 3 range sets (or N), and iterate over each indexPath.  For each, test if it exists in each of the individual ranges, and set the corresponding ASInterfaceState bitfield accordingly.  Finally, obtain the ASCellNode - and crucially - first check if cell.interfaceState != interfaceState.  Only if the root / cell itself doesn't match, then proceed to make a recursive call to setInterfaceState: on all children, each of which will take action only on the elements of the state which have changed.

This will resolve a great deal of issues, including the one you discovered related to existing indexPaths changing to different cells, because it will be up to the cells to understand / ""remember"" what states they have transitioned through and identify which states are changes or no-ops.

We will need one new method to go alongside enterInterfaceState: and exitInterfaceState: -- in fact, we should consider eliminating / making private those two methods.  The new one is basically just recursivelySetInterfaceState:, since with this model the controller won't actually know which states are being entered vs exited (but the node will).

The last detail here I haven't thought through is how to exit cells from /all/ ranges.  I think this could be pretty straightforward, although an efficient solution that doesn't require visiting / checking the interfaceState of every completedNode may be nontrivial.  I'd be supportive of an ""inefficient"" but highly robust solution as our next step, especially because even the inefficient solution is likely efficient enough since we're talking about a large number of individual property accesses with a single integer comparison.

If master is good enough for 1.9.2, then I would land the CK text engine after branching, and start to make risky changes to the workingWindow / ASRangeController.

@levi in any case, we should ensure that it is very difficult to cause a crash even if LayoutInspecting or something else is not implemented correctly.

893,2015-11-30 01:17:14,"@stowy awesome, thanks for the details.  What commit hash is the HEAD of your version of ASDK?  Can you re-link your project against the latest master version and let me know if the crash either goes away or changes?

I notice in the stack some stuff about GPRaptorEngine, and then a trampoline call.  Are you absolutely certain that the asyncDataSource and asyncDelegate are in a consistent state?  Remember, ASCollectionView has special behavior that creates a separation between the UIKit layer and the ASDK layer to facilitate asynchronous computation, so if your subclass of ASCollectionView is doing fancy stuff at the UIKit layer (such as calling UICollectionView methods that aren't bridged / implemented by ASCollectionView), it could cause a variety of issues like this.

It may well be that the bug is in ASDK, but it would be important to know if the reason is that ASDK is missing an override for some UICollectionView method that we didn't think of which your class may be using.  cc @levi

I may be able to fully understand when I can look into the code alongside reading your description, but since I'm on a plane that is about to push back from the gate, I'll start with a question for you!

Question: are you saying that in this situation, the display is cancelled /but no replacement display is scheduled, and it should be scheduled/?

Do you believe that it should be cancelled and then re-displayed, or do you believe that it is always safe to avoid cancelling in this situation entirely and no re-display is needed?

I'm really glad you dug into the implementation here, as these days I am one of the only folks looking at this particular code path :).

Question 1:
Yes. if it's layer.content is nil, it would be re-display. But sometimes it's layer.content is stale not nil.
a stale layer.content must follows scheduled display.

Question 2:
I believe that (avoid cancelling when node `__exitHierarchy`) is good choice.
layer.content should be always fresh or nil when no scheduled display.

I'm glad to learn so much from the library. :)

- What version of AsyncDisplayKit are you using?  Do you have the Git commit #?  There are a few crashes that are vaguely similar to this that have been addressed in master - even the latest stable release, 1.9.1, doesn't include all of them.  If you are doing an update of your app soon, I suggest shipping with Cocoapods / Carthage pointing at the latest master commit for now (several other active clients are doing this at the moment).
- Are you using the ""automaticallyAdjustsContentOffset"" property?
- Are you using ASTableView, or ASCollectionView?  Why is your method named -reloadTableOrCollection - presumably it can only be one or the other?
- What is the log / string provided by the NSException?  Exceptions always have an additional string that describes what happened - for example, one possibility with this stack is that NaN was provided to the scrolling method.  Although we have seen and fixed a crash related to -reloadData, it did not involve scrolling to a different contentOffset...and indeed, I have never (so far) seen a crash in this method.  There is certainly a possibility that the bug is in the framework, but you should also scrutinize the values you are providing.

- No -layout / -calculateSizeThatFits: implementation in the class that creates and adds the subnode.  Alternatively, instead of implementing both of those methods, you may choose to implement ONLY the -layoutSpecThatFits: method.  See my NSSpain talk for more details.

886,2015-11-29 00:09:36,"@bimawa Cool diagram, thanks!  You are one of the only people I know who has attempted to use ReactiveCocoa with ASDK - the only other one I currently know of is @RuiAAPeres.

I think this is very likely to be perilous.  RAC is an amazing, very interesting framework — but these two are not known to be compatible, and from everything I know about RAC, they are pretty fundamentally difficult to integrate.

isFinalLayoutable is not to be used in the way that you're using it.  So be aware that it may seriously break other functionality.  This affects the internals of the layout system in ways that you are not intending, so it isn't a stable solution for what you'd like to do.  I'm not sure how RAC observation works, but if it is at all related to KVO, note that the ASDK properties (intentionally) are not KVO / KVC-compliant.

That said, from the diagram above, a few comments:
- ASLayoutSpec is not mutable after you have returned it from -layoutSpecThatFits:.  So, after the new data arrives, you must not modify any existing layout.  I in fact don't see a need for you to check if the current layout is done.
- Instead, I would expect you need to call something like -invalidateLayout and -setNeedsLayout, possibly -layoutIfNeeded if you want it to occur immediately (although the latter method must be called on the main thread, I'm pretty sure the others are thread safe - look at the implementation to confirm, as it is uncommon to use them off the main thread, but apparently with RAC this may be a useful property).
- It may be better to use a technique such as allocating a new node hierarchy once the new data has returned, and once it has finished layout (you can call -measureWithSizeRange: on any background thread yourself - and it will execute in-line, so you will no when it is done), you can ""wholesale replace"" the entire previous node hierarchy. This would make it so that it doesn't matter if the previous node hierarchy is finished or completed with layout.  You could use something like reloadRow/ItemAtIndexPath: and return the new ASCellNode, or manually replace a subnode of an existing ASCellNode.

I'm sure there are techniques that can be used to make this work, and I am open to changes to ASDK that will improve the compatibility with RAC if they are proposed by the community and don't negatively affect the complexity or behavior of ASDK apps that do not use RAC.  I'll rename this task for further discussion about RAC.

883,2015-11-24 05:48:27,"@KieranLafferty Hey there - thanks for posting, would love to help!

In general, simply wrapping a UIView doesn't mean the node needs to be created or sized off the main thread, as the UIView itself isn't created until the view property is accessed (which must always be on the main thread).

The issue you're describing could happen if you are saving your ASCellNode and reusing it on multiple calls of nodeForRow/ItemAtIndexPath: (at the higher level - the thing containing the cell which contains the collection node).

Could you share the full backtrace, as well as more details about your use case?  Is the ASCollectionNode a fixed height element that scrolls horizontally, or is it intended to lay out items vertically but not scroll at all because it is inside of another cell?  Or is the cell inside a horizontal collection and you want the collection node to scroll vertically?

All this said, you have discovered a true limitation / rough edge of ASDK in master that I am working to fix up in the next ~3-4 weeks before the full 2.0 release (the first stable release of the ASLayoutSpec stuff).  The very best way to handle layouts containing ASCollectionNodes or ASTableNodes is to use either an ASStaticLayoutSpec, or what often ends up being easier is to implement a very simple -layout method.

As long as your -layout method calls [super layout], you can still use ASLayoutSpecs / -layoutSpecThatFits: to size and position everything else.  Then after calling super, simply set the frame of the _collectionNode to whatever it should be.  You can even rely on reading the value of _itemView.frame or do a convertRect at this stage if necessary.

Thanks for sending on some screenshots / backtrace details / description of your use case, or perhaps modifying a sample project to drop in the relevant sections of your code, if this description doesn't immediately solve your issue!

880,2015-11-24 06:07:27,"@robmontesinos Hey, thanks for bringing this up.  Could you share a bit more information about the condition you're aiming to detect?  Does the server give an HTTP 404 or some other error when you access the other URL?

In general, it would be best for the app to be able to detect and adjust to this condition without relying simply on the URL request.  There are many reasons a URL request can fail, and of course it takes a full round trip time to figure out what has happened.

I'd suggest, for example, if the user changes their profile picture then immediately trigger a query of the server for any ""current user"" objects or other loaded data to get updated URLs - before the URLs are actually needed to be displayed.  A key reason for this is that the code which knows how to find the right URL, if the current one fails, is at a higher level in the architecture of the app than just the lowly image node.  The image node should not understand the true ""source"" of the image or how it would go about requesting an updated data model directly from the server.

All that said, yes it is probably fairly straightforward to add a callback to an image node delegate (I think Multiplex already has a  delegate or datasource API; Network might also) which reports any loading errors to the owner of the node.  This I think would be a reasonable step even if you don't use it for the purpose described, which I'd recommend avoiding.  The main consideration is whether the ASImageDownloader protocol is actually the best place to support this kind of thing.  For example, ASBasicImageDownloader could provide the error callback directly.  If it were added to the protocol itself, then it would require all downloaders to support passing the errors to the node just so the node could pass them to an /optional/ delegate method...and we don't want that.

You may want to use this AsyncDisplayKit-integrated version of SDWebImage: https://github.com/ide/WebASDKImageManager

Pinterest is also currently working on some special custom integrations between PINRemoteImage and AsyncDisplayKit, but this won't be available for a few months and we haven't thought about an error API outside the framework.

880,2015-11-24 07:47:38,"Thanks for getting back to me @appleguy. I have a list of twitter users where I persist their image URL's in Core Data. If the user changes an image, Twitter gives back a bad url message and the place holder image remains. The reason I use Core Data is to limit the API calls since Twitter counts them (I think it's 180 per hour) so I update twitter user particulars (followers and images, etc.) lazily as needed.

I wound up solving this by using NSURLConnection and a mutable request (asynchronous) for HEAD which returns status 200 -> do nothing else fetch new URL's from Twitter and reload the ASNetworkImageNode. I used kind of a hack and wait 2 seconds to check URL and I also use a flag to ignore this step if the image downloaded successfully. It was also easier to have the node check itself and add the Twitter request as an operation to the main operation queue. It's not elegant but it works fine. 

I didn't think it would be a big deal to implement completion and failure blocks similar to AFNetworking. I'll take a look at WebASDKImageManager - I used it elsewhere for image caching but I didn't look at it closely for completion blocks. Thanks for the heads up!!

One reason it is not an obvious fit is that ASDK currently supports standard UICollectionViewLayouts, without any modification for ASDK (there is no special AS-subclass).  This means that a variety of Cocoapods can be directly imported, and even without modification, they can be kept up to date by following the version changes of the cocoa pod.  That's a compelling advantage.

@levi is also absolutely right that efficiently doing this layout is more work than we have here, and there are libraries to do it.

Perhaps most importantly, I think only about 10% or even less of ASDK apps would use this particular layout.  Though a small impact, the compiled size of a complex, efficient layout may be several dozen KB and would increase the build time of the framework for everyone, so it's something to think about.

All that said...I am thinking we will create a custom AS-based layout class soon, because it will provide important efficiency advantages over UICollectionViewLayout.  In that world, it becomes more interesting to include a library of built-in layouts.  I appreciate very much having your vote on this as it really does influence what we decide to do here.

Note that aside from cocoapods you can search for, this PR was put up a while back that has some pretty hardcore code to do this, and looks like it might be very efficient.

877,2015-11-22 21:38:20,"@soniccat thanks for investigating this, and especially for providing a test project.

AsyncDisplayKit is not considered compatible with Interface Builder.  If this fix is carefully tested to be safe for all use cases that don't rely on Interface Builder, and also doesn't have any negative impact on performance, I'm happy to take it even if it only benefits IB.  However, the text code paths are tremendously critical to the framework so we need to move very carefully here.

If you could tweak the brace style to match the nearby methods and remove the Podfile.lock method, we'll be closer to landing.

@levi or @rcancro if you happen to have time to look into the test project to understand the issue and the fix, that would be great.  It will take me at least a week to get back to this because of some key deliverables before Thanksgiving, and then visiting family for the rest of the week, but we will keep this PR open until a decision is made.

",soniccat,appleguy
877,2015-11-30 20:15:07,"@soniccat I'm still looking at this one actively - thanks for your patience, and providing detailed information.  Is it correct to understand this diff as automatically re-measuring the text /synchronously on the drawing thread/ in the event there is a size mismatch?

@ocrickard, @levi I would be interested in your thoughts on this behavior.  I really don't think this is necessarily the right behavior to fix the XIB case, but it may be a better behavior for the framework overall.  In the XIB case, we might as well skip the first measurement entirely if the text node's size is not essential to calculating the layout (e.g., if the layout defines the text node's constrained size, but the calculated size is not actually needed).

@nguyenhuy, @soniccat my concern with this is that the overall layout may be incorrect in this scenario, and this behavior could potentially hide the incorrectness in some cases (e.g. making it behave correctly when the actual inputs / code flows are not normal, such as requiring double-sizing of text).

The alternative might be to rely on -invalidateLayout or some other call, and ensure that if the display pass detects there is a mismatch, it triggers as complete of a layout pass is necessary to guarantee that any components that are affected by the newly calculated size of the text have a chance to be adjusted.  This could even mean abandoning the current display pass with an early return and calling -setNeedsDisplay, awaiting a new display call after the relayout is complete?

874,2015-11-21 02:27:42,"@smyrgl Thanks for the report.  This is a known issue, I believe you simply need to set .flexShrink = YES on the Inset spec.  I agree this is NOT intuitive, although note that it is the same behavior as ComponentKit.

@rcancro and @nguyenhuy have discussed this with me and we are trying to figure out the right behavior.  Because the layout system is so configurable, there are pitfalls to most changes; for example I have a PR up to set flexShrink on by default for ASTextNode, because it seems more intuitive, but I haven't landed it yet as it does have a couple tradeoffs.

This isolated case may be easier to fix if we decide that the Inset should inherit flexGrow or flexShrink from its child.  However, another case we've considered is when you have a vertical stack and every item (say they are ASTextNodes) has flexShrink set.  If we did this for Inset and not for Stack, it could be confusing; but if we did it for both, there are other tradeoffs and it still wouldn't apply to custom specs.

Anyway, we'd be thrilled if you have any thoughts (read: value judgements - what seems like the ""right"" behavior for these subjective decisions?) to share with us.  In fact, this specific issue and a small handful of related ones are the primary reason that we are at 1.9.x and not 2.0 yet.  Let's make this the most intuitive implementation of Box Model around and get it shipped!

This was the only thing standing in my way of converting my whole project to the new layout system and now that this is done I've only got about 20% of my nodes left that need conversion.
",smyrgl,appleguy
874,2015-11-23 20:40:28,"While I believe that the documentation must better communicate that stack-related properties (flexShrink, flexGrow, flexBasis, etc) are only considered when set to _immediate_ children of stack specs, I think the copying behaviour might be good idea and make the layout system more robust. But I agree with @appleguy that it would be confusing if we implemented flexShrink inheritance for some specs (say, inset and ratio specs) and not others. We need to consider the tradeoffs carefully. 

I'm also thinking that maybe all layoutable objects should have flexShrink enabled by default. It actually is consistent with the Flexbox spec and might even improve the experience of new users. But it will be a big breaking change :(
",nguyenhuy,appleguy
873,2015-11-22 21:44:19,"@nguyenhuy I think we should prevent the stack direction from being changed.  Because a layout spec locks down as immutable after it is returned anyway, there is no valid use case for changing the stack direction.

This would be a bit unusual, but let's keep the direction property as writable, but add comments that it can only be set once — and throw an assertion if it is changed after it has already been set.

Implementing justifySelf would be a huge development, as it would allow us to extend this valuable pattern to each item.  I think that would be a ""holy grail"" of layout in ASDK, to be honest :).  We should do more research on whether a) CSS / Flexbox support this, b) React or CK have evaluated supporting this (or do now?), and c) make a final decision on whether we'll aim to do this.  If it looks like it will be too complicated to do, that decision itself is useful as we should look at better documenting alignSelf.

873,2015-11-23 18:56:47,"@appleguy I agree that we should keep the direction property as writable.

Regarding justifySelf:
- I think CK doesn't supported it as of now, though I'm not sure if CK has evaluated supporting. Not sure about React either. 
- justifySelf is defined in CSS Box spec but not in Flexbox spec. This is probably the reason:

864,2015-11-19 21:05:29,"@molon Good question, I will give you a more comprehensive answer as soon as I have time (it may be this weekend).

Some options include disabling displaysAsynchronously on any of the nodes that do rendering (you can enable / disable this at will - but it is not recursive, has to be on each node) - or you can call -recursivelyEnsureDisplay.

Depending on the situation you may be able to use neverShowPlaceholders on ASViewController or ASCellNode, too.

Thanks so much for including a test project!  That is tremendously helpful and also considerate of you to provide to the community to make it easier for us to help out.  I will do my best to get you a solution by the end of the weekend, although with some Thanksgiving travel involved, worst case it might take into next week.

If you need a solution right away, I recommend the displaysAsynchronously = NO route (even if you have to set that upon creating the nodes rather than changing it dynamically).  Even with this setting, you will still get the benefit of concurrent calculation of layout in the background, and it will be easy for us to re-enable asynchronous display with a more targeted fix later.
",appleguy,molon
864,2015-11-20 03:40:32,"@appleguy Thanks so much for your answer. I'm very sorry for your travel. :)

With the answer, I have checked the source with `recursivelyEnsureDisplay` , it just call `[subnode.layer displayIfNeed]`. But in my issue , the reason is no `[subnode.layer setNeedsDisplay]` be called.

I have update my test project to describe better with the issue, and my current solution in `TimelinePopoverNode.m`->



Because I'm not familiar with ASDK much.
So I want to know whether the solution I gave in floor 1(add `[_layer setNeedDisplay]` in `__setSafeFrame`) will take some adverse effects.
",molon,appleguy
863,2015-11-19 21:11:53,"Yes, this is essentially expected - the alternative is to do the UITableView behavior where, during the processing related to the reload, the user is blocked from any interaction with the app.  If this is what you desire, then reloadDataImmediately is what you need :).

If you don't want the placeholder states to be shown, you'll also need to enable .neverShowPlaceholders on ASCellNode.  This is a very cool option that still allows concurrent background rendering - it just has the main thread wait if any of those elements are onscreen.  As opposed to UIKit which is single threaded and blocks main, this is a big optimization as it does use all cores and reduces the amount of time main is blocked.

More importantly, avoiding -reloadData altogether is the best option.  Using the editing commands of insert, delete, reload, move, etc are the best option if you can manage it.

861,2015-11-30 01:11:54,"@Adlai-Holler solid debugging here — a very clear explanation of the problem.  I think this is strong support for the impression that ASRangeController needs its first big refactor, as today its core logic is from the same era as the original ASDataController (!!!).

@1nput0utput could you share any details on the issue you encountered?  Was your case specific to reloadData (and thus fixed by the patch linked above), or is the editing scenario described later the one you are seeing?

As per usual with these issues, not having a test case is one inhibition to fixing with confidence.  I'm actively mucking about in ASRangeController (and @levi too, who did a sweeping cleanup of naming and organization of the file in prep for deeper changes).  But with the weekend dwindling, I may not be able to fix this in time for 1.9.2...

The PR I just landed, with ASInterfaceState, holds the potential to help us fix this.  It makes nodes tolerant to ""sloppy"" behavior of a class like ASRangeController, in that if the class were too chatty and told it to enter or exit a state multiple times, it would short-circuit and not actually cause errant calls to fetchData / clearContents / etc (this was not the case before the patch).  So if we found the right point at which to do a reconciliation (setting the intended state on all the nodes involved), it could actually be pretty efficient.

The ideal refactor for ASRangeController will be to eliminate ASRangeHandler entirely, and call setInterfaceState only once per node on a given pass.  This would particularly optimize the case being described here where new / replacement nodes may need to have multiple elements of the state set (such as visible, display, fetchData).

858,2015-11-18 16:06:02,"@smiLLe: IIRC, CK*LayoutComponents are subclasses of CKComponent and basically have everything CKComponent has, including a backing view. 

In ASDK, both ASLayoutSpec and ASDisplayNode conform to ASLayoutable protocol. But unlike an ASDisplayNode, an ASLayoutSpec doesn't have any backing store (view/layer) and many other properties. It just purely provides some layout properties (that ASLayoutable requires) and an algorithm for laying out its ASLayoutable children. In fact, it only exists during a layout pass and is thrown away right after an ASLayout object is calculated.

You got the ""Stretch"" thing right after me :) Thanks for answering questions lately and welcome to the community.

I will start with code inspection, but if you are able to provide a sample project, it would surely be valuable — at the least, it would help confirm any fix that we come up with.
",appleguy,smyrgl
854,2015-11-19 21:29:34,"Yeah, I think the error is fairly obvious looking at the code.  That much is great news... haha.

@smyrgl what is your expected behavior in this case?  Do you want the call to block on the creation and layout of the nodes that will be visible, even though that is happening asynchronously and there aren't in fact /any/ nodes visible in this state?

As a workaround (not a fix / ability to close this task), you can the batch update calls (or call reload) using the version that includes a completionBlock.  Alternatively you can use reloadDataImmediately.  Both should ensure that at least the visible nodes are created and added by the time you call this method.
",appleguy,smyrgl
854,2015-11-20 09:10:07,"@appleguy Actually what I'm doing here is during scroll I'm triggering animated images to start animating but only after they are actually visible.  This is the sort of task that `visibleCells` would normally be useful for (which I assume is what this is trying to duplicate) so actually if the nodes aren't ready yet I would simply expect them not to return as they are not ""visible"" yet. :)

Your suggestion for a workaround is unnecessary since a better option would be to just override the node functions  `displayWillStart`, `displayDidFinish` to start it and `didExitHierarchy` to stop it as they will give me more relevant callbacks.  The reason I went after visibleNodes is simply because I want to get only the nodes in the visible view during scroll and in UIKit visibleCells is the best way to do that.

854,2015-11-20 09:17:33,"Oh sorry @appleguy here's the relevant code...I don't think you'll need much more than this but let me know if you need more context.


",smyrgl,appleguy
854,2015-12-04 04:10:58,"@smyrgl thanks for sharing the code!  Definitely helps me understand what you're aiming to do.  Note that if there is any ""loading"" state in your app (e.g. if you were to only want the animation to occur if an image weren't finished loading when it came onscreen, and thus animate in when it finishes loading), you might want to take a slightly different approach using some of the ASDK placeholder features.  Just let me know if you can't achieve the affect you're looking for with the below suggestion.

1.9.2 launched a few days ago and includes ASInterfaceState.  If you implement -setInterfaceState: in a subclass of ASDisplayNode, or if you have a hook where you can check (node.interfaceState & ASInterfaceStateVisible), you'll have a convenient way to do what you're looking for!  Right now, this works in any descendent of an ASCellNode, whether it's in a collection or a table.  You don't have to implement / check it on the cell itself; any part of the hierarchy will do, as long as it is in the hierarchy at the time that the interfaceState is set on the cell.

Make sure to call super if you override setInterfaceState:.  I will soon provide an API like interfaceStateDidChange:(ASInterfaceState)oldState - a bit cleaner than overriding the setter, but functionally equivalent.

Please let me know if you encounter any issues with this functionality!  In that case, file a new task as it would be related to ASInterfaceState rather than the original issue reported here.  If it works well for you, ping me in a comment here :).

I am going to leave this task open to be resolved in an upcoming release.  1.9.3 is an expedited release going out this Sunday night, so it may not make that, but I'm going to put it there for now just in case anyone in the community can take a look.

853,2015-11-19 21:21:51,"@molon great question!  You found the right approach; if you want to use ASLayoutSpec with a traditional UIView, wrapping it with an ASDisplayNode is the best option.

I don't see any bugs with the code you just provided, so unfortunately the issue is a bit mysterious to me.  A few questions:

1) Can you try out using master?  There is an issue that is now fixed in master which affected rare cases when inserting rows and then scrolling down, and could cause content to disappear.  I doubt this is your problem, just want to make sure.
2) Could you provide a screenshot of the first display when it's apparently working correctly, and then a screenshot of when you have scrolled back and the content is incorrect?
3) You are not using any special features such as .isLayerBacked or .shouldRasterizeDescendants, right?
4) Understanding that this is not a solution - but still an important question - what features does ASTextNode lack that lead you to require the third-party library?
5) Lastly, if you are able to provide a test project — for example, a diff that can be applied to an existing sample app such as Kittens or SocialAppLayout — that can implement something similar and reproduce the issue, that would surely be the fastest way for me to understand and solve the issue with you.

These elements work in a wide variety of situations without any known regressions, so I suspect there is something such as rasterization causing the issue here.

@smiLLe: Thanks for the heads-up and mentioning the CK issue. Changing flexGrow and flexShrink to integers and supporting proportionally shrinking/growing would be useful (but breaking) changes. It would be great if we have a separate issue for this matter. I think we should aim for v2.1?

851,2015-12-01 20:04:57,"@appleguy A flex-shrink integer specifies the shrink factor of a child, which determines how much it will shrink relative to all other shrinkable children. If all shrinkable children have the same flex-shrink value, negative free space will be evenly distributed among them. So for current users, `flexShrink = YES` essentially means `flexShrink = 1`, which is the default value. A flex-shrink of 0 means not-shrinkable (thus equals `flexShrink = NO`). Negative values are invalid, and so NSUInteger seems like the correct data type.

Original spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#flex-shrink-factor
Easier-to-understand explanation: https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-visual-guide-to-css3-flexbox-properties#flex-shrink

Similar behaviour for **flex-grow** integer.

If we decide to implement flex-shrink and flex-grow integers, most of the work will be about implementing proportionally shrinking and growing behaviours.

",appleguy,smiLLe
844,2015-11-14 01:41:26,"@Adlai-Holler I'm halfway glad you ran into this issue, because I am planning a fix for this very weekend.  This is a somewhat tough problem, but my plan is to ensure that each node has a query-able state that indicates its presence or absence from the Network range, Render range, and the brand new Visible range.  Later, I'm going to add an Allocation + Measurement range (long story on why they have to be the same range), but that's a far bigger change for a few reasons.

This is in part associated with my focus on eliminating the ""working window"".  Anyway, we'll probably need some new API like ""setNeedsDataFetch"", which if called when outside the network range, simply queues for the next time it's entered - or is handled immediately if inside the range currently.

Any other challenges you're running into?  The API design considerations around this are unfortunately maddening, and I have decided that in order to be able to make progress I'm first going to build some of this stuff as internal-only as it may evolve once other interdependent parts are fleshed out.  But anyway, it would be no problem at all for ASMultiplexImageNode to have framework-internal knowledge of this state and be able to automatically issue new fetches as appropriate.

Lastly though I'd mention you may consider just destroying the node(s) and recreating them, relying on a good image cache to work correctly.  I think after a couple more months, we will have really good support for very-long-lived nodes (those that change a lot as they're interacted with, etc), with features like animating between ASLayoutSpecs, but today it is a little inconvenient to achieve some of those implementations (almost anything is possible with today's ASDK, as long as you're willing to get manual enough...so that's what I'm aiming to fix).

Would love to meet up with you soon in the city if you're interested.  Your feedback on this stuff would be really valuable to shaping the direction of the project.  Looking towards December and early next year, Pinterest contributions will slowly (at first) start going up and we should be at a pretty good clip by February to continue the really structural improvements.
",appleguy,Adlai-Holler
844,2015-11-14 04:16:33,"@appleguy Excellent! I'm really glad you were looking at this feature already.

Other issues I'm facing: 
- Node thread affinity is the biggest one for my oddball use case, since I keep my nodes alive a while. I made a client-side version of `ASDisplayNodeRespectThreadAffinityOfNode` but since I can't lock the properties, sometimes the node gets loaded mid-block and now it's crash time. Maybe publicize that function as a stop-gap until the new threading model is in?
- Better support for animated scrolling. I've got a table view with a bunch of content, and sometimes we want to scroll the user down to a certain spot. But that range may not be loaded and there's currently no way to request it. In our case it's particularly bad, since we have a screen-sized `tableHeaderView` that acts like a cover for the feed, and so literally 0 nodes are loaded since `tableView:willDisplayNode:` hasn't been called yet.
- It doesn't make toast. Big problem!

Destroying & recreating nodes: I'm worried about the performance implications here. Nodes are cheap, but right now I'm using a functional-style data source where I recompute all my data, using a find-or-create system for nodes. Then I [diff](https://github.com/Adlai-Holler/ArrayDiff) the resulting hierarchy and report the row inserts/deletes to the table view. In order to have this much freedom while keeping the table view involvement minimal _and_ not reusing nodes, I'll need to remember which nodes can stay and which have to be thrown out. 

Meet up: Yeah, let's! Email sent.
",Adlai-Holler,appleguy
844,2015-11-14 05:05:15,"@Adlai-Holler I'm happy to merge in some custom facilities for you, especially if they are out of the way in a more buried header (we might create an ASDisplayNode+Experimental.h or similar).  Go wild!  I would like to better understand your use case that is hitting thread affinity so that I can confirm or deny if my current plan to address that will be both sufficient and elegant.  Your instinct to workaround is correct, though, as I am running behind due to a combination of work / family factors.  So it could take a couple more months for my current plan to address affinity to be landed, although it is actually not a difficult change and could probably be done in less than a single day.

I can understand the fear of costs, but would be happy to share my blend of iOS performance intuition and measurement from past projects.  I'm pretty confident we can solve even the most aggressively challenging performance problems (iPhone 4) without node recreation being the main issue.  In fact, enabling usage of layer-backing or shouldRasterizeDescendents would be even more impactful by far, because you eventually have to create a node's view otherwise - which even if you're reusing it, is costly.  Even if you can't currently use those features because you depend on views' event handling, there are workarounds to this by delivering basic events through the node hierarchy.

The range current state stuff is related to the need / desire for big refactors to ASRangeController, and I want those to enable 1) virtualization of data so that the AS classes don't /have/ to perform layout / measurement on everything in the asyncDataSource, AKA the allocation + measurement range; 2) simultaneously, would be trivial to support ""block until measured"" for something like ""scroll to indexPath"" - then finishing up the measurement to that point, update the underlying UIKit component, and issue the command.

2) in fact would be fairly easy to do today, with some careful changes to ASDataController, but if you have some other workaround to this then it's probably reasonable.  You could definitely use a synchronous reloadDataImmediately, which waits on the concurrent completion of all measurement, and would thus provide better performance than UITableView while still ensuring all rows are available to animate to from the start.  If you also enable neverShowPlaceholders on the ASCellNodes, you can trade framerate for full content display.
",appleguy,Adlai-Holler
844,2015-11-16 06:57:34,"@Adlai-Holler ok, I did make really important progress on this over the weekend, but a mid-level family emergency has come up and prevented me from finishing.  No worries, I will not get my priorities wrong in this case - family is always first.

Basically I have a new API designed, ASInterfaceState, which is an NS_OPTIONS bitfield type and will be provided on at least ASDisplayNode as well as ASViewController.  I have a slew of integrations / improvements planned as well.  The upshot is that even after the first diff before the followups, it should be trivial for the implementation of the network / multiplex node to check whether its _interfaceState includes ""ASInterfaceStateFetchData"", and it will trigger a download if so.  In the short term I'm going to keep the -fetchData and -clearFetchedData methods, but they will now be called as part of setInterfaceState: rather than directly from the range handler - and a savvy implementer could override setInterfaceState: to do custom logic, as long as super is called.

- The mapView property is now a MKMapView rather than a ASDisplayNode
- The mapSize property has been removed. If developers wish to set an explicit size for ASMapNode, then they can set the preferredFrameSize property.
- ""automaticallyReloadsMapImageOnOrientationChange"" has been renamed to ""needsMapReloadOnBoundsChange""
- ""-addAnnotations:"" has been renamed ""setAnnotations:""

- ASMapNode now automatically fetches a new map snapshot if it's size is changed, as opposed to only on orientation change.

What are the values for rangeTuningParameters?  What do you have onscreen; just a vertical collection view, or does it also contain horizontally scrolling elements?

Note this is the expected behavior:
- layoutSpecThatFits should be called well in advance of the working range; this is actually called ""as quickly as possible"" for all nodes in the data source.  If you add items, then it should be called shortly after that - EVEN IF the user doesn't scroll.  This is not controlled by ranges.
- fetchData / display - these are called by the ranges (Network and Render ranges).  You can also implement -clearFetchedData or -clearContents if you want to see when things are falling out of the ranges.
- layout (the actual layout ""application"" method) - this is called only when cells come onscreen.  It should be extremely fast, since the measurement pass (-layoutSpecThatFits:) has already happened.  It should be called only when cells are coming onscreen for all iOS versions and devices.

This doesn't appear to be any issue with layout not being performed, simply rendering catching up.  You can use .backgroundColor or other features like .placeholderImage to customize the appearance of the image area before the decoding is finished.

 in my mind `layout` method load all the view and put subviews to the memory.similar to `viewDidLoad` in `UIViewController`.  using rangeController cause the defined range of view to be loaded so when you scroll there is no need to initialize and loading them to the memory!  (Am I right?)

if Im right in iOS 7 subsequent cells won't load immediately but on iOS 8 and above works well. see the generated logs.

- Can you add this code to any of our example/ directory projects and see if you can make it reproduce?  I would love to debug the crash.
- Please provide the crashing backtrace / any other console logs that are generated.
- To use UIPageControl, you have two options:
  -- Create a simple ASDisplayNode wrapper using [[ASDisplayNode alloc] initWithViewBlock: [provide a block that creates and returns a UIPageControl]]
  -- Simply create the UIPageControl directly in the -didLoad method of a node.  Simply do [node addSubview:pageControl], which is equivalent to [node.view addSubview:pageControl].  It's important to do this in -didLoad if you go this route, as that is called on the main thread once the view is created; in init for the node, you should never call into UIKit directly.  If you go this route, you will need a manual -layout method - but you can call super (and still use layoutSpecThatFits!), positioning just the page control in the -layout method.

The benefit of wrapping in the node is that you can more easily handle the page control before the nodes have loaded, including use the -layoutSpecThatFits method to position it.

If you are using ASLayoutSpec, take a look at ASStaticLayoutSpec.

About the layouts i'm using ASStackLayoutSpec with direction horizontal to make the texts inline. The solution with ASRelativeDimension has solved my problem. Thanks

Try pod install again and /please reopen this task/ if it does not address the issue.

833,2015-11-11 04:18:33,"@bimawa Good question.  There isn't currently a way to use layout specs at the ASViewController level.  For now, you must subclass the ASDisplayNode that you create the ASViewController with and use layoutSpecThatFits: there.

In the future I'm most likely going to make ""node"" a writable property (similar to ""view"" in UIViewController), rather than required only at init time.  This won't really affect layout, but is just FYI since you're interested.

We'll probably eventually introduce a layoutSpecForNodeThatFits: or something similar, but this is less certain and wouldn't be part of 2.0 (more likely 2.1 or later).

",appleguy,yxztj
814,2015-11-07 00:31:31,"Thanks for your suggestion @nguyenhuy. I am going to have to spend some time building a test project or something to try this out. You may be on to something here, but I also think it may have something to do with the frame of the ASCollectionView. Putting it inside a ASCollectionNode to put it in a cell, I couldn't find a good way to lay it out properly via the `calculateSizeThatFits` and `layout`. This is kinda hacky, but I was storing the size of the collection view's frame on initialization since it crashes when you try to access the collectionNode's view in calculateSizeThatFits/layout.


",tettoffensive,nguyenhuy
814,2015-11-08 04:43:13,"@tettoffensive Yes, you're right, this is absolutely an issue.  Today, collectionNodes typically need to be calculated without being able to consider their children because they depend on UIKit to drive the layout calls.  There are definitely ways we could adjust the framework to fix this — in fact, ASFlowLayoutController already exists and would allow us to do exactly that for UICollectionViewFlowLayout nodes — but it can't work in the general case unless we were to stop supporting UICollectionViewLayout subclasses.  There are so many advantages to either way (reusing them is great, but they bring several annoying limitations).

Pinterest will further optimize its grid layout in the future, most likely next spring, and I expect this will involve moving away from UICollectionViewLayout & UICV itself in favor of an ASLayoutController-like implementation (and a new custom class to pair with data & range controllers).  That's all pretty far out, but there are much smaller changes that could allow you to call into the ASFlowLayoutController concurrently.

All this said, many of the use cases I expected for ASCollectionNode don't depend on the content size — for example, a typical horizontal scroller inside a vertical table / collection will simply be as wide as the screen and often all the items in it have to have the same height for the UI to look reasonable.

I would be very interested in learning more about your use case, so that I can have a visual mental model of the flexibilities that would have made this properly elegant for you.  Bummed the framework let you down here, and definitely a high priority for me to finish polishing the rough edges of the rather new ASViewController and ASCollectionNode.
",appleguy,tettoffensive
814,2015-11-09 19:29:14,"@appleguy My use case is a vertical table view with each row being a horizontal collection of custom nodes which are basically images with captions on top of them. Each row also has a custom node which is a label for that collection. Right now, I have those as part of the cell in the table view, but I suppose each row could be a section as well. Right now the design is consistent with height. However, who knows what'll happen with the design. Things are always changing. At one point one of the bottom most of the collection views was 2 columns with vertical scroll.

But for simplicities sake right now I'd just like to get the simple case of horizontal collections inside vertical table view. What you're planning for next spring will be nice, but I'll need to find a good solution now in the meantime.

",tettoffensive,appleguy
814,2016-04-04 00:35:30,"@tettoffensive we have the same design in Pinterest  and are able to implement it fairly easily. The solution we use is to request each cell node, call measureWithSizeRange: on them, and take the maximum returned.

If you retain a reference to the cell nodes and then return the same objects when the data sources queried, this can be quite efficient. Often the best time to perform this work is on a background network person thread as soon as the data comes back from the server, perform the layout to understand what the height of the element is and you also get the node creation accomplish in the background.

It does not look like you need the actual content size of the collection, which unfortunately depends on the collection layout and that is a main thread API as restricted by Apple. If you are more interested in the calculated sizes of all of the cell nodes, so that you can perform a maximum on them, this would be far easier to expose in the API.

814,2016-12-11 09:09:18,"@garrettmoon No, unfortunately this is still an issue.  In fact, I'd say it is easily within the top 3 most frequently requested features.  We should open one of those feedback boards where we can have people rank them :).

The use case is as ""simple"" as having a horizontal collection that goes into a vertical scroll view, and wanting to know the height of the overall collection in consideration of its items.  Another is when showing a modal sheet, if it is wrapping a small ASTableNode that may only have 3 or 4 items, calculating the necessary height of the modal can be tough.

@Adlai-Holler had looked into this a bit to see if we could at least provide a well-defined hook that, by its call time, contentSize is set.  It seems like even this is difficult, even after controlling for the async measurement operations, but I'm not exactly sure why.  I'd suggest we consider this for 2.1 as it is a capability that would come from the data controller & layout work that Adlai is hoping to take on.",appleguy,garrettmoon
813,2015-11-04 10:19:15,"@Adlai-Holler Thanks for asking this question. It is definitely a common layout and this issue might be helpful for other developers later on.

Let me try to go through each of the options that you tried and explain why it doesn't work/what is missing.

> Setting cellNode.preferredFrameSize

`preferredFrameSize` won't be picked up because the cell node already implements `-layoutSpecThatFits:`, which is the preferred layout approach. Implementation details can be found [here](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/AsyncDisplayKit/ASDisplayNode.mm#L1574)

> Setting layoutSpec.sizeRange = exact(mySize)

`sizeRange` is _only_ picked up if the layoutable object (`ASLayoutSpec`, `ASDisplayNode` and their subclasses) is a child of an `ASStaticLayoutSpec`. My guess is that you didn't create a static spec. Below piece of code should work:



> Fiddling with ASCenterLayoutSpec's sizing options. Since table views measure cells constrained to (screenWidth, +inf), if I specify Default then the cell is infinitely tall and if I specify Minimum the cell is only as tall as the content.

These look like the correct behaviours of sizing options to me. You can always use an inset spec (between the stack and center specs) to add extra _vertical_ space to your node. This might be a better option over the previous one, since you don't make assumption about the node height (i.e the text can take more space (or even another line) if the font size is bigger, or in different languages, etc)

[DZNEmptyDataSet](https://github.com/dzenbot/DZNEmptyDataSet) seems to be a solid library. Since I haven't used it myself (and am not a top-tier engineer), please take this suggestion with a bit of salt :)

I have the opposite problem where i'm wanting to scroll to the bottom of the table view after the cells have loaded and i can't quite figure out how to do that other than using the following, which seems clearly wrong.  
`self.tableView.insertRowsAtIndexPaths(indexPaths, withRowAnimation: UITableViewRowAnimation.None)`

`self.performSelector(""scrollToBottom"", withObject: nil, afterDelay: 0.25)`

@nguyenhuy what do you think?  It seems important to me that we not have the delegate method called (e.g. nodeForRowAtIndexPath: should definitely not be called due to a -setNeedsLayout on the cell)...and likewise, because removing a node from the hierarchy may cause its contents to be purged, we should also not move the node from one UITableViewCell to another one (if UITableView asks ASTableView for a new cell upon ""reload"")

Although ASDataController has been improved a lot, ASRangeController was written by the same person at the same time, and has not been renovated.  It definitely needs it, and has been on my hitlist for some time now as there are specific additional features that I want from it (including ""visible range"" notifications sent to nodes, which would also better-factor the implementation of neverShowPlaceholders).

Beyond that, we need to formalize these calls that nodes get (like fetchData, clearFetchedData, the display variants, and the proposed visibility variant) in order to be able to trigger them for ASViewController as well.  This may mean defining a new protocol for things that can be controlled by a range.  Then it would be easier to trigger an ASViewController to preload itself to a certain level of completeness (either just fetching network data, or all the way through rendering).

The takeaway for me is that we should come up with a relatively simple bolt-on retrofit for the existing code and then take a step back on ASRangeController in general.

793,2015-10-29 18:54:43,"@Adlai-Holler: 

> Does this mean cells will flash when they resize?

""Reload"" destroys the existing node and loads a new one. ""Relayout"" (as in this PR) means the existing node is reused and only its layout is updated. This PR allows you to pass relayout animation (UITableViewRowAnimation) to a cell node, which will then be passed to ASTableView and the underlying UITableView ([here](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/793/files#diff-4e07fb12c9001054ec63eb1bfd7aa69eR925)). You can also animate the layout changes by wrapping `-setNeedsLayout` inside an animation block (like [this](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/examples/Kittens/Sample/KittenNode.mm#L190)).

> In client apps I specifically avoid calling reloadRowsAtIndexPaths in favor of beginUpdates() / endUpdates() because UITableView seems to flash when reloading rows with animation no matter what you pass.

Yeah, that's because of the delete + insert behaviour. Though you can do some tricks to hide the flash like [this](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/issues/616#issuecomment-133422166), I would recommend avoiding reload methods, as discussed [here](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/issues/616#issuecomment-133422166).

AsyncDisplayKit is in the midst of its evolution from a very raw, high-performance tool that needs to be wielded carefully -- to a highly automatic, convenient set of behaviors that make normal app development easier.  This is a key example where we've not yet fully bridged the gap and made things convenient rather than just powerful.  Another example is the stretching text you see in the videos; this is the current default behavior (more advanced usage can customize this to suit the requirements of the animation).  A better default is probably possible.

> ""When invisible nodes gets removed from shared window?""

The backing store (view or layer, but most likely view in this case) of ~~invisible nodes~~ nodes that fell out of the working range are removed from the shared window by `ASRangeHandlerRender`, but the nodes themselves are still retained by `ASDataController`. They should be deallocated when the data controller deletes them, or when it reloads data.

Yes, but as i see from code, corresponding method of ASRangeHandlerRender is called only when visible range changes due to collection view/table view scroll action.

Any ideas on how we can accomplish this?  @nguyenhuy you may have the best intuition.  Clearly ASLayoutSpec is capable of performing all the calculations needed; we just need to determine what a reasonable specialized behavior is for ASScrollNode and how to integrate it seamlessly in a way that is intuitive.

One way might be: children of ASScrollNodes are given unbounded size in the direction of scrolling, if we can determine the scroll direction at layout time.  Then we need a way to actually set the contentSize, which might be based on using CGRect unions of all of the layout specs / nodes within the scroll node and using the maximum width of that joint rect?
",appleguy,levi
780,2015-11-13 01:13:00,"@nguyenhuy from my quick skimming, seems like a really cool approach! Will all ASScrollViews require that the returned spec is an ASScrollLayoutSpec? How will it identify at layout time that the spec is specific to the content size?
",levi,nguyenhuy
780,2015-12-09 18:18:20,"Sorry for the long delay @levi. I think what we need is an ASScrollNode that holds an UIScrollView and returns an ASScrollLayoutSpec. The node will also take care of setting its contentSize, either in -layout or -layoutDidFinish (not sure yet).

Would it make sense to add the synchronous mode to the Kittens app without duplicating the project?  Maybe even a tab bar controller within the main Kittens app?

If so, you could do a later PR that deletes the new sample project and merges them.  It could actually be a good environment to test ASViewControllers' ability to preload an ASTableView or ASCollectionView before the controller is shown; this is not implemented yet, but needs to be soon.  We could also test neverShowsPlaceholders in such an app.

763,2015-10-24 03:40:41,"@TernTuring thanks for the test project!  I've isolated the issue.

In your test, going back from the view does release most memory — such as ASDataController, which includes all ASDisplayNodes, etc.  However, the ASBasicImageDownloaders do stay alive.

The problem is that NSURLSession has non-standard memory semantics for its delegate property.  It's a strong reference, which actually is the only example of a strong delegate that I can think of in the Cocoa APIs...  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Foundation/Reference/NSURLSession_class/index.html

""The session object keeps a strong reference to the delegate until your app exits or explicitly invalidates the session. If you do not invalidate the session, your app leaks memory until it exits.""

Now the question is how to resolve this correctly.
",appleguy,TernTuring
763,2015-10-26 02:54:02,"@garrettmoon and I are going to investigate integrating PINRemoteImage with ASDK as a solution for this.  If we do so, ASBasicImageDownloader would be powered by PINRemoteImage (or perhaps replaced / removed entirely).

If anyone else has time to investigate a more targeted fix here, which requires some refactoring of ASBasicImageDownloader, it would be appreciated.  @TernTuring I'm pretty confident you could figure out a solution, too; basically we need to use something like a completionBlock instead of a persistent delegate so that the retain cycle is only temporary, and does end when the request finishes or is cancelled.

Try implementing an image downloader yourself with PINRemoteImage or SDWebImage.  Both are projects you can easily install with a pod.  You can make any object in your app the downloader for your ASNetworkImageView (it has an initializer where you pass in a downloader).  The protocol to download images is very simple to forward to either of those frameworks.

Let me know how it goes if you can try.  It shouldn't take more than an hour or so, I'd think (could be missing something, tell me if so)

761,2015-10-21 22:57:09,"@zintus this will require some updates internally to ASDataController such that anything pushed to a background queue (ie. node batch loading and editing transaction queue work) is done on main. While this is indeed a possible feature we could add to the data controller, I would caution against this approach if you're dealing with a lot of cells. The up front rendering cost could potentially block main for a longer period than desired and result in poor initial performance.
",levi,zintus
761,2015-10-21 22:58:45,"@zintus funny that you bring this up, because @garrettmoon just encountered a use case for this earlier today :).  This does make it a priority for the project overall.

The most important thing is to come up with the right API for doing this.  I think in many use cases, what is desired is a single method call that can do a one-shot synchronous load (akin to a -reloadDataImmediately), although a persistent mode that enables always-synchronous behavior is something to think about (I think there are more risks / considerations with this...we'd probably want to force on neverShowPlaceholders for all cell nodes in such a case).
",appleguy,zintus
761,2015-10-21 23:45:35,"Totally agree on having only one synchronous method to do all job related to rendering visible portion of table (taking huge tables in consideration, as pointed by @levi).

Here is how such method could look like:
1) query nodes batch of predefined size on main thread;
2) do batch layout on them, blocking main thread;
3) repeat 1,2 if batch is too small to fill the table;
4) proceed as usual, relying on `neverShowPlaceholders` to render nodes content.

Step 1 implies support for partially updated internal state for table's data, which maybe non-trivial to implement.

Maybe it's worth thinking of this process as of pipeline with heavily parallel stages: query data source for nodes, layout nodes, render nodes. We can easily block main thread, waiting for any stage to complete, similarly to current implementation of batch layout.
",zintus,levi
761,2015-10-22 05:01:47,"@zintus welcome to the design of this capability!  Thanks for contributing to the reasoning process, as your thoughts are clearly articulated and solid.

I'm pretty sure Step 1 will be an easy implementation.  The batch layout system already does something similar; we would need to slightly refactor that mechanism, but it should be pretty feasible to do (the code is very explanatory when read).

It's definitely the right idea to have the method only block on laying out as much content is as needed to fill the screen.  Ironically, the simpler approach I was mentioning before (blocking on sizing everything) would still be faster than UIKit...by parallelizing the height calculations.  It would use more memory, though, and be pretty terrible for large tables.

The only consideration is that it may be necessary to allow specifying an amount of preloading to be synchronous for (this could be expressed in a screen height).  We may just do this by default, but if you loaded only enough for an exact screen height, then on any medium-performance device a natural but brisk swipe upon arriving at the view would be quicker than the next layout batch, and the user could see what looked like an end-of-content scroll bounce.

- Is this in an ASCellNode subclass?
- Why does _captionSize exist?  This is suspect, and indicates the layout system is probably not being used 100% correctly.  It may not be the cause of the issue, but could be related.

I'm thinking that you may need to set a property like flexBasis or flexGrow in order to have the horizontal stack increase its height to the full height the vertical stack would use.

759,2015-10-21 00:19:38,"@robmontesinos note the code snippet you showed doesn't actually show where _captionSize is calculated.  Wherever you're calculating it, it's almost certainly creating a material main thread cost that will affect performance.  I haven't yet run into a situation where it's necessary to do this manually with ASDK; one of the big advantages of the measurement system is that you can use .calculatedSize (or .calculatedLayout) once measurement is done, which is always complete by the time the -layout method is called.
",appleguy,robmontesinos
759,2015-10-21 00:21:59,"@robmontesinos ok, that makes sense then.  I totally understand what's happening now.

The manual setting of the frame is causing a mismatch between measurement and sizing:
- During measurement, the system is assuming you want a single line of text because nothing is telling it otherwise...this may be a bug, we need to investigate the right fix.
- During drawing (which happens after the -layout call, which itself happens after measurement), the system sees that you've given it a specific frame size and then tries to draw the text in the size you've provided.  This results in line wrapping, which was not actually part of the layout calculation.

This should be easy / elegant to fix, but because I'm very new to box model layout myself, I need to think about what the correct solution is.

759,2015-10-21 17:31:51,"@robmontesinos Do you somehow provide a fixed constrained height for each cell node? I asked this question because currently ASTableViewDataSource can't provide different constrained heights for each cells. And without a fixed constrained height (63, right?), the text nodes can grow vertically to wrap their texts. I think it makes sense to have -constrainedHeightForNodeAtIndexPath: in ASTableViewDataSource (note: not constrained size but constrained height, because we want table view cells to always fill the table view width). @appleguy, @rcancro: What do you think?

In case you are curious about why setting ""all three"" works, here is my explanation:
- Since the vertical stack is a child of a horizontal stack, enabling flexShrink on the vertical stack means it can shrink horizontally (flexShrink is effective on the stack direction). So the vertical stack fills the available width.
- The 2 text nodes are children of a vertical stack, so flexShrink means they can shrink vertically and thus fill the available height, which is 63 in this case.

Also, can the caption text (and title text) be really long? If so then it is possible that one of the 2 text nodes (likely titleTextNode because caption text is usually much longer) will be asked to shrink to a very small size that it cannot render even 1 line of text (or even asked to shrink to 0). This is because stack layout spec distributes stack-dimension violations evenly to all of its flexible children. Fortunately, you can easily handle this case. 
- Instead of enabling flexShrink on titleTextNode, you can set its maximumLineCount to 1 (or maybe 2). This change causes titleTextNode to always have enough space to render at most 1 line, and captionTextNode can fill the remaining height.
- Or if the caption is optional, you can just disable flexShrink on titleTextNode. This way, titleTextNode will take as much (vertical) space as it wants.

And of course, feel free to ask if you have problems with more complex layouts. We are happy to help :)

Since flexShrink is used against the stack dimension of the parent stack, I think this can confuse other developers. For example, if all children in a vertical stack can shrink (vertically), that doesn't always mean the vertical stack itself should shrink horizontally (if added inside a horizontally stack). It is true in @robmontesinos's layout because he happens to want a fixed height, but not in other (normal) cases.

757,2015-10-20 20:19:45,"@wy19901227 do you mean, why are they not the same width?

The reason is that the text is actually not exactly the same width.  The width of a given character, in this case the digit, does vary a little in most fonts.  Only in true Monospace fonts is that not true.

The right way to solve this depends on how you want the design to look.  For example, if you really did want the grey region to not reach to the left and right sides of the screen, you would need to have a mechanism to determine the text that is maximum width and then make sure that all the other ones also adopt that width.

@rcancro I bet there is a way to do this with layout specs, automatically, but I'm not totally sure what it would be...if you imagined that the 0-9 cells were actually all subnodes of a single ASCellNode, and the ASCellNode returned an ASStackLayoutSpec from -layoutSpecThatFits, would it work to set the .flexBasis = ASRelativeDimensionMakeWithPercent(1.0) on each of the text nodes contained by the stack?
",appleguy,wy19901227
757,2015-10-20 20:21:27,"@wy19901227 happy to help, if you can clarify your question / use case a bit more.  Something important to keep in mind here is that there are fewer layout options available for positioning multiple ASCellNodes relative to each other...as compared to positioning things that are a subnode added to an ASLayoutSpec.

In a case like this you might want to subclass UICollectionViewLayout to provide additional logic, if it's not possible / desirable to return a single ASCellNode for each group of 10 objects and then position the 10 objects using an ASLayoutSpec.
",appleguy,wy19901227
757,2015-10-21 03:01:06,"@wy19901227 The demo isn't designed to make them all the same width while centered, of course, but it is definitely possible to do this.

If you want to set a static size, you should be able to do so in a few different ways.
- Subclass ASTextCellNode (better yet, create your own subclass from ASCellNode) and return an ASStaticLayoutSpec from the -layoutSpecThatFits: method.
- Alternatively, your subclass may use -calculateSizeThatFits: (returns a simple CGSize, where you can set any value you want the cell to be).  This approach requires that you also define a -layout method to position the text node (just like layoutSubviews).
- You might be able to use preferredFrameSize.
- We could definitely extend ASTextCellNode to provide a property to support this without subclassing.  However, ASTextCellNode is not a very useful class - it's basically a demo / test class not intended for real use cases - so i'm not sure it makes sense to expand its feature set rather than have you create your own cell if you want custom behaviors such as a size that is not defined by the text.

Lastly, you should experiment with properties like .flexGrow; setting this on the text node or cell might make it default to spanning the screen width.
",appleguy,wy19901227
757,2015-10-21 23:09:25,"@wy19901227 your code is missing a few things.

You need a -layout method if you are going to use -calculateSizeThatFits:.  Refer to pages 20-30 of the attached slide deck.

The screenshot doesn't show the rest of the file but it is not clear if you are adding the _textNode as a subnode of the cell, or allocating it properly.

Please share a test project so that we can debug it and get to a solution.  Otherwise, think about the amount of information you're providing and try to give more so that someone without the code could take a guess at what is wrong.  For example, you should print out the view hierarchy and include that here so we can at least see that the text node is present.  This is as simple as ""po [[UIWindow keyWindow] recursiveDescription]"" (or using Xcode's capture view hierarchy command in the debug menu, or other techniques).

757,2015-10-22 03:22:44,"@wy19901227 ah, I see.  Yes, that makes sense, because you have removed the code that sets the position of the text node.

If you use -calculateSizeThatFits:, you must also implement a -layout method to set the frame of any subnodes (such as the text node.

-layoutSpecThatFits:, as well as -calculateLayoutThatFits:, handle this task for you (do not need to implement a -layout method).

If you want to use one of the options that doesn't require -layout, consider using an ASStaticLayoutSpec to replace the ASInsetLayoutSpec.  Or, implement -calculateLayoutThatFits: (look at ASLayout to understand the data type it returns).

If you keep -calculateSizeThatFits, it will be a very short method.  Just call [super layout], and then set the frame of the text node in the exact same way you would in -layoutSubviews.

I don't think this is caused by ASDK. As you guys may already know, a `UICollectionViewDataSource` is required to update its data before a batch-updates block returns (and `ASDataController` rightfully conforms to this requirement). However, `UICollectionView indexPathsForVisibleItems` (which is [used by `ASCollectionView visibleNodes`](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/AsyncDisplayKit%2FASCollectionView.mm#L384)) doesn't return a list of updated index paths until _after_ the last call of `collectionView:willDisplayNodeForItemAtIndexPath`, and _before_ the first call of `collectionView:didEndDisplayingNodeForItemAtIndexPath`. And because of this UICollectionView's behaviour, it's actually not safe to call `indexPathsForVisibleItems` (and therefore `visibleNodes`) in `willDisplayNodeForItemAtIndexPath`.

755,2015-10-28 23:43:53,"@nguyenhuy fascinating details!  I definitely did not know that.

These call order / API guarantee subtleties can be extremely complex to figure out for many developers, as it often doesn't seem like the most plausible cause of a given issue.  It's not actually about bad developers (it should be very clear that nvh can debug / derive these kind of implied behaviors / call orders), but more about the set of assumptions and expectations you approach an API with.

Can anyone think of a way that we can better document stuff like this, even though it is actually a UIKit behavior / limitation?  I'm not sure if an assertion or log message makes sense, but it might, if an edit transaction were recently submitted and the developer is asking for visible\* when we know it will not have been updated.

Would you be able to create a sample project, or modify one of the existing examples/ directory projects (like the Kittens app) to reproduce it?  It seems like you'd mainly need to add a UINavigationController, and push another table view onto it, then do the Instruments checking to make sure it has the issue.

A simple way to do this would be to hack the Kittens app so that the button in the navigation bar (set on the navItem) simply pushes a second copy / new instance of the Kittens view controller.

Are you doing this from the very beginning of the table's existence, like when the containing view controller allocates it, or are you changing the size after it's been used for a while?

",appleguy,robmontesinos
750,2015-10-21 03:08:06,"@robmontesinos the use case certainly makes sense, so thanks for describing that earlier.  I definitely understand what you're trying to accomplish, was just unclear on what was not working about it.

After you set the frame, have you gone and printed the frame of the table view in the debugger right afterwards?  Is the value of the frame rectangle correct at least, even if the table on screen is not affected?

Lastly, why not put the iAd view over the top of the table view, and just change the contentInset alone?  That said, you should definitely be able to resize it.

Keep in mind if you have the ASTableView set as the .view property of a UIViewController, then it will quite possibly be re-set by UIKit to the larger frame size.  That should also happen with UITableView if you're doing manual layout.  Maybe there is magical behavior with auto layout in that use case.

Perhaps you can do a ""po [[UIWindow keyWindow] recursiveDescription]"" and share the results here — running that command in the debugger / after / you've put the iAd view onscreen and have run the method to change the frame of the table.
",appleguy,robmontesinos
750,2015-10-21 04:32:10,"@robmontesinos very glad to see the bug — awesome.  You may consider evaluating a different approach to avoiding the issue, though, because viewWillLayoutSubviews is called multiple times during the app's runtime.  I don't think the code you posted will work in 100% of cases particularly if the app experiences memory warnings and views are unloaded, etc.
",appleguy,robmontesinos
750,2015-10-21 04:37:02,"@robmontesinos the problem is that you aren't always setting it.  For example if the view unloaded and were reloaded, unless you manually reset the didLoad property, could leave the table at CGRectZero size.

I don't understand the exact situation that lead to the multiple calls to the method in your case and somehow un-did the correct frame.  However, the code should be written in such a way that with each run of -viewWillLayoutSubviews, the correct value for the ASTableView's frame is set (same as with general UIKit layout, not meant to be specific to ASTableView).
",appleguy,robmontesinos
750,2015-10-21 04:39:29,"@appleguy I see why you are saying. Is there a reason I shouldn't set the tableView frame in viewDidLoad?

If you don't have the animation, does the node's contents properly show up in the cell?  E.g., it is being positioned and sized properly in layout, and is not marked hidden or something else?

Where are you actually triggering / starting the animation?  Naturally, make sure it is not on a background thread, as some ASDK callbacks are run on.
",appleguy,petrpavlik
749,2015-10-21 03:23:00,"@petrpavlik thanks for the link to the code!  Reading through, I can see how incompetent I am with Swift.  I don't fully understand the method that contains the animation call, because it is creating a UIView, yet is somehow related to ASDisplayNode...this doesn't seem right, as you should be accessing the view property of the ASDisplayNode rather than creating one.

In addition / more importantly, it's not OK to call into UIKit from the -init method.  This may be called off the main thread, and for example cell nodes are initialized and then go through a concurrent background measurement pass before they're even added to a view hierarchy.  Your animation may be short-circuiting in some way because the views / layers aren't actually in a hierarchy so the animation couldn't have an affect immediately (not totally sure what UIKit is designed to do in that edge case).

It is also unusual to have animations start automatically just because something is created, but I understand you want this to be an infinite animation.  Still, classes like UIActivityIndicatorView have some kind of -start method for this, so you should consider that possibility.

If you'd like it to begin automatically, try using either -willEnterHierarchy or -didLoad method (each is called by ASDK automatically).  Make sure you call super.

Please let me know if you aren't able to solve the issue, and bring any additional details about the behaviors you observe.  I will try to modify the app to make it work if you aren't successful.  Good luck and thanks for asking!

749,2015-10-21 15:07:37,"@appleguy This piece of code



Is just Swift syntax for `- (id)initWithViewBlock:(ASDisplayNodeViewBlock)viewBlock;` so I suppose that it's a correct implementation.

I spent some more time digging into the implementation and found out that adding an item is wrapped inside `ASPerformBlockWithoutAnimation` which explains why I could get my view to animate :).

I made it work by triggering the animation in dispatch_async inside layoutSubviews to jump out of the performWithoutAnimation block.


",petrpavlik,appleguy
749,2015-10-22 01:05:31,"@petrpavlik ohhhh, thanks for explaining the initWithViewBlock thing.  That really didn't make much sense hehe.

This can definitely be done without using initWithViewBlock.  Using layoutSubviews as a trigger is not exactly ideal, although will definitely work.  You might want it to be a dispatch_once as relayout passes may occur without warning and could reset the animation.

Additionally, it is very important to avoid using .cornerRadius whenever possible.  This and several other layer properties (like borders, paths, etc) is extremely expensive; it is applied in the compositor, on every frame (even if the content isn't changing, merely scrolling a .cornerRadius view will cause the clipping to be re-applied on every frame).  This is disastrously expensive for any scrolling view up through at least iPhone 5, and I have seen it degrade performance below 60FPS on iPhone 5S.  The severity of the effect depends on a number of factors, including the size of the view, so if there were a case to use it during prototyping...this would be the one.

Recommend that you create a simple drawing routine using UIGraphicsBeginImageContext() and create the dot, then toss it in an ASImageNode, for example.
",appleguy,petrpavlik
749,2015-10-29 02:53:39,"@petrpavlik I'm not sure what the normal behavior of autoreversing animations is on backgrounding the app, but I wouldn't be surprised if it does pause / cancel them.  Instead of reloading the table, which is quite expensive, I'd strongly encourage you to come up with a more targeted solution.  One would be to subscribe to the NSNotification sent by UIApplication when the app is foregrounded, and you can restart the animation there.  Make sure you unsubscribe from the notification when the cell is not onscreen.

747,2015-10-16 19:57:48,"@wy19901227 No, UIKit auto layout is not supported.  However, ASDK provides a variety of ASLayoutSpec objects that allow implementing automatic layout which is more efficient (multithreaded, off the main thread), easier to debug (can step into the code and see where all values come from, as it is open source), and reusable (you can build composable layouts that can be shared with different parts of the UI).

Because of the way that UIKit auto layout is implemented, it actually prevents all major UI frameworks for iOS from integrating with it.  So, the story is the same with React Native and ComponentKit, for example.

Lastly, I think it's worth noting that using UIKit Autolayout is not permitted in large / experienced iOS development environments, including Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest.  It is too computationally inefficient and difficult to debug.

I'm aware that the master version number is set to 1.2.2, even though the latest release branch is 1.2.3.  That is just an error, although one that doesn't affect functionality.  I'll update it now.

I'll also look at the source_files piece, but the thing that concerns me is that other developers have not had this issue and are building against ASDK master...including Pinterest, NFL, Yahoo, and others.

Importantly, 1.2.3 (or if you just do ""pod AsyncDisplayKit"") does NOT include the Layout directory...it does not support many of the newer features that are on master.  You need to point to a commit, or another way of specifying it in the Podfile, if you want that newer version of the framework.

742,2015-10-15 02:16:44,"@robmontesinos reading your comment more carefully, it does indeed indicate what I suspect.  Because the console is saying 1.2.3 installed, that definitely means that your configuration is not pointing to master, or indeed any version that has the Layout directory available.  So, if you want to use something like ASLayoutSpec (new developments past 1.2.3), you need to point to master and the console will (for the current moment) say 1.2.2 installed.  Apologies for the slight inaccuracy of the version number, as we've been focused more on getting the functionality built out and planning future releases than the state of the pod config in the master branch (since that's not a real release at all, it does not have a version number).

What functionality are you trying to use that is not present in the 1.2.3 version?  ASTableView is certainly there...

Feel free to check out the 1.2.3 branch (you can download a zip here for convenience: https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/tags https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/tags) and you could pull those two files from that version, and they should build fine.

I just created a new tag, 1.9, if you want to try to point to that instead.  Most developers who want to use the latest ASDK features are pointing to a random specific commit on master and are using the new classes like ASLayoutSpec, but if you are not actively looking at the functionality that has been added since 1.2.3, this wouldn’t be necessary.

It is taking some work to get off of auto layout and implement/understand calculateSizeThatFits: and layout but so far it has been worth it in terms of smoother scrolling. I am going to try to do fade in animation with POP since placeholderFadeDuration doesn't seem to be doing anything but that is a different issue. @appleguy  - YOU ROCK!!

742,2015-10-19 02:14:32,"@robmontesinos haha, very glad to hear it!  I have a git tag set for the 1.9 release now — working hard to get the release out ASAP, but I keep running out of time due to other things.  Please make sure you are pointing to that tag (or any commit on master in recent days) to ensure you have the most refined version of ASDK.

If you are going to start converting other code to ASDK, I strongly recommend you use the new layout functionality.  E.g., don't use -calculateSizeThatFits + -layout; instead, using -layoutSpecThatFits (best for most cases), or use -calculateLayoutThatFits: (allows fully manual layout, but still eliminates the duplication between calculateSize / layout).  Either of these two new approaches gets rid of the repeated code between size calculation and layout, which is a big win for brevity, maintainability, and allows the framework to achieve really excellent layout-related performance.

You can look at the examples/Kittens app, as KittenNode does use layout specs for its layout.  There is also a project URL mentioned in the slide deck later on (on the Swift slide) where ASLayoutSpec is used extensively, but it is written in Swift.

741,2015-10-14 22:02:18,"@MrS3 naturally a cache is necessary if you want images to be stored for much longer than the time they are onscreen.  Caching has costs — either memory, or on disk space, and have different performance characteristics — so it wouldn't be reasonable for ASDK to try to solve that problem in a generic way.  Apps have /extremely/ different needs when it comes to memory usage and caching.

You have a good lead on the answer...the ASImageCacheProtocol is provided as a surprisingly easy way to plug into the ASDK components and implement any caching strategy you would like.  I believe somewhere in the framework there is a default / basic image cache you can use, but this may not have been finished.

Thanks for posting and please do open another issue if you have a more specific question on integrating with the caching protocol!  Also welcome any PRs implementing a simple NSCache-based image cache if the framework doesn't currently provide one.

739,2015-10-14 19:58:51,"@lappp9 thanks a lot for providing a test project!  This is a cool one — someday if you wanted to include it in our examples/ directory, it could be a great addition (don't worry, wouldn't do that without you).

The +1 does appear to be within the grey circle.  You mean it's not exactly centered?  Note that ""visual"" centering of text is pretty hard, because the actual bounding box (space required by the font to accommodate both ascenders and descenders of other characters) is not identical to the visual extent of the character.

I think there is a special property on ASTextNode that allows you to get the visual bounding box, but I'm not sure offhand and would have to look.  It would not be very hard to implement, as the figures are available from lower level CoreText calls.

Same question about the likes — what are they supposed to be aligned with?  It is likely the same kind of issue; text alignment doesn't always work in the way that you want, which is of course equally true with UILabel.  If you were able to get the alignment working perfectly with UIKit using -layoutSubviews or similar, you should also feel confident about not using ASLayoutSpecs for a design that requires careful positioning of text (usually text is not inside of an element that is so small as that circle that it needs to be pixel-centered; the text inside of buttons is often not exactly visually centered).  Instead you could use -calculateLayoutThatFits: or even -calculateSizeThatFits: + -layout, and either approach would allow you to avoid using explicit Static layout specs.

I don't have a chance to run the project until probably this weekend, but do recommend that you set a .backgroundColor on all the important elements involved here to see visually where the extent of their bounds is and therefore observe the rectangles being used by the layout system for positioning.

730,2015-10-10 22:13:13,"@hashemp206 what effect are you trying to achieve here?  Presumably you do not want the image stretch out to the taller height, right?  Do you want it to ""reveal"" more of a clipped image?

If you think about it, that's a very different interaction than just expanding a view with an existing backing store.  You need some mechanism for the system to have the fully-decoded image in memory, but dynamically clipping it, then animate the area that is clipped to reveal more.  This is possible, in two separate ways that can be recommended, but can't be done by setting the bounds of the image (try it with UIImageView, or CALayer with its contents set, too — it won't work there either).

The two approaches, easiest and then slightly harder but more efficient:
1. Put the image node inside of another node (same for an image view, inside of another view).  Enable .clipsToBounds on the outside / containing view.  At the start of the animation, set the frame of the inside image node to the full size it needs to expose, and then call -displayImmediately on it to force the full thing to display before the animation starts.  You could leave the inside image node always at full height, and it would look correct because the containing element has clipsToBounds enabled, but this would mean that a large amount of additional memory is used even if the user never expands the image.  ASImageNode is smart enough to automatically save memory by decoding the image directly to the size available to the node, so it will be more efficient if you set its frame to be smaller.
--- Then once the image is fully displayed (the containing node will still be clipping it), you can simply animate the bounds / size of the containing node, and it will smoothly reveal the rest of the image.
1. Something you can do with a single element (whether layer, view, or node) — is a special property on CALayer called contentsCenter that allows you to specify what part of the backing store should be used.  It takes some careful manipulating but you can use this to achieve the effect.  Probably not the best way to go for this implementation though.

As always, feel free to upload a test project so we can work more quickly on this stuff.

Does your code have any reference to contentsScaleForDisplay, if you do a full text search of the project?

So I'm not sure what the desired behavior is, that you would like it to have, to get from the placeholder state to the final state.  Happy to help figure it out once I better understand the intended behavior!

Look at the examples/Kittens app for some examples of cell resizing and relayout.  When you tap on a cell, it does a relayout, which involves calling -invalidateCalculatedLayout and calling -reloadRowAtIndexPath:.

@nguyenhuy sorry to ask again, but could you remind me if there were any other method calls required here?  The ASTableView /SHOULD/ be able to detect that the cell has an invalidated layout, and requires a synchronous measure pass as part of the row reload, but does it do that right now?  Lastly, can you think of an API improvement we can make for this to be a one-line call?  Two ideas for that:
          - Method on ASCellNode, like ""reload"" (but different name), that triggers a full relayout /and/ messages the owning ASTableView or ASCollectionView to reload its index path.
          - Method on each ASTableView and ASCollectionView to ""relayoutAndAnimateHeightForIndexPath:"" or something.

716,2015-10-06 18:27:45,"@RuiAAPeres This is actually a high priority feature that I would like to add to the framework, and has an immediate use case in the Pinterest app.  I would like to provide an out-of-the-box paging component that can take either nodes or view controllers (especially ASViewControllers, as they provide the important -neverShowPlaceholders option that some developers may need).  Supporting regular UIViewControllers wouldn't be hard.

I think the right approach is a subclass of ASCollectionNode, called ASPagerNode or something, which sets up the UICollectionViewFlowLayout automatically.

Assuming you are talking about full-screen paging, it may be important to change the default values for rangeTuningParameters to dial back how much is done to render-ahead, and how long it waits to clear contents for stuff going offscreen.

You should definitely override the -clearContents or -clearFetchedData methods to participate in the memory-culling features.  The existence of the UIViewController object itself, along with the ASCellNode itself, should be an absolutely negligible amount of memory — even with over 1,000 objects, it should be at most a few megabytes, nowhere close to enough to be the primary cause of memory pressure.  I would love to help debug any memory pressure issues if you are unable to determine why they are happening.  If you have everything hooked up with nodes, without the UIViewController in between (e.g. you use an ASCellNode directly), then all the image nodes / text nodes / etc will free their large memory-hogging backing stores automatically (they override the methods I mentioned).

There is a little bit of trickiness to working with UIViewController in this context.  It breaks the node hierarchy and so that could affect delivery of these critical recursive notifications.  One solution for this would be to provide an ASViewControllerNode, taking a UIViewController and providing a ""node"" object that you can put in the node hierarchy.  We would want to think a little bit about the API here and how it relates to ASViewController, understanding that some superclasses (UITableViewController, etc) can't be easily switched to be ASViewController-deriving.  The medium-term strategy I've had here is to provide AS versions for those small numbers of key Apple-provided classes where the superclass can't be changed (table, collection, etc view controllers).  For other controllers, developers should generally have the ability to do the trivial swap of the superclass from UIViewController to ASViewController without breaking /any/ existing use cases, so I think that could be the right strategy as some of this comes together.

If we did rely on ASViewController, then we could provide a .node property in a built-in way, and wouldn't need the confusing-sounding ASViewControllerNode.  Another way to avoid that unfortunate class would be manually implementing a -node method on your own UIViewController subclasses (maybe this could be done in a category method on UIViewController!), and creates the node with -initWithViewBlock:, where it sets the node.view = self.view (view controller being self) — that could work really well.

Sorry for the rambling, writing from a meeting (lol).  I would really love to work with you or anyone else interested in pulling together an official solution for the ""paging"" use case, as it is a phenomenally impactful use case for ASDK (avoiding the universally problematic interaction stall on each swipe as the next offscreen controller is loaded on the main thread).  Let me know what you think, and if you're interested in doing some of the work to commit back to the project (it should be a medium-sized project, not huge).  Don't worry at all if you can't do that right now, as I'll start asking around the community to look for someone who might be able to help.  Since you have a use case in addition to Pinterest's, that's enough for me to feel like it is time to prioritize this work and reach a solution in the next week or (max) two.
",appleguy,RuiAAPeres
716,2015-10-06 20:40:53,"@RuiAAPeres thanks for the details!  I better understand your use case now that I see the ASTableView there.

Unfortunately, this will be a little more complicated than I described, mainly because of the table view.  If you were to use a vertically-scrolling ASCollectionNode instead, it would work more smoothly.  I am planning to add an ASTableNode, which will be very trivial to create (10 minutes or so), but it's not there.  So, not going to obscure the facts: this use case (particularly containing UIViewControllers) is NOT well supported by ASDK today, and there are a slew of small and medium-sized changes needed to enable it.

I'll make it a priority to map out the work needed here, such as some of the more tricky API design questions.  Is this an active blocker for your work today, or would it be OK if we started making progress on it next week?  It will probably take me until the end of this weekend to properly design an API direction here, although I may be able to also execute some of that direction.  With luck, next week we can have a couple community members (maybe 1-2 others and yourself, if available), to finish up the work within a few days.

In terms of -clearFetchedData, I wasn't sure. My rationale was, don't cancel the image request since we don't currently cancel the image download, but now that I type that out it's pretty weak sauce. Should I go ahead and cancel the image request there? Should I also cancel the image download as well?

That's definitely one of the points of the method.  Of course, we should probably be canceling the request in -clearContents as well, which theoretically should be called before -clearFetchedData in most cases anyway, but when content enters the network range and then scrolls out by a reversal of direction it's still appropriate to cancel it.

I think, a good docs could be extracted from these discussions afterwards.

So, my next step is to refactor layout in each of `nodes`.
If I start from the bottom one (violet) `actionBarNode`:
Where should I call `measureWithSizeRange` ?
If I call it in `layoutSpecThatFits` of parent node, the output of `constrainedSize` in method `layoutSpecThatFits` of child node has still minimum of `zeroSize`, the node collapses.

But when I specify `preferredFrameSize` inside the node itself, it does own layout more or less correctly.

712,2015-11-17 18:33:22,"@appleguy I've finished the layout and performance optimization, but still there are some stalls on iPad 3. I find the reason for stalls is high CPU usage, but not blocking the main thread (in that case CPU usage is usually low).

I haven't looked at ASDK architecture in deep, but it seems that the high amount of view initializations being performed during high-speed scrolling is the case for slowdown. 

This is the same layout implemented in UIKit with cell reuse and it seems to be stall-free:
https://github.com/RamonGilabert/Wall

I think that ASDK was simply not best fit for this kind of layout - the cells are exactly the same, without any layout difference. ASDK would fit views that have rich content layout that is different across the elements of collection, where cell-reuse pattern is difficult to implement.

Here are all performance improvements made by me:

A small number of the features are things that would fit nicely within the mental model / implementation framework of ASLayoutSpec / ASLayoutable, so if there are any that jump out to you as particularly valuable let's get them written down as feature requests in the Issues section!

I'll write a note about how to lay out the example above as soon as I can (just in a meeting now).  @rcancro or @nguyenhuy may get to it before me.
",appleguy,hashemp206
709,2015-10-05 22:22:57,"@hashemp206 you should be able to implement this with two ASStackLayoutSpecs.
1. Create an ASDisplayNode subclass for the containing area, marked in blue in your diagram.
2. Override the method -layoutSpecThatFits:
3. Create an ASStackLayoutSpec that is horizontal (for the overall cell), and another one that is vertical (for the text labels)
4. Set justifyContent on the horizontal stack to ASStackLayoutJustifyContentEnd, to have items push to the right.
5. Use ASInsetLayoutSpec, if needed, to wrap the rounded rect node on the right hand side.  If needed, you can also wrap the vertical layout spec using an inset.
6. Lastly, the vertical layout spec should have each text node added to it.  Set alignItems to ASStackLayoutAlignItemsEnd to make them right-aligned.

If you have any trouble, I can write a code sample for this.  My apologies if I mis-typed or was unclear in any part of this description — let me know how it goes!

I'll give you free debugging help with high priority! :)  I can guarantee you the problems can be solved, but it's impossible for me to fix them with the information that you've given (there are many types of implementation bugs that could cause stuff to not show up in an iOS app, even without ASDK :-P)

I'm logging off for tonight, but do another iteration to see how far you can get now that the labels are showing up correctly.  If you have any questions on justifyContent, alignItems, etc - Google those terms and you'll quickly find documentation related to CSS / ""Flexbox"", and it turns out the same layout rules & property naming scheme is used with AsyncDisplayKit.  Just check out ASStackLayoutable for some additional options to control the behavior of individual items in a stack, in addition to the options on the stack itself (ASStackLayoutSpec).

709,2015-10-12 18:59:26,"@zdenektopic no worries, it's an interesting experiment!  ASDK's asynchronous layout is driven by a method called -measureWithSizeRange.
",appleguy,zdenektopic
709,2015-10-14 23:47:21,"@zdenektopic hmm, no, not sure where you got that sense.  If you use ASTableView or ASCollectionView, the measurement is automatically done in the background — and is in fact parallelized across each cell, doing layout independently across multiple cores.  Check out ASDataController for some of the code (not important for clients of the framework, just implementation details).

You can call -measureWithSizeRange: yourself if you are not using those two classes.  If you do it yourself, it's best to dispatch it to a background thread and then jump back to the main thread when done, to install the view objects.  It really depends on what you need, though.  If you are tapping a button and it's supposed to immediately show an object, then calling -measure... on the main thread is probably the right architecture (that way the button stays highlighted and nothing else happens until the user's action is serviced).

I would suggest we not touch queue priorities for now.  The dispatch headers actually talk about the risk of priority inversion and in at least one place recommend not using priorities unless absolutely necessary.  The main thread already runs at a higher priority, so there is no real risk of dropping frames from this background thread work.  More importantly, if we run at lower priority, it's likely that arbitrary developers' own background tasks (compressing analytics data to send over the network, JSON parsing, etc) could be taking CPU time away from layout, which the user may well be waiting on (at the end of the scrollable area, awaiting for new cells to finish layout and be added).

707,2015-10-09 19:31:56,"@Adlai-Holler yes, you should definitely not reuse nodes in the latter sense (between rows).  I think a trivial change is needed (which someone volunteered to do in a discussion recently, but I think was not completed) to support returning a previously-used node if you deleted it and then want to insert it again.  Namely, the layout code should check isNodeLoaded and perform measurement on the main thread for any of those nodes, dispatching the others to the background (still only notifying the UIKit class when contiguous batches of them are done).  Should be very straightforward if you're interested in making that change.
",appleguy,Adlai-Holler
707,2015-10-09 20:04:59,"@appleguy Good to know. I'd be glad to make the change but I've hit a deadlock. Since the main queue waits for the editing transaction queue to drain before each edit command, it's unsafe to dispatch synchronously onto main from the editing transaction queue, which is where _layoutNodes is required to be done. 
",Adlai-Holler,appleguy
707,2015-10-09 20:15:48,"@Adlai-Holler of course.  I think you'll need to iterate over the nodes before they are running in the background to first catch any that have been loaded previously, to do their measurement there.  Definitely agree there are subtleties involved, may even need some kind of property on cellNode like .needsMeasurement?  Keep in mind that @levi  has a big open PR in this area and we may want to wait for that to land, although your change would probably be the easier one to rebase onto his.

",appleguy,marmelroy
703,2015-10-04 20:36:22,"@RuiAAPeres Thanks for the test project!

I think what's happening here is that ASTableView is not properly implemented to handle a nil asyncDelegate.  Clearly that is a bug, because it doesn't trigger an assertion or anything as it exists today.  Looking at the code, what will happen is that key UITableView delegate methods don't get hooked up, because those are done via a proxy object that currently relies on asyncDelegate being set.

You may not like this as a solution, but the easiest fix would be to enforce that asyncDelegate gets set.  There are certainly other ways to fix it that don't require that, but it would take a little more work — and I'm not sure it is the best use of time (relative to other improvements, supporting a nil delegate in ASTableView / ASCollectionView seems of low value).

If you have any interest in attempting a patch that would allow it to support a nil asyncDelegate, by all means, give it a shot!  If not, just let me know and I'll add some assertions to make sure the delegate gets set, a make a TODO or Github Issue to track further improvement.
",appleguy,RuiAAPeres
703,2015-10-04 20:49:00,"@appleguy in order to keep the internals simple, an `Assert` could be the best course of action. Although I will have a look later, on how the proxy is being done and how much changes would be needed to support a `nil` delegate.

A workaround would be to use the method @nguyenhuy mentioned.  It should solve your problem and is a stable solution.  In fact, I'd argue that it is more readable code than using contentOffset manually anyway.

However, the reason you're seeing this is that UITableView has not performed its layout pass yet, which happens at the end of the runloop.  It's only there that the new contentSize will be set.  I would be interested if you could test this with a regular UITableView, but I believe right after you call -endUpdates (obviously it has no completionBlock) you will see the same thing!!

The fix would be to force layout (-layoutIfNeeded) on the table view.  We could also implement a test to check that the contentSize is updated in time.  The downside is that this could very well trigger unnecessary layouts and have a performance cost associated.

So here is the problem as I see it with this behavior: because ADK treats moves as delete->insert that means that there is no way to tell in the context of a custom UICollectionViewLayout that this is a move.  When I perform a move op `prepareForCollectionViewUpdates:` is called on my UICollectionViewLayout with an update array with a pair of updates with the action set to .Delete and .Insert.  That means that all context is lost.  So lets say I wanted to do something like this:



Unfortunately because insert/delete is being used this will trigger the wrong animation.  As a general rule it doesn't much matter how ADK operates internally as long as it doesn't leak implementation details through to the UITableView/UICollectionView but I think this would definitely qualify as one of those cases.

We've been rebuilding parts of our app as a feasibility test for using ASDK. So far ASDK has been awesome and we've resolved most of the issues except for one thing. The `moveItem:` animation for ASCollectionNode.

For our app, the `moveItem:` animation is actually quite critical to help inform our users to changes. A simple fade-out-fade-in animation provides a lot less visual cue to the eyes.

- The most important question is, why do you delete all items upon navigating back? I suppose the nodes are automatically cleaned up afterward, no?
- If you have a very good reason to do so, are you sure the index paths are all correct? One way to check this is to switch to -deleteSections and see if the crash still occurs. If it does then it's legitimately a bug in ASDK.
- How do you perform the batch? Do you call any other edit commands in the same batch? If yes then are they sorted properly? (ideally ASCollectionView should sort edit operations the same way UICollectionView does. We are working on this. But even with a sorted list of commands, the index paths still need to be valid)
- Can you share a code snippet, or better yet, a sample project that reproduces the crash?

Although it's hard to debug this kind of problem without a running project, I believe it's not very hard to run into data inconsistency with your old code and the old version of ASDataController. It looks like you're in fact trying to reuse the messages view controller, its collection view and therefore the underlying ASDataController. Coupling that with a (also reused) data source which manages its own (async???) operation queue, and you have a design that is  pretty tricky to get right. I hope you have very good reason(s) for these decisions. Anyway, feel free to report new issues, we are happy to help :)

This direction only supports Flow Layouts, correct?  Any comments to share with the community here on findings re: the difficulty / infeasibility of supporting other types of layouts?  There is some talk at Pinterest of creating a ""floating header"" system that will work with all layouts, and not attempt to integrate with UICollectionViewLayout directly, instead providing more limited / specific functionality to handle the most common use of supplementary views (floating section headers).  This is not a top priority for us right now though, unclear if it would be attempted before the end of the year.

694,2015-10-05 22:44:23,"@levi regarding your earlier post on the architectural consideration — I did a double-take at the new mutable dictionaries, but I think that and the other details of the architecture you spelled out are solid and a reasonable direction for us to take this.  Specifically because the nodes are still stored in inner arrays, not in the dictionary directly, I think the performance cost will be acceptable (storing the nodes directly would have a very measurable impact).

Can you write up some details on what you think would be necessary to enable supplementary nodes without a flow layout?  I say that having not finished reviewing the diff, but I think it is an important question — as we add complexity to these classes, I think it really proves its value if we can get this feature more broadly exposed, while also achieving the secondary goals of supporting further ASDataController customizations.  Even if the non-flow-layout support depended on new delegate methods (or methods that need to be called at certain times by external code), like some kind of invalidation signal, that's probably fine.

@appleguy (re: your message yesterday) I'll find some time tonight to write out a better description of the architecture. To validate the extensibility of this implementation I think we should integrate a custom layout in an example and show how it can be done. Do you have one in mind that would be pretty straight forward?

I suggest we land this sooner rather than later in order to be able to iterate on additional improvements with smaller diffs.

A quick look at the diff gives me the impression that there are just too many changes in ASDataController. That class is very... hot, mainly because it heavily deals with concurrency. Is there any way we can minimize the changes there? 

Not sure if this is a good idea. What I'm having in mind is that ASDataController ~~doesn't~~ shouldn't know about change set at all. Instead, there is a new subclass of ASDataController that intercepts edit calls during a transaction and put them to a change set. Then in endUpdates (of the subclass), it loops through the sorted change set and forward each edit call to its super class-- i.e ASDataController. That way, the new class encapsulates the knowledge about change set and ASDataController remains relatively untouched. What do you think?

693,2015-10-01 02:08:30,"This is really awesome, thanks so much @Adlai-Holler for your large-scale contributions!  I will review in detail this weekend.

Let me start by saying that I'm not afraid of a change that hugely changes ASDataController — obviously it would need to be rigorously tested, but let's face it, the class needs some upgrades.  The critical piece: we must get the architecture RIGHT.  It isn't worth the testing pain of a really big change if we can spot any difficult limitations of its structure that wouldn't be resolvable with later improvements moving in the same direction.

That said, it does seem likely that we could solve this problem with a more surgical change.  I'd buy it that this direction may be BETTER despite the higher initial risk, if we believe it results in code that is easier to debug, read, maintain, extend, or more performant — or any combination of a few of those.

@Adlai-Holler, what's your general philosophy on this?  @levi, @eanagel - interested to hear your thoughts.  Don't worry guys, I won't merge something like this without personally helping to test it heavily with stressful use cases in Pinterest and upgraded thrash testers, and I will also not merge something that breaks any client's app — so let's critique and brainstorm what the ideal architectural approach is before worrying about the risk of any given change.

691,2015-11-11 04:24:37,"@levi has any aspect of this been implemented?  Is this entirely to allow repositioning elements by driving the UICollectionVIewLayout, or are there other benefits?
",appleguy,levi
690,2015-09-28 05:59:17,"@hashemp206 — thanks for asking.  With ASDK, item sizes are typically controlled by the ASDisplayNodes themselves (or ASCellNodes in this case).  There is a .preferredFrameSize property that you can set on certain elements, like ASImageNode, where they may not have a very clear size to calculate for themselves.

I hadn't considered this feature of the collection view layout, and will think about a way to detect and better document it (like printing a log to the console reminding people that layout size is driven by the elements).  There may also be a way to hook this up if the UICollectionView is notified of any changes to itemSize.

Note that one of the advantages of ASTableView and ASCollectionView is that they eliminate one of the two data source methods — cellForRow/Item: and sizeForRow/Item: are collapsed into just nodeForRow/Item:.

Let me know if you have any difficulty here!  Usually creating an ASCellNode subclass is best, and from there you can override either:
- (ASLayoutSpec *)layoutSpecThatFits:(ASSizeRange)constrainedSize;
- (ASLayout *)calculateLayoutThatFits:(ASSizeRange)constrainedSize;

690,2015-09-28 20:28:21,"Thanks for including the gif BTW.  However, it's hard to tell what is going on because there is no content in the cells.  Can you add some subviews to the cells, to help show what is happening?

Also, as with normal UICollectionView / UITableView, the right way to animate their size changing is to call -invalidateCalculatedLayout on the cell (which you can get from nodeForItemAtIndexPath:), and then call reloadRowAtIndexPath: / reloadItemAtIndexPath:.  Check the Kittens app sample (examples/Kittens), but I'm pretty sure it does this (right @nguyenhuy ?).

By doing that, you should be able to have the new values in -calculateSizeThatFits: and it should be taken into account even without calling -setNeedsLayout in your toggle method.  Basically calling toggle could set an instance variable like _height, that is used by the -calculateSizeThatFits method, and also call -invalidateCalculatedLayout.  Then your code that is calling -toggleSize (from the UICollectionView didSelect method) could just call the reloadItem: method.

UICollectionView / UITableView have never been very good about handling resizing items / rows, and sadly AsyncDisplayKit doesn't make it any easier, but it should work (and with very few lines of code) if approached the right way.  The only difference from UIKit is that the size is normally specified from within the node and you need to call -invalidateCalculatedLayout.  The other aspects, including the need to call -reloadItem/Row and to return the new size when UIKit asks for it as a result of calling that method, are the same.
",appleguy,nguyenhuy
690,2015-09-29 14:37:50,"@appleguy Well, actually the Kitten app uses -setNeedsLayout and an empty transaction to achieve size changing. Your way works as well, but it's a bit more complicated because to ASDataController, ""reload"" means destroy the old node and load a new one. So you need to keep track of the selected index path(s) and, in -nodeForRowAtIndexPath, toggle the new node's state. [Here](https://github.com/nguyenhuy/AsyncDisplayKit/commit/2a81ea6fe805f52ac6dbc0cc8b047b3bd4b79516) is a working implementation of this approach. I think this approach is a bit faster if you want to change many cells at the same time, since ASDataController reloads them asynchronously.

@hashemp206 I can't really see which view flickers in your GIF (I haven't seen any smooth GIF animation actually :P).
- If you use -setNeedsLayout, I think you have everything (like the node's view/layer, its old and new sizes, etc) to make a very smooth size transition with Core Animation. For example, [here](https://github.com/nguyenhuy/AsyncDisplayKit/commit/4aa921ecec9e668df9b4b501b1c6b589f2486c72), I use fade in and fade out animations to slowly hide the old size and show the new one. [The result looks quite good](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0elnpyuq1663evo/ASDK-AnimatedKittenNode.mov?dl=0). You can of course animate however you want using the same principle.
- If you use Scott's approach, you can rely on ~~UITableViewCellAnimation~~ UITableViewRowAnimation, like [this](https://github.com/nguyenhuy/AsyncDisplayKit/commit/2a81ea6fe805f52ac6dbc0cc8b047b3bd4b79516#diff-aa81a054912280c7666bbf98546f208eR128).

This is very close to mergable.  In fact, if we could make ASPhotosImageRequest something that most ASDK users would not need to know about (by parsing URLs directly handed to Multiplex), then we shouldn't even worry about the name at this point.

For a more visible API, the ASPhotos prefix sounds possibly ambiguous to me.  I jumped into reading the patch before finishing your intro, and didn't immediately notice that the class was Photos.framework specific, as opposed to a general image downloader.  What do you think about calling it ASPhotosAssetRequest, or ASPhotosFrameworkImageRequest?  If you feel the current name is better, keep it — just some ideas.

For the other classes you mentioned, let's definitely talk!  There are some other folks at Pinterest who would like to discuss image loading and caching, as we are working in similar areas and may be able to share a solution.

687,2015-09-27 18:54:25,"@Adlai-Holler - I am intensely interested in making ASRangeController, and possibly ASDataController, more public-facing.  The Paper app used ""working ranges"" in at least 5 or 6 major areas — the section scroller, the story scroller, vertically within a story for attachments and text, in the back-stack...it is probably the most successful ""new"" UI programming pattern I have seen on the platform in the past couple years.

There are several things standing in the way, though.  1st, a Visible Range is essential for most third party usages.  I want to provide ""visible"" notifications for ASCellNodes in Table / Collection too.

Second, ASDataController is pretty rough, particularly with the batch handling stuff you ran into recently.  I had to change focus before I was able to start testing batches, so I'm embarrassed about its problems there, but they are among the most important in the project right now & fortunately have increasing interest from a couple folks.

Third, I want to make sure we are careful in considering what makes sense for a supportive, powerful third-party API vs something catered to work with UIKit classes.  It may well be the case that there should be a superclass that is public, with UITableView and UICollectionView-specific subclasses that aren't intended to be used directly by third parties.

Thanks for the update on this diff, will check it out!

687,2015-10-01 02:21:30,"@Adlai-Holler great idea, I didn't think of that!  Just make the category nice & visible (probably put it in ASMultiplexImageNode.h, and really explicitly call it out in the comment for the data source method).

I would also just leave out the as_ prefix.  We have used asyncdisplaykit_ for areas where collision is plausible, but that's long for an already-long method name, and I would say there is not a reasonable probability that this full method signature could collide.

Ready to merge as soon as you integrate these changes — thanks for taking the time to discuss, iterate, and get this one really right.
",appleguy,Adlai-Holler
687,2015-10-02 19:58:58,"@appleguy Cool! Glad we dialed it in. I left the ASPhotosFrameworkImageRequest class public in the Details group, but removed reference to it in ASMultiplexImageNode. It's a pretty harmless class and I think users who find it by digging into the Details group will understand that they can use it if they want but we're not supporting it for undocumented use. If that seems too ad-hoc for you I'd be cool walling it off.

I think the code's ready for final review. The last remaining question is the annoying one… Photos framework. I think our two choices are
- Strongly link the Photos framework. Requires us to raise the min deployment target to iOS 8 and increases the memory footprint. 
- Make a subspec that has the Photos integration. Adds complexity to the code and the podspec.

If you're thinking the next release will be 2.0 then the ideal move may be remove support for the Assets Library to offset the memory footprint and replace it with this. Thoughts?
",Adlai-Holler,appleguy
687,2015-10-02 21:58:29,"@Adlai-Holler The next release will indeed be 2.0, which I'm thinking about pushing out this weekend — there are too many people using 1.2.3, and I don't anticipate breaking API changes with the new 2.0 stuff (with the possible exception of the naming of properties in ASStackLayoutable, being evaluated now).

However, 2.0 wasn't planned to drop support for 7.0, so I'm not sure about the implication on dropping AssetsLibrary.  To be honest, I hadn't realized the OSS framework was linking AssetsLibrary in the first place...

Can you please test the latest master to confirm this is fixed?  I'd do that if there were a test project — sure, this is not that hard to build a project for, but look how many tasks there are in ASDK!

After fully understanding the conditions that lead to the other bug, I'm pretty confident this is fixed.  If it's not, it will be a high priority for me as I'm working in ASRangeController.

In the event that it is easy for you to publish the part of the project that reproduces this, please do as it would make for a nice test case for my ongoing development work.  We should probably create a directory (or just keep adding to examples/) for this kind of test project, similar to ASTableViewStressTest, which is primarily intended for ASDK developers.
",appleguy,vitalybaev
684,2015-09-26 21:01:20,"Thanks for engaging on this @smyrgl! As a _user_ of ASDK, there's currently no safe way to do moves intermingled with other changes in a batch update. This is because `ASTableView` immediately applies both the delete and insert for the move, which is unsafe. **This is a pretty major problem.**

For example, say you have 1 section with 7 items `ABCDEFG`. You want to do a batch update with `(move 5 to 1), (insert X at 0)`, so you expect the end result to be `XFABCDEG`.
If you tell ASTableView about the changes in that order you'll end up with `XAFBCDEG` which is wrong. If you tell ASTableView about the changes in reverse order you'll end up with `XEABCDFG`

I may not understand your question about updating your backing store… it's fine to change it all at once just as you always have. If your backing data store is a 2D array, then you need to apply these changes in the correct order just like ASTableView/ASCollectionView to avoid errors. If that's not really what you're getting at, let me know!

EDIT: Here's an operation I'm using in a production app to apply updates from an NSFetchedResultsController to an ASTableView/ASCollectionView. It's a little hairy since it's from production but hopefully it'll help https://gist.github.com/Adlai-Holler/a67f7a96779952ed5062
",Adlai-Holler,smyrgl
684,2015-09-27 00:11:58,"@Adlai-Holler Thanks for the gist...I'll try applying it.  What I mean by the backing store is whatever the Table/Collection view is using as its datasource.  The reason I mentioned changing the store during the batch operation is that right now I noticed that `ASTableView` is that if you (for example) tell ASTableView to do an insert operation after calling `beginUpdates()` it actually does the insert operation and rebuilds the cell node immediately and calls lock/unlock to the datasource to ensure consistency.  What I gather from this is that the intent of the`ASTableView` datasource protocol is that it wants the data updated as you go through the batch updates--it is not like the UITableViewDataSource protocol that expects all of the data to be updated ahead of time while the batch updates are the formula to rationalize between the old and new state of the table view.  Because the datasource is being queried DURING the batch process I'm not sure how this could work unless the `ASTableViewDataSource` is also being updated incrementally.  Please feel free to correct me if you think I'm misunderstanding any of this.

@nguyenhuy I think you are right about the issues, the danger here is that because `ASTableView` mimics the `UITableView` API as closely as possible it can downright confuse people what's going on.  If you don't think you guys are going to deal with changes the way `UITableView` does I can understand that but it probably would be a good idea to add some documentation around exactly how the `ASTableViewDataSource` needs to behave and what the right way of handling these change operations are.  I assume (please correct me if I'm wrong) that the way you expect users to use this API is something like this:

1) Receive change list.
2) Call `beginUpdates()`
3) Enumerate through the change list, for each item dispatch a block operation to a serial operation queue which will make the change to whatever is acting as the ASTableViewDataSource and to tell the table view to insert/delete/move/update the row section associated with that block.  The calls to lock/unlock dataSource on the ASTableViewDataSource will suspend this queue.
4) Once all of the changes have been processed called `endUpdates()`.

Do I have that right?

684,2015-09-27 21:00:59,"@smyrgl I think we want to mimic UITableView and UICollectionView behaviours, if not directly in ASDataController then in a wrapper/subclass of it that can be used by ASTableView and ASCollectionView. It will be easier for new developers to switch to ASDK.

@Adlai-Holler Thanks for taking the second issue. Let me elaborate my words:
- The current behaviour is somewhat broken, but people have came up with many creative workarounds. I'm just wondering if we apply the fix directly to ASDataController, those workarounds may no longer work and it would be quite painful if they happen to be in production code. Also, IIRC, @appleguy planned to use ASDataController for other classes as well. So changing that class to work with UITableView/UICollectionView may not be ideal.
- What I'm thinking is that we can do the sorting as an extension on top of ASDataController, like a subclass or a wrapper. Such extension will only be used by UITableView/UICollectionView. It actually sits between UITableView/UICollectionView and ASDataController. 
- After that, we can allow a way for developers to opt-in for that extension and test it. For example, we can add a new flag to ASTableView/ASCollectionView initializers. Such flag can be used by a new table/collection view to determine whether it should create an ASDataController or the extension. ASDataController will be used by default, so there will be no breaking API changes and existing workarounds will still work.
- Once we are confident that the extension works correctly, we can use it as the default option.

My app is actually a really good case for testing this because I use table view sections to represent root nodes in a flattened infinite depth tree data structure that is stored in Core Data and listened to by an `NSFetchedResultsController` (which as noted above does not produce ordered changes).  I have live updates going on (via web socket listeners which fire Core Data change events), batch fetching (for infinite scroll), manual collapse/expand of nodes (which takes the form of delete/inserts) and manual sort control (which generates a metric ton of section/row move operations).

You should definitely uncheck the ""collapse stacks"" thing in the Xcode side window...there are a few stack frames that I really want to see to better understand this, but appear lost forever :).

Thanks again for the report, hope to fully understand this one as soon as we see it again and collect more details.  Pinterest's work is just now generating large new implementations based on ASDK (the first screen of which is now in a public experiment), so in a few months we will have a better sense of even the rarest crashes.

One reason I'm so interested in this is that I haven't seen an ASDK crash outside of the Table / Collection classes for a very, very long time.  It needs to be structurally impossible for this framework to crash, and so I want to follow up on any examples otherwise.  I think there are still some rare cases where Table / Collection can crash, so implementing better thrash tests that expose any issues is high on my list.

I think duplicating an example is a fine starter approach for most sample projects, although it may be the case that with Carthage, starting from clean build settings (rather than a project / workspace originally managed by Cocoapods) is the better idea?

675,2015-09-22 21:10:55,"@appleguy if there are already people with some ideas in mind, great! I'd love to hear their inputs :) If not, I'd be more than happy to make the example project with the bare minimum to trigger an error if there are files missing.  

I agree that starting with a clean project would be a good idea, though the README sounds a bit like all projects in the examples folder get ""pod install"" for CI, which obviously would error out for a carthage project. Is it safe to just create a new project that doesn't depend on cocoapods?

672,2015-09-20 06:25:15,"@eanagel Thanks! It would indeed make this a 1-line commit, assuming that `reloadData` -> `setNeedsLayout` which I'd bet it does. The performance cost comes from laying out the cells when they don't necessarily need to be laid out. For a simple example, consider if you called `reloadData` 5 times during the same frame. The collection view cells would get laid out 5 times for one frame.

As for ASTableView, I don't _think_ it behaves the same way but I'll check it tomorrow and post back on this thread either way.

A few questions / escalation steps to reach a resolution:
- Were there any changes after updating to master, either in the specifics of the stack trace, or frequency of the crash?
- Describe a bit more about what types of edit operations your app does.  Does it use batch updating at all, or never?  Have you found a way to reproduce this 100%?  Assuming not, have you noticed any patterns that make it more likely?  (fast scrolling, running on a device rather than simulator, using scroll-to-top, leaving and revisiting the view, suspending / resuming the app, etc)
- Share more of your implementation so we can understand the calls going into the framework and can look for causes.  This may not be feasible for you, but one option would be taking the relevant files and hacking out the majority of them, leaving empty cell nodes that you are pushing around.
- Create a test project, either via the above mechanism or from modifying one of the ASCollectionView example projects.  This would allow us to fix the issue most quickly by far, as we can both live debug and validate the fix (it may actually not be possible to figure out the issue without doing this)

Although we should be able to fix the issue, keep in mind that the best way to embed a collection view inside an ASTableView would be to use the ASCollectionNode that I just landed today.  For now, you must access the view property to configure the asyncDelegate, asyncDataSource, on the underlying ASCollectionView (and thus, must do this on the main thread).  I'm thinking about the right way to improve this API, and am interested in any suggestions you may have (no worries though, I have a plan developing).

The reason to use ASCollectionNode is that it enables much more refined preloading behavior.  The nested ASCollectionNode's own working range will coordinate with the containing ASTableView's working range, carefully managing network preload and display / rendering to minimize both memory usage and user-perceived wait time.

As of today, there isn't a ""header node"" class for ASTableView, and I think it is best not to add one if you can achieve the desired behavior by using a cell instead.  If you need ""floating header"" behavior and it is not relatively straightforward to implement with an overlaid view + -scrollViewDidScroll:, then I would be happy to merge a patch that supports using nodes for headers / footers (optionally, with views still supported).

622,2015-08-22 00:22:03,"@rcancro yes, I think you would have to do that.  Let me start by saying that this feels like a confusion that clients are going to experience, so we should think about simplifying the API if at all possible.  I think we may deprecate -calculateSizeThatFits: entirely, although I would like to leave support for it in the framework for quite a while because it used to be the only way (and there is a lot of production code at some pretty big companies that depends on it).

So looking at just -calculateLayout... and -layoutSpec..., the -calculate version basically bypasses ASLayoutSpec entirely.  The ASLayoutSpec version just provides a middleman to handle the calculation step later.

For your use case, although I'm not totally sure if I understand:
- The text node wouldn't have any subnodes, meaning that ASLayoutSpec as an abstraction is presumably useless; the only thing being calculated is our own size, with no children.  The power / utility of ASLayoutSpec is in its ability to calculate not only the self size, but both size and position of children.
- If your subclass used ASLayoutSpec, then the framework has two incompatible things to call calculate on: the superclasses' direct implementation, as well as the ASLayoutSpec itself.  This is probably not what you wanted as the ASLayoutSpec you provide probably can't even accurately calculate the text's size.
- If your subclass used the -calculate method directly, it would be able to call the super implementation very naturally and then modify its return value.  This would remove the ambiguity at the framework level as well.
",appleguy,rcancro
622,2015-08-22 04:23:46,"@appleguy That description makes a lot of sense -- thank you! I think a lot of confusion would be solved if `layoutSpecThatFits:` had a name more like `layoutSpecThatFitsSubnodes:` or `layoutSpecForSubnodes:` or just `layoutSubnodes:`. Just as I wouldn't try to do anything in UIView's `layoutSubviews` if I had no subviews, I'd know that I don't have any business making a layout spec if I didn't have any subnodes.

We could also steal the autolayout terminology and instead of `calculateLayoutThatFits:` name it something like `calculateIntrinsicContentSize:` or `calculateLayoutForIntrinsicContentSize:`. That would alert me to the fact that this is for a node with no subnodes and this is how it gets its size. But I'm also used to working in autolayout, so that may be why this name makes sense to me.

622,2015-08-22 15:05:49,"Thanks for your explanation, @appleguy. It describes what I had in mind (and many more), with way better language. Definitely something I can learn from.

@rcancro: yes, -calculateLayoutThatFits is what you need to override. But thinking again, if your custom node already overrides -calculateSizeThatFits, you don't gain any advantage here. However, I hope you don't abandon this PR, because it is exactly what we have to do to drop support for -calculateSizeThatFits. If we do this now, there will be 1 less breaking change for ASTextNode subclasses (including yours) in the future.

I've been playing around with a custom text node that has built-in insets. My current implementation looks like this:



My text node has correct size, but its text is rendered incorrectly because I haven't figured out the way to command its text renderer to draw within a (smaller) rendering bounds.

And I agree that we need better names. I'm pretty bad at naming things anyway, so it's you call :)

622,2015-08-22 17:34:46,"@appleguy and I spoke at this once, and we ultimately decided that a view probably shouldn't be adding its own padding. Even classes like `UIButton` that have `contentEdgeInsets` property are (I assume) adding this padding to a subview.

Ultimately, when I add a text node to a spec I can just wrap it in an `ASInsetLayoutSpec` to get the behavior I want. I'm just looking for a way for this to happen automatically as I know that people won't remember to do it. 

I've thought about adding an optional method to `ASLayoutable` like `willBeAddedToLayoutSpec` that returns an `id<ASLayoutable>` that would allow a child to wrap itself. 

I've also thought about adding a new protocol with this method that a child can conform to. When adding the child, a spec can call this method if the child implements the protocol.

This is all separate from this PR which is about moving ASTextNode to `calculateLayoutThatFits`. So if we can agree on names then we can still merge this. :)
",rcancro,appleguy
622,2015-08-23 18:43:47,"@rcancro the idea to provide an auto-wrapping layout spec is pretty interesting.  The fact that ASDisplayNode conforms to ASLayoutable actually breaks this a bit, though.  Imagine for a moment that ASDisplayNode itself could not be added as a child of an ASLayoutSpec, and you /had/ to access a spec.  Then we'd have standard -[ASDisplayNode layoutSpec] method, or something similar, to allow adding individual nodes to the layout tree.  This would potentially serve as an override point to introduce automatic insets and such.  One riff on this would be an -[ASDisplayNode layoutable] method, but if this just returned self, clients could still add display nodes directly and then defeat the override point.

This would be a fairly big change.  It elegantly handles the case we desire, but does add boilerplate and one additional level of understanding required to use layout specs at all (since you wouldn't be able to directly add nodes to specs).  It also makes it a little harder to understand layout specs in general, because in addition to handling layout-manipulating tasks, they would now also have to handle representing an individual node (with no other purpose than standing in for a single node).

Very much in the spirit of ASDK, there might be a fancy way to make this work seamlessly.  What if when you added an ASDisplayNode directly, we had a mechanism built into ASLayoutSpecs to check for a method that provides an optional wrapping ASLayoutSpec?  This seems tricky to get right, as it would be critical that the layout spec returned does contain the node in question, or the user behavior observed would be wildly confusing.

Lastly: I agree we can still land this.  -calculateSizeThatFits: has to move towards deprecation or our API surface area is just too large in this space.  Although ASLayoutSpecs should probably only be used for nodes with children, that is NOT true for ASLayout, as returned by -calculateLayout...  ASLayout specifies self's size, and optionally, any children's position /and/ size.  Every node should have a mechanism of creating an ASLayout, and there are exactly two places they can come from: -calculateLayout called on an ASLayoutSpec, or -calculateLayout called directly on the node.

619,2015-09-01 18:43:11,"I've run into similar issues as @eanagel when attempting to call `nodeForRowAtIndexPath`. This call is the number one crash report I'm getting in my app. 

My usecase for using `didEndDisplayingNodeForIndexPath` was to fade out a specific area within a CellNode when no longer on screen and then fade it back in when it displays again. I was able to fix this by overriding `clearContents` on the cell node and handling the logic there. For me this feels like a cleaner solution than using `didEndDisplayingNodeForIndexPath` and haven't run into any issues with it.

However, I do have another case where data related to the tableview (but not required for rendering the tableview) is fetched in the background. Once that data is fetched I attempt to loop over the current rows and update the rows if needed. Here the call to `nodeForRowAtIndexPath` is causing a large number of crash reports.

Id vote for adding a new api of `nodeForRowAtIndexPath:withCompletion` where if no node exists for the given indexPath it returns nil / NSError and does not throw an exception.

611,2015-08-19 02:11:24,"Hey guys,

I just copied the BaselineFirst/BaselineLast idea from UIStackView. For anything but text nodes it seems pretty worthless to me (imagine an image node that has its top aligned with the baseline of a text node) but I wasn't sure that was a good enough reason to not include it. I'm not married to ascender/descender, and can give it a shot with `distanceToBasline` or something similar.

To tell you the truth, for what I need the layout to do, a layoutInsets would be the most helpful. I  actually have another branch where I'd already started working on that idea. ASInsetSpec didn't work for me because I wanted text node subclasses (it is a long, long story), but couldn't return an inset layout spec because a subclass can only implement 1 of the 3 layout methods (is that something we can change?). So I would still be in favor of layoutInsets in ASLayoutable.

But I'm not sure that one needs to replace the other, and contend that both are useful. First of all, if I were looking for a way to align stack children to a baseline I would not immediately think to use layout insets. Secondly, the baseline may not be where you'd want to measure vertical spacing. Finally, I've already implemented ASCenterLayout and ASInsetLayout to honor the layoutInsets so it could be something that is valid for more than just a stack spec (where as baseline would not be).

I agree with @appleguy that we don't want to scare people off by making ASLayoutable too large, but I also think that once people start using stack specs the extra options will be appreciated. So perhaps making an ASStackLayoutable protocol to separate all these options is the right solution. Would we end up changing all classes that implement ASLayoutable then implement ASStackLayoutable? Unless there is an obvious layout spec that should never be a child of a stack layout?

Let me know and I'll give these changes a go and get an updated PR up soon! Thanks for the input!!

It would be an easy thing to fix, particularly for a nil string (even a @"""" empty string might be more plausibly nonzero height, but that's harder to decide!)  Could you run a quick test with UILabel and see what its sizeToFit does with a nil string, with an explicit font set?  I assume it is 0, 0.

Feel free to submit a diff to check for a zero-length string (which would catch nil, too) in the size/layout methods of ASTextNode.  If you don't have a chance to do this, that's fine; I'll make sure it gets into an upcoming release.

600,2015-08-09 02:09:41,"@nannanIT thanks for filing an issue — I'd love to help.

1) This sounds like an annoying issue, and should be fixable.  Could you try enabling the new 1.2.3 (or master) property of ASTableView that preserves the content offset?  ""automaticallyAdjustsContentOffset""  I haven't tried this with a total reload, as it's meant for insert / remove / move calls.

2) Please share more information about what you're seeing.  Is the memory growing continuously and never being lowered?  Or is it just a higher baseline?  Note that with the default values for rangeTuningParameters, it is expected that ASTableView will consume more memory; it is ""rendering ahead"" offscreen cells so that when they come onscreen, they do not show placeholders and also don't cause stuttering like UITableView.  Please feel free to adjust rangeTuningParameters (particularly for the ASLayoutRangeTypeRender) to a smaller value to save memory.

If you're seeing memory rise without coming down / stabilizing, this could be a bug.  Like in any app there is some overhead where the memory will continue to rise as you load more and more content, but it should level off after the working range is full.  In particular, CG raster data should tend to stabilize, even though other objects (like the ASDisplayNodes themselves and their corresponding UIViews, CALayers, etc) will continue to grow.  Those objects are not very large without the backing store though.

If you're able to provide a test case that demonstrates any of these issues, it will help me and the other active maintainers diagnose and resolve it as quickly as possible.  Thanks for trying out the framework!

In short, yes, reloadData discards everything and load new nodes, without reusing. But hold on, let me explain and show you some alternatives.

Besides reload, we have introduced ""relayout"". A relayout means there are changes in the layout of one or more nodes, let's keep those nodes and update their layouts. Relayout is done on main thread, but it's ok due to its infrequent usage. 

Whenever you want to do a ""reload"", you actually want to do 1 of the following things:
- Update layout of a specific node: Caused by a change in the node itself while its constrained size is unchanged. For example, its data changed or user taps it. You can easily trigger a relayout on the node by simply calling -setNeedsLayout. If the relayout results in a different size, an empty batch editing transaction must be triggered to animate to new sizes. Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/examples/Kittens/Sample/KittenNode.mm#L193) and [here](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/examples/Kittens/Sample/ViewController.m#L117).
- Update layout of all nodes: Caused by different constrained size for each and every node, for example after orientation change or a table view entering editing mode. ASDK can handle these cases automatically. The API (-relayoutAllRows) is private for now, but after #599, I think it's a good idea to make it public.
- Reload one or some nodes: Caused by total invalidation of the nodes, for example you want to show a completely new UI. This can be done via -reloadSections, -reloadRowsAtIndexPath or -reloadItemsAtIndexPath.
- Reload data (a.k.a reload everything!): Caused by any other reasons and you absolutely need to destroy existing nodes and create new ones.

UIKit's reloadData is relatively cheap and we tend to overuse it -- reloadData all the time! But ASDK's version is substantially more expensive. So when we are about to call reloadData, we should ask ourselves: Do I really need it? Most of the time, instead of reloadData, what you actually need is insert, delete, move, relayout or maybe a combination of them. reloadData is the last resort :)

- Leave out the Cocoapod version update.  We had some chronic build failures with version 38, which also broke the internal Pinterest build system.  We're going to wait a while before updating it.
- Thoughts on overriding -setNeedsDisplay on ASTextNode to do the block helper method, rather than wrapping each call to it?  The downside I see here is that it changes the semantics of another class calling -setNeedsDisplay, which could be pretty bad.

I agree with @appleguy that, in many cases, this new property is not only very useful for network image nodes but also for display nodes. flexBasis and other properties are declared in `ASLayoutable.h` which is conformed by both ASDisplayNode and layout specs. If I understand ""next to the flexBassis and other properties"" correctly, I think we should **not** push it down to `ASLayoutable.h`. Because the main, if not the only, reason for the existence of each layout spec is that the spec can measure its sized based on its unique layout logic and its children. So layout specs should not have a predefined size. We should push this down to ASDisplayNode, but **no** further.

Also, since calculated size must be within the given constrained size range, I think there are ~~2 things~~ 1 thing we must consider:
- Name this new property according to this rule. To me, ""expected"" implies too much certainty. Perhaps ""default"", ""suggested"" and ""proposed"" are better?

590,2015-08-07 08:46:39,"I also prefer ""preferredFrameSize"" :)

@rcancro Sorry for misunderstanding your idea. Here is my 2 cents on the drawbacks of an ASStackNode:
1. It has all the unnecessary properties of ASDisplayNode, most noticeably the backing view or layer.
2. Instead of constructing an ASStack**LayoutSpec**, the root node now has an ASStackNode subnode, which in turn holds some subnodes. For example, KittenNode node has an ASStackNode that has an image and a text node. So, 1 more level added to the node tree (and probably the calculated ASLayout tree).
3. I'm not really sure, but I think the root node still has to be a custom node to correctly describes its layout.
4. Due to above reasons, it would be hard (at least for me) to figure out how to correctly construct the nodes. I mean I want image and text nodes to be stacked horizontally within the KittenNode, but I can't add them directly to KittenNode. Instead, I have to add those nodes to an ASStackNode, then add that stack node to KittenNode. Then, I have to set correct stack properties to the stack node (although they actually describe how those subnodes should be laid out within KittenNode). Oh, and need to override layout method(s) of KittenNode.
5. I think writing layout specs is not that difficult, although it can be because I'm pretty familiar with it.

Anyway, I admit that I might have a bit bias against the idea of having layout ASDisplayNodes - display nodes that are purely responsible for layout. So, another pair of eyes is very helpful :) And code talks, so if you have the full implementation of ASStackNode with sample usage(s), I would love to read!

You can accomplish that pretty easily, although it may not be exactly what you want.  Use the node initializer -initWithViewBlock: and you can create your standard view header in-place.

This might actually work with -[ASCellNode initWithViewBlock:] directly, although I'm not confident on that.  ASCellNode definitely doesn't support layer-backing (so you couldn't use -initWithLayerBlock:), but it should probably work with the view version.  If it doesn't, it should be trivial to create an ASCellNode subclass.

If you do have to create the ASCellNode subclass, then you can get away without wrapping the views at all.  In that case, simply allocate them in the -didLoad method of the ASCellNode subclass, and add them as a subview of self.view.  Make sure to lay them out in the -layout method (called in the same situation as -layoutSubviews), probably just setting the containing view's frame to self.view.bounds.

I am going to be focusing some time on ASDK this weekend and will think more carefully about this in the next two days.  I'm certainly in favor of a simplified API, so in some sense believe we should rely on begin/endUpdates wrapping these calls whenever the developer needs the callback.  On the other hand, having the callback is one way to remind developers of the mental model of using ASTableView and ASCollectionView—the edit changes may not show up onscreen synchronously, e.g. the user could scroll around a bit instead of their interaction being blocked until the edit is processed.  Even for developers who pass NULL for the block, perhaps in some cases that reminder would be useful...

574,2015-07-18 21:15:20,"@tuantavan thanks for reporting this.  I read your report a few times, but am not completely certain the scenario / symptoms you are describing.  Would you be able to try describing it again, perhaps including 2 or 3 screenshots (or much better yet — a screen capture video, which QuickTime X can do for free with the simulator)?

We are currently working on this area, as you can see with the open pull request from @eanagel there is some work to build in better support for adjusting scroll position when changing the data source.  You may need to use the endUpdatesAnimated:completion: method he added.  The completion is necessary for your case, because even after you do an insert or a reload, there is a short asynchronous delay before you can do the scrolling command; otherwise the cell will not have been asynchronously sized and added to the table.  This is very likely at the root of your issue.

I'll work hard to make sure that what you would like to do is as easy as possible, if you're able to provide more descriptive detail.  Of course, a test case that allows reproducing the problem in isolation is the best way to get this fixed quickly.

One side tip: messaging apps often find it useful to flip the table / collection view upside down (transform the entire thing), and then flip each of the cells upside down (also transform them) so the content still shows right-side-up.  What this accomplishes is more efficient loading and an easier time staying at the ""bottom"" / most current messages (assuming they get added at the bottom as new messages come in, and you usually want the focus to stay there).  I'm not totally sure, but I think this is how @nguyenhuy 's project (AsyncMessagesViewController — ASDK based messaging) is implemented.
",appleguy,tuantavan
574,2015-07-20 00:36:29,"@appleguy The issue is ASCollectionView won't keep its scroll position after calling reloadItemsAtIndexPaths to reload the last item (no layout changed). It will scroll back to the item before the last one.

I guess the problem is caused by the current implementation: reloading nodes by deleting nodes then re-adding nodes.

571,2015-12-19 04:04:27,"Hmm, this is a good bug.  We just fixed some attribute handling in ASTextNode, but if I'm understanding the test project correctly, this one is still not fixed.  Sorry about that guys — I'm not sure what's going on yet, especially since Paper and Instant Articles both clearly use non-default link colors and most certainly uses ASTextNode.

@mmiedlarz just want to say again how much I appreciate you uploading the test project.  It is very helpful to getting something like this fixed.  I'm sorry there's been a long delay on this, but as you can see there has been a lot of activity on the project with really big efforts, like adopting a big update to the text rendering engine and important internal capabilities like .interfaceState and .hierarchyState.  We are now starting to get to issues like this.

@samhsiung - I don't expect you to spend a lot of time looking at this, but since you recently figured out some really quite tricky issues with ASTextNode and attribute handling, do you think this bug might stand out to you?  There is definitely special handling of NSLinkAttributeName in the code, and that's probably to blame, considering that removing that attribute from the sample code provided causes the color to come through correctly.

571,2015-12-19 12:55:31,"@appleguy I updated TestProject to 1.9.3, and issue still existed. But I found, that if you use custom link attributes in NSAttributedString and ASTextNode, everything works fine (I changed in demo project too).

570,2015-07-18 21:08:05,"@coenert, the two classes you mentioned have never been tested with usages outside of ASTableView and ASCollectionView.  It's one reason they are in the Details folder and not documented as primary API integration points.  That said, I would love to help fix any bugs in this area and make them more usable by other classes, as they are designed to be able to do this.

Would you be able to share sample code reproducing the issue?  There are many factors in your implementation that could cause this.  It may well be an ASDK framework bug, or it could be a bug with your integration.

Check if the -clearContents method is being called on ASImageNode.  If it's not, then this will happen.  ASRangeHandlerRender is intended to call this and you'll notice it get called for anything in an ASCollectionView or ASTableView.

Thanks for using the framework; glad to have you as a member of the community!  Pinterest and a few other clients are starting to look at custom integrations with these two classes, but it is fairly cutting edge work, and we're happy to have someone else interested in doing that too :).

570,2015-10-24 04:09:03,"@coenert  - I'm very sorry you encountered this issue.  It turns out there is a bug with ASBasicImageDownloader, although it's hard to be certain if that is exactly what you're seeing here.  My hope was that few people would use this class, because there is a lot of value for an app to more closely control its use of the network (that's why the cache and downloader properties exist with a protocol that you can adopt for ASNetworkImageNode and ASMultiplexImageNode).  Still, it is a very serious issue to leak memory and so I apologize for this problem.

If you are able to provide any additional data here, especially if you can test your case against the fix we come up with for this retain cycle, I would greatly appreciate you opening a new task.

The placeholder fade-out feature was added by @rnystrom a while back, and hasn't gotten a lot of usage / testing yet.  That's not a good reason for it to have bugs, but suffice it to say that there are a few cool ways we could improve both the API and the implementation.

Right now I'm working on the display system, which is closely related to how placeholders are shown and removed.  Because it is still possible for a client to implement their own placeholder mechanics, I will have to prioritize this after the other display work, but it may well be possible to fix at the same time.

Last thing: please add some mechanism to alert developers accessing the text view before it is initialized.  I think this would be sufficient: ASDisplayNodeAssert(_textField != nil, @""ASEditableTextNode's text field has not been allocated yet — access it in -didLoad or after accessing the .view property instead"")

Since we now have the main thread assertion (very important), an even better solution would probably be to force creation of the view and text field at the access time of the property if it hasn't been created.  This would make the API more convenient to use where the editable node is being directly hosted, and in the case of a regular node hierarchy, if initialization is being performed off-main then the assertion would catch it.

541,2015-07-08 20:00:08,"@grigaci there are a couple small issues being found with the box model layout support, so I'm thinking we should wait until about mid next-week for the developers using master to try out the new features and flag / fix any big problems.  Then we can push out ASDK 2.0 Beta 1.  However, it's not all that important to have a ""Beta"" release as opposed to just using master; one of the main reasons is as an opportunity to post about the features an goals of 2.0 in discussion forums, and get more people looking at it.  Since you already know, feel free to continue using master to benefit from the latest fixes and we should have more folks joining us next week when the announcement happens.
",appleguy,grigaci
540,2015-07-07 17:23:39,"@ryanfitz thanks for the issue; I think it may be a duplicate, but I'll leave it open until I confirm.  In any case, this is actually expected behavior for the current implementation.  It's certainly an area that could be improved, but there's an important factor that make it less critical to change: AsyncDisplayKit is particularly useful for apps with variable row heights (a major indication that the content reaches a higher level of complexity where layout and rendering should really be asynchronous).  For those apps, before ASDK, UIKit would ask for the row / item heights for all items in the datasource anyway, and so they are likely already expecting to require a system that stages in the data so that this blocking doesn't happen all at once.

For the apps that previously did synchronous text layout for everything up-front, synchronously creating the cell nodes is typically less CPU time, as the layout then occurs asynchronously after that.

The use case that this really hurts are for /fixed-height/ tables with large local databases.  This sounds like the case you have?  I genuinely care about making sure the framework handles this elegantly, and it is absolutely possible with some additional effort.

Feel free to pass on any there details about your use case and workarounds you might try.  How tough would it be to stage in the data source by using the batch loading callbacks?  (check out where ASBatchContext is used).  The reason this is tricky is that we still need to trigger data fetching & rendering callbacks before cells come onscreen, even in the case that they are all the same height, and ASRangeController / ASDataController would need changes to be able to handle doing this while limiting cell allocation.

Other tasks may refer to this concept as the ""allocation range"".
",appleguy,ryanfitz
540,2015-07-07 20:16:00,"@appleguy thanks for the helpful info. The current implementation makes sense. My use case involves rows that can vary greatly in height, so ASDK is a huge improvement in handling different sized rows compared to to UIKits. I imagine its loading all nodes on background threads, calculating sizes and then loads the data into the backing ui table / collection view so it can do as little on the main thread as possible.

For some more info on my use case, I have different sized rows with complex cells that have lots of data and most importantly contains several unique images per row. As a user scrolls down the screen, more data is loaded off the network and then rows are getting inserted / removed / moved (not doing full reloads). 

I'm running into a two different memory related crashes. As a user moves around the app, images are getting downloaded off the network (using `ASMultiplexImageNode` and `ASNetworkImageNode`) and then stored as UIImage's. As a user scrolls away from these cells the images are still in memory, as the tope level `ASCellNodes` are not being deallocated. I eventually get a crash because of too much memory usage. The second issue is very similar, but is triggered when the next page of data is loaded off the network. As a user scrolls, I fetch the next 25 items of data and then insert these 25 rows into the tableview. What happens is even if current memory usage is very low, these 25 rows are getting loaded all at once, memory usage spikes and apple force closes the app because of a large spike in memory usage.

I believe I can work around these issues with a smarter implementation of my `ASCellNode`. I wanted to make sure that the current implementation of loading all cells into memory was expected, before I started diving into improving my cell nodes. 

I'll leave this issue open, but feel free to close it out. Thanks again for all the help

540,2015-07-08 06:25:50,"@appleguy I can create another issue for this, but I'm seeing `ASDisplayNodes` are getting retained indefinitely once measure is called on a node. I've been able to replicate this in both objective-c and swift. You can replicate it by allocating an `ASDisplayNode` call measure on it and then nil out the node. Dealloc will never be called.

You might also look to modify the .rangeTuningParameters for your use case, particularly for an image-heavy app running on older devices (a smaller render range could be important for the low-memory devices, although this increases the risk of seeing placeholders).  In particular you might want to cut down on the ""trailing"" range so things are deallocated more quickly.  Take a look at how ASRangeHandlerRender is implemented / used to understand this bit and please let me know right away if it's not working correctly for you, as this would be one of the issues I'd prioritize for this coming weekend.

The main advantage I can see from using something like RAC, would be a more declarative API, that could be indeed interesting. I had this idea for a while, and was [implemented successfully by others](http://blog.scottlogic.com/2014/05/11/reactivecocoa-tableview-binding.html), would be a declarative way of implementing an `UITableView`'s dataSource delegate methods.

536,2015-07-05 19:46:57,"@tiepvuvan thanks for reporting this.  It turns out this is intentionally not done automatically, because relayout passes can be expensive, and are often not what the app developer wants (it is common for re-layouts to occur but result in the same positioning of elements, which can be hard to detect without careful profiling).

To deal with this situation, you should be able to call -invalidateCalculatedSize (if you start using the AsyncDisplayKit 2.0 Beta coming out soon, it is -invalidateLayout).  Then you can call -measure: and -layoutIfNeeded in succession.  One of the easier ways to do this is probably calling -reloadData on the table view.

This is a use case that a number of community members are interested in seeing better support for, so you're not alone!  In particular, PR #468 lays the groundwork for this and I would like to see transparent support for relayouts be part of AsyncDisplayKit 2.0.  Although the Beta is coming very soon (it may make it for today!), the final version may take until late August / shortly before my talk at NSSpain.

",appleguy,SRandazzo
529,2015-06-29 22:38:59,"@nguyenhuy thanks for your thoughts — helpful!

Indeed this amounts to a first pass architectural improvement for the ASDataController aimed at 100% correctness first, even in the most extreme circumstances, with optimization scaling in later.

The visible-range-aware prioritization would be great; indeed we could adjust the size of the layoutGroups depending on, say, the size of the render range rather than a number determined only by a multiple of the CPU core count.

We should also implement the ability to not lay out all nodes in the data source, and notify UIKit (underlying UITableView / UICollectionView / even the ASRangeController) only of a subset of the total nodes in the asyncDataSource.  This would significantly reduce the number of nodes that are created and sized if an app has a fairly large local data source with hundreds of rows.  In a way, this would be like an ""allocation + layout range"" — similar in principle to the Render and Preload ranges.  However, it is conceptually different in that a node should not be available to enter any other ASRangeHandler until it has gotten past the allocation + layout step.  After thinking about this for a while I'm convinced that keeping this functionality in ASDataController is the right thing, not extending ASRangeController.  It is however possible that we would want to use or extend the idea of an ASRangeHandler, or even abstract parts of ASRangeController, for ASDataController to drive its decision and processing of which nodes to allocate and lay out.

I think there's a lot of impact to be had pursuing these increasingly sophisticated takes on ASDataController, and they are probably in the top 3 ""major projects"" that should be undertaken in the next 6 months for ASDK.

513,2015-06-26 20:14:04,"Ah, this is very interesting — I appreciate the investigation @jflinter .  I'd like to merge this and very much support the general direction, but have a couple concerns:
- Have you carefully considered what will happen for layer-backed or subtree-precomposited (rasterized) nodes?
- Can you think of a way we could evaluate the performance overhead of returning non-default values for the first responder properties?  It is a vague concern right now, but I worry that this could somehow increase the substantial UIKit overhead that is seen with -addSubview: and -removeFromSuperview as those operations scan the hierarchy to update the first responder.

Could you share one or two use cases that you've run into for these features?  I think we should also include at least a couple unit tests for this kind of functionality, to make sure it behaves in a consistent way with layer-backing, pre compositing, and the desired behavior itself.

I think there was some discussion in #449 which led to the target and/or product to being renamed part way through.

502,2015-06-23 17:39:18,"@samw723 this is an interesting case to consider.  However, I think it could be important that the reference is retained.  What if a user creates an ASBasicImageDownloader and passes it in as the downloader, but then releases the object?  How would it stay alive for the node's usage?
",appleguy,samw723
502,2015-06-24 03:15:35,"@appleguy I understand and can resolve it by using another ASImageDownloaderProtocol implementation rather than using class itself. 

I found this problem when I try to create a ASCellNode which contains multiplex image display, and the ASImageDownloaderProtocol implemented on cell node, then cell node cannot be released due to strong reference loop.

It makes developers confuse since your sample project ""Multiplex"" using
_imageNode = [[ASMultiplexImageNode alloc] initWithCache:nil downloader:self];

and this situation will happen on Objective-C ARC mode or in Swift.
",samw723,appleguy
502,2015-07-05 19:17:09,"@samw723 looking at this again now.  Thanks for raising this issue to my attention; I am equally concerned about the ease of use of the framework for developers who are not as sophisticated as yourself, and may not realize the existence of this issue and the need for a ""workaround"".

Do you have any specific suggestions how we could resolve this and achieve correctness in both cases?  E.g., there are certainly cases where it retaining the downloader is required (I would say, this is probably most cases, particularly because ASBasicImageDownloader is provided for the ""out of the box"" usage) — but then there is this case where a retain cycle can be set up if you implement the downloader protocol on the object that owns the image node.  I'm not entirely sure there is a clean solution to this, but hopefully I'm missing something.

Not that I doubted you specifically, just that it is surprising to me that there is any way in which the CA cornerRadius property could be overridden...particularly because I tried directly setting it on the layer too, eliminating a problem with the property bridge.

What I said earlier is still true — cornerRadius is a disastrously expensive property that should only be used when there is no alternative.  Fully redrawing the image to clip the corners is actually much faster because it happens once, rather than on every frame composite.  So, I think you are unblocked / have a great solution (in that way, not really a workaround, because you wouldn't want to go back to this way regardless).  That said, this is an issue I will definitely fix in an upcoming release when I have a little more time to dig in.

490,2015-07-07 17:31:29,"@markmark1 there are different techniques, but performing some cropping of the image (and creating a new image that is cropped) is always preferred when possible.  The only case you have to use .cornerRadius is when you have a complex hierarchy of elements that can have content moving both inside and outside the corner-clipped region, but if you have a UI like this, performance is going to be bad on many devices.  At Facebook / Instagram we would often redesign UI specifically to avoid this, and the build system produced huge warnings in diff review for any usage of .cornerRadius, .shadowPath, etc.

For AsyncDisplayKit, there is something called the .imageModificationBlock.  I think there may even be an included block type that does rounded corners (it would be reasonable to add one if there isn't yet).  You can pretty easily create a UIBezierPath instance and call ""clip"" on it, then call ""draw"" on the UIImage in that graphics context.  Let me know if you have any trouble!
",appleguy,markmark1
490,2016-02-08 13:29:35,"@markmark1 the example you linked is not the same as what is recommended here as it creates a mask layer to produce the rounded corners. This is also a time consuming operation as is therefore not recommended. It would be a better choice from a performance perspective to redraw your view using something similar to what @nickvelloff suggested. Note that it doesn't work well if your view should update in any way as it will be statically rendered.

490,2016-02-10 07:34:54,"@macistador I'm running into the statically rendered issue you noted when transitioning to a new custom `UICollectionViewLayout`. Is there another way to get around this issue? 
",nickvelloff,macistador
490,2016-02-16 14:49:20,"@nickvelloff If you have a non-transparent & unicolor background behind your photos, a dirty trick would be to have some kind of transparent resizable image used as a mask; of course this is depend on your different layouts and may not work. For even more flexibility you can imagine a sort of 9-patch system
",macistador,nickvelloff
490,2016-02-16 19:59:19,"@macistador thanks. I was considering the 9 slice approach but had the issue of a gradient background. It may be that just going with a unicolor background or making another design tweak would make this possible. 
",nickvelloff,macistador
490,2016-03-24 17:39:31,"@appleguy Any updates on this one?

`cornerRadius` is sort of important — especially when you want a round border to go around the image as well. This cannot be accomplished via `imageModificationBlock`, can it?

- It appears to me that you're recreating the download task for each new client asking for the resource.  This isn't necessary, right?  In ensuring we only ever create one task, it is very important to consider thread safety, and locking will be required.
- My implementation uses a small custom object for containing the three callback items (queue, progress, completion) and then puts those in an array.  I think this will be measurably more efficient than using dictionaries, although I will not block the review on this because it is a very important correctness fix.

If you're able to ensure that the task is only created once and is thread-safe (so that a caller definitely gets its callback even if the task is finishing right around the moment it's putting in the download request), I'll merge this diff right away and prepare a 1.2.1 release.

If I check whether or not the node being drawn is the container node, and then simply use a frame with a zero origin, it works as expected.

I'm still reading it, and starting to take a detailed look.  My initial feedback:
- I am very happy to see you are adapting the API to Objective-C, and realize this is a ton of work.  It gives me great confidence that we can develop this into a landable version of FlexBox for ASDK, which honestly is a huge achievement (and I can say probably would be our biggest external contribution!)
- Impressed you implemented Layout Nodes.  Could be a good API solution for this; I was personally debating whether we should go that route, or integrate some form of flag / property options on nodes.  Layout nodes are probably the better choice but seemed possibly harder to get right.

I'll try to complete a review during the week, probably with a few different comments as I go.  If we complete and land this, I will definitely roll ASDK v1.3 for it and try to implement a few extra features on the weekends.
",appleguy,nguyenhuy
468,2015-06-20 17:39:39,"@nguyenhuy - Going through the deeper review this weekend.  More soon.
- I'm a bit concerned about the amount of duplication from ComponentKit.  The code is very clean, a testament to that framework in its adaptability, but it also feels like there are some portions of genuinely core functionality (particularly the internals still using C++ and the layout constraint logic).  I'm going to reach out to my friends who authored CK to see if they have any suggestions for a better way.  This code does seem stable enough that a fork is reasonable to consider, though.
- I think profiling will show that the overhead from using NSArray is material.  I saw a couple areas internal to the framework where we created an array just to pass into a method that unpacks the array into the C++ structures.  We don't have to fix this to land, but it would be a high priority to follow up and provide perhaps an internal API for those areas to use a fast-path.
- I have increasing confidence that we should adopt the -calculateLayoutThatFits: pattern.  I'm still thinking carefully about the right data structure for that to return, as well as the ""LayoutNode"" nomenclature.  I think it is a nice parallelism and we might use it as-is, but it could be slightly confusing because it is a fundamentally different type of node than a DisplayNode.  We might be better off avoiding the word Node entirely and calling it an ASLayoutCalculator or ASLayoutSpec, or something else.  Any ideas?

Lastly, could you please rebase this onto 1.2.1?  I am confident that we will land an improved form of this patch in the next ~2 weeks, and would like to make sure it doesn't develop conflicts with other changes.

Firstly, I admit that the ""layout node"" naming convention is somewhat confusing. Since changing it is not difficult but a bit time consuming, I would prefer to do it only once :) I vote for ASLayoutSpec.

> I see ASCompositeNode and have no idea if it's an ASLayoutNode or ASDisplayNode
> Wrapping display nodes in ASCompositeNode is cumbersome and annoying. I don't yet fully understand the importance of ASCompositeNode. 

ASCompositeNode is more like a bridge between ASLayoutNode and ASDisplayNode. There are 2 problems I tried to solve using ASCompositeNode is:
- To identify/indicate where a display subnode is within its parent's layout.
- While calculating, a container ASLayoutNode asks its children to return their layouts. If one of the child layout node happens to be the place where a display node will be attached later on, we must figure out a way to get that display node and ask for its size.

The first problem can also be solved by employing a subnode identifier/tag (which may result in a new required API method in ASDisplayNode). The second problem is more difficult to solve without using a bridge/ASCompositeNode.

> I'm still thinking carefully about the right data structure for that to return

I think we can simplify ASLayout. As you suggested before, we may not need ASLayoutChild, if we have a way to identify each display subnode within its parent. Let me know if you have a better solution in mind.

@nguyenhuy I like the names you mentioned.  Let's lock them down and move forward with the rename.

Can you better explain what you mean by the changes to the ASLayout structure?  I'm happy with the name, but do think that there could be some improvements to what the structure actually contains (IIRC there's an ASLayoutChild or something which seemed probably avoidable).
",appleguy,markmark1
468,2015-06-30 13:49:33,"@appleguy Few new changes:
- ASLayoutChild is gone, for good.
- ASLayout now has a position, defaults to CGPointNull (NAN, NAN). I also added some asserts to make sure a valid position is set once (and only once) to sublayouts.
- ASDisplayNode now stores a flattened ASLayout. This should help reduce memory footprint and give -layout a boost.

An uncompressed ASLayout actually contains both layout specs and subnodes. So sublayouts looks like a better name. I will fix all naming issues altogether, which looks like the only task left in this PR. It's exciting to see how this PR evolves and get very close to this merge-able state. Thanks everyone for your input :+1: 
",nguyenhuy,appleguy
468,2015-06-30 21:39:34,"@nguyenhuy great step with what are probably the final structural changes; I appreciate the strategy of keeping the renames separate.  Let's get that big push in and then do a final detailed review.  I will prioritize breaking out future changes into separate improvement diffs so we can land the large one soon, assuming the API is solid as it is harder to change.
",appleguy,nguyenhuy
468,2015-07-02 05:06:55,"Phenomenal, thanks @nguyenhuy!  I will review this in detail as soon as I can — first thing on Saturday morning (possibly Friday night).  Are there any remaining issues you're aware of?  Could you think through any APIs added or changed on ASDisplayNode and consider what it would be like to explain their purpose and functionality to a new developer, and think if that story is easy to explain?
",appleguy,nguyenhuy
468,2015-07-02 05:46:27,"@appleguy awesome. Thanks.

Regarding API changes in ASDisplayNode. I think newly-updated documentation of [ASDisplayNode+Subclasses.h](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/468/files#diff-21f895ebcd9f9959caa2826a33f74315R112) explains the idea quite clearly (or maybe not). Anyway, let me try to explain it again here:

The main APIs added to ASDisplayNode are 2 new methods -layoutSpecThatFits: and -calculateLayoutThatFits:. Those methods, together with the existing -calculateSizeThatFits:, help to cover most (if not all) use cases:
- Manual layout: supported by implementing -calculateSizeThatFits: (**and** -layout). This is the model used by current clients and there are no breaking changes introduced.
- Auto layout: supported by implementing -layoutSpecThatFits:. This should be the recommended model once this PR is merged.
- Semi-auto layout: supported by implementing -calculateLayoutThatFIts:. This should be considered as an advanced model and should rarely be used. The implementation of -calculateLayoutThatFIts: needs to construct and return a compressed 1-level deep ASLayout that describes the node's size, as well as position and size of subnodes. As long as a correct ASLayout is returned, it will be safely cached and correctly used by -layout.

There are no high-level, structural issues that I'm aware of. However there are 2 minor concerns I'm having in mind:
- [Static layout spec](https://github.com/nguyenhuy/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/layout_node/AsyncDisplayKit/Layout/ASStaticLayoutSpec.h):
  - It can be helpful to describe a static part of the layout. But it requires a bit of learning to use correctly (new ASStaticLayoutChild and some size types).
  - I'm thinking about eliminating ASStaticLayoutChild (by using the same way we eliminate ASStackLayoutChild), but it leads to another concern (adding position and size to ASLayoutable will cause confusion).
  - Perhaps we should just remove it completely, or leave it there and wait for feedbacks?
- (Yet another) naming convention issue: ASLayoutSpec calls its sub-ASLayoutable objects ""children"". I didn't rename the property to subLayoutables because the new name doesn't sound good either. I think it is not really a critical issue and we can live with it for now?

It does look like this is a bit more complicated than this diff can address right now, so I'm going to keep the task open (and reference this diff) but close the PR.  There is a possibility of integrating a slightly newer text layout system from ComponentKit that is likely to fix some corner cases like this.

458,2015-06-23 05:01:29,"I think I fixed this with my tracking set.  It probably has horrible overhead, but I believe it eliminated these orphaned pending indices.

Check out the NSMutableSet in https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/496/files

Thanks @eanagel for discovering the original issue here, as adding the set was super easy in comparison!

457,2015-06-14 21:03:41,"@ajk198 Thanks for the report — I think this is a real issue.  Because shouldRasterize being YES allows the system to avoid allocating any layers or views for that tree (can be a huge savings), there aren't any backing objects to call layout.  This was not a problem for Paper's layout system, but clearly is for most apps!

The workaround you described is completely safe, and essentially the same thing that a system fix will do.  We just need to install -layout calls in the logic that already recursively visits each node during rasterization.
",appleguy,ajk198
457,2015-06-23 05:02:56,"@ajk198 that is a very correct observation that many people don't realize ;).

Despite that, though, it will take sufficiently long to rewrite that having a nearer term fix is tremendously valuable — it will reduce time pressure on the replacement and allow us to ensure it is much better tested, and has a better API (the data lock should be eliminated by simply asserting data modification happens on main, which should be the only sane architecture for most apps anyway; layout, rendering, etc will still be automatically asynchronous)

435,2015-06-23 17:55:25,"@xujim thanks again for this.  We have some exciting new improvements to ASCollectionView Layout support that I think will make this even better.

The framework should now support using any UICollectionViewLayout, and is no longer limited to only Flow layouts.  I think that should mean that this class no longer needs to conform to the ASLayoutController protocol.

Importantly, I believe the way this was originally implemented was not thread safe.  Because it derives from UICollectionViewLayout, it would mean that the ASLayoutController reference created by ASRangeController would be created and used off the main thread.  This may work, but is not necessarily safe to do since UIKit makes no guarantees about supporting this kind of usage.

I am actually supportive of including a couple UICollectionViewLayout classes with ASDK because it could help developers implement what they need even more easily, although this could technically be a separate github project.  If you can take a pass at cleaning it up to integrate with master / intended for use as a UICollectionViewLayout instead of an ASLayoutController, I think we could more easily evaluate how it should be merged.
",appleguy,xujim
435,2015-06-28 05:02:42,"@xujim, check out the master branch for these changes.  Namely, there is now ASCollectionViewLayoutController, which allows usage of any UICollectionViewLayout with ASCollectionView (no longer flow layouts only).

In thinking about this, it is possible that your implementation is more efficient than it could otherwise be if contained in a UICollectionViewLayout because it has a more specifically targeted API for usage with ASDK.  That said, I think it's important to better understand that impact; it may be very small, in which case we should prefer providing a UICollectionViewLayout implementation.

Let me know if you plan to spend any further time here.  If you'll be unavailable for a while, we can let this sit or save the code for follow-up in a Github Issue.

435,2015-09-24 23:41:46,"@erema glad you found a resolution!  The crash you indicated shows entirely UIKit APIs / errors, and I'm not sure it is related to ASDK (or at least, I can't from the information provided see how it would be).

One quick thing to try would be to switch to UICollectionView (instead of ASCollectionView), just as a test.  You would have to implement the cellForItemAtIndexPath: and possibly the size method as well, just like a normal UICollectionView, instead of nodeForRowAtIndexPath which replaces a couple of them.  I have a hunch that you will hit the same crash.

If you want to share the project or more of the code, we might be able to debug it!  Let me know if you get to a solution or have any additional questions, happy to help however I can.

To answer your questions:
- I am on version 1.2 of AsyncDisplayKit
- before this crash, I had asyncdatafetching turned on, and was exeriencing a different crash 100% of the time, so I turned it off. After turning it off, I would experience the above crash every 2-3 times restarting my app (table view is in the root viewcontroller). I believe the issue has to do w calling reload data too many ones before the tableview is even displaying anything, just a hunch as removing an extra call to reloaddata stopped the crash.

We did look at this one when it came in, but at that time were intending to rewrite ASDataController imminently.  That work is still planned, but as you can see, has been delayed.  My goal is to do the rewrite by the end of the month, but there's risk in it slipping (especially when testing, etc is considered).

395,2015-07-05 20:02:54,"@arik-so thanks for your thoughts on this.  It's definitely the case that ASTableView is not directly compatible with UITableViewController, if the latter sets the dataSource property instead of asyncDataSource (which it sounds like it does do).

We strongly recommend against using Interface Builder (for many reasons, it is not allowed for production implementation at Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and the overwhelming majority of the apps that come with iOS).  However, recently there was initWithCoder: support added to ASTableView so you can technically create the table itself from Interface Builder.  This is pretty much unsupported though.

362,2015-03-11 11:02:32,"Hi @kratijain-flipkart,

If you are on master, you can increase the working range so that the image can be downloaded much earlier. (See `- [ASTableView setTuningParameters:forRangeType:]`)

---

ASDK does not provide a caching support for image but does provide hooks for caching to be supported through 3rd party implementation. In my case I used `SDWebImage`.





In order to use the above code, you just have to do this.

362,2015-03-11 20:40:55,"> If you are on master, you can increase the working range so that the image can be downloaded much earlier. (See - [ASTableView setTuningParameters:forRangeType:])

Working ranges have been configurable since AsyncDisplayKit 1.0 via the `rangeTuningParameters` property, so you actually don't need to be on master to increase the range's size.  The API @lxcid mentioned will be released in ASDK 1.2 because we're now differentiating between ""rendering"" and ""network"" ranges — you can, e.g. enable 1-screenful render-ahead but 3-screenful download-ahead.

> ASDK does not provide a caching support for image but does provide hooks for caching to be supported through 3rd party implementation.

Note that if you're using the default downloader, your requests are cached — ASBasicImageDownloader uses NSURLSession, which uses your app's shared NSURLCache.  `[[ASNetworkImageNode alloc] init]` should Just Work™ out of the box; if you require a more flexible or explicit cacheing strategy, you can easily implement your own.  @ide's [WebASDKImageManager](https://github.com/ide/WebASDKImageManager) may also be worth a look.

361,2015-06-14 21:02:45,"@appleguy Yep, I'm using ASTableView. Pin-to-top behaviour is the main reason I'm using the section headers (one per post, so there are a lot of views being initialised and sized on table reload).

Its a pretty simple workaround where in `tableView:viewForHeaderInSection:` I load an `ASDisplayNode` (the header node) on a background thread and then jump to the main thread and add the header node to a `UITableViewHeaderFooterView`.

My solution works well enough where scrolling over very large datasets and frame rates remain high and there is no slowdown while scrolling. However, I would strongly suggest you switch to a ASCollectionView. I've found using an `ASTableView` for this pin-to-top behavior is really not supported with the current implementation. I've run into a number of issues trying to use `ASTableView` this way and will have to switch to another solution before I can release my app to the store. 

I spent a good bit of time reading over the code to better understand how tableviews and collectionviews are implemented, with the hopes of putting together a pull request to get ASTableView production ready when used in this pin-to-top behavior. @appleguy will have a much better handle on it, but it appeared to be a major undertaking to nail down and fix all the issues I've run into.

349,2015-03-12 00:29:03,"I've dug into this a little and I agree with @lxcid.  The empty proxy is an unsafe convenience, and we're going to have to fall back to asserting that `asyncDelegate` is non-nil.  More details, for the curious:

The UITableViewDelegate protocol declares conformance with the public NSObject _protocol_; to a first approximation the protocol is interchangeable with the NSObject _class_, but the two are not identical.  `_accessibilitySetRetainedValue:forKey:`, which is SPI defined on the NSObject class [in the AccessibilityStorage category](https://github.com/mattlawer/iOS6-Private-Frameworks/blob/master/UIAccessibility/NSObject-AccessibilityStorage.h), is one such difference.

So, UIScrollViewAccessibility takes an NSObject-protocol-conforming object, assumes it's NSObject-class-conforming, and calls private methods on it without `-respondsToSelector:` checks.  Since our proxy isn't an NSObject… :boom:!

Changing `_ASTableViewProxy` to inherit from NSObject is one possible fix, but rapidly swapping out delegates — the proxy at init-time, then consumer code shortly thereafter — is an edge case which might break the accessibility subsystem in a much more subtle way.  (Yes, [NSProxy is broken](http://lists.apple.com/archives/cocoa-dev/2006/Mar/msg00716.html), but obvious bugs are preferable to sneaky ones.)  Dropping the empty proxy is our best bet.

1. Embarrassing, but I'm actually not sure how the linter is set up for ASDK if we have one.  If there's an oclint configuration in the project, run it!  I haven't been doing this on my changes, lol.
2. I wouldn't worry about updating the docs as a blocker for this, but yes, if you can update the gh-pages branch with any relevant information then that would be really cool.  There are also generated doc pages (accessible from some links on asyncdisplaykit.org) but those are created by running a script on the codebase, scraped from the specific comment format that we use in header files.  We are due to re-generate them now, actually (although it's possible @secretiverhyme set up a magical automatic updating script :) )

Oh, one last question:
As far as testing goes, I noticed there aren't any tests for ASNetworkImageNode but there were ASMultiplexImageNode tests around more complicated functionality.  Is the idea that you only put tests in for stuff that seems like it really needs it?  That's what it seems like, but I figured I might as well ask to make sure.
",lappp9,appleguy
347,2015-06-23 17:23:13,"@lappp9 Test coverage in ASDK is acceptable, but definitely incomplete.  To be honest, it's tough to have a test that hurts — even simple tests are nice to have, as long as they are not redundant.  For example, you would not want to test basic properties of ASDisplayNode on ASNetworkImageNode, like verifying that .bounds is the same as what you set it to, but checking features of ASNetworkImageNode itself could be useful.

344,2015-03-03 14:23:53,"I followed @secretiverhyme recommendation and tried out BKDeltaCalculator. I still face some issue when it come to wrapping delta changes in begin and end updates.

BKDeltaCalculator calculate insert and delete changes accurately, but at the same time it generates a lot of move changes that are resultant from the insert and delete changes. Technically they are accurate and when applied to UITableView, it work as expected, UITableView will not animate those extra move changes.

When I use it with ASTableView, I notice some issues. To better explains I had to use an example:

Lets say I have an initial array of `[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]`. I would like to insert `0` to the front and remove the last element, in this case `5`. The final array should look like `[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]`.

BKDeltaCalculator will generate the following delta results, insert at index 0, delete at index 4 and move at `0 to 1`, `1 to 2`, `2 to 3` and `3 to 4`.

If this is applied to `UITableView`, only the insert and delete are animated, the move are ignored.

If this is applied to `ASTableView`, the first node get a refresh but not updated, it is still showing the old node, even though the new node is being queried through `tableView:nodeForRowAtIndexPath:`.

Initially I thought if I calculated the correct move, things will work alright and true enough the problem is gone.

Then come another issue, If I ever use `reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:withRowAnimation:` in begin and end updates, it is unclear if the method uses the data prior to the begin and end updates or uses the latest state of the data.

Let say, I tried to reload the those unchanged cells (basically those cell that are calculated as moved in BKDeltaCalculator). If I use the old index paths, it will complains that the animation clashes with the insertion index (0). If I use the new index paths, it will complains that the animation clashes with the deletion index (4).

UITableView documents did specify that reload is similar to delete so it uses the old index paths.

This is currently my finding. I'll try to extend kitten to illustrates the problem if possible.
",lxcid,secretiverhyme
344,2015-03-03 16:19:01,"@asolakhyan Thanks! Glad to know I'm not the only one facing the issue.

I fork and branch ASDK here (https://github.com/lxcid/AsyncDisplayKit/tree/bug/delta-changes) to illustrate the problem.

You can tweak the `USE_UIKIT` between `0` and `1` to switch between ASDK and UIKit implementation. You need to update the pod first.

I also notice that if I use `asyncDataFetching`, it will crash.

So basically, UIKit function as intended, ASDK without async works but the update is wrong. ASDK with async crashes.

Disappointed that it took a year to fix this bug, but at least I can say with confidence that the framework development has been focused on some really big things in the meantime. It is now absolutely time to clean up and improve the batch fetching APIs though. This will be fixed in the next release.

@maicki, this change reproduces the issue. If the user initiates a drag, even though it will rubber band back into place, that will trigger the load. I think that is why this issue has not been widely reported. Probably the right thing to do is to use a new Hook from the ranch controller to check whether a batch fetch needs to be triggered, because the range controller runs its update pass in a variety of situations including edit operations and the appearance or disappearance of cells.

338,2015-03-10 20:27:13,"@tanliboy and @secretiverhyme  could you perhaps share the current plans for the future of the locking mechanism and the asynchronous fetching? I've been using it since it was released and I'm very happy with the results, though I of course fully realize that we need to take in account as much use cases as possible. 

While reading this discussion the following idea popped up in my head.

In light of the idea of creating ASDK components as drop in replacements for their UIKit counterparts, wouldn't it make things easier if we make ASCollectionView/ASTableView in sync fetching mode more like their UIKit counterparts? In the current implementation it's fine to call reloadData or the editing methods from a background queue, but as @cfcommando already pointed it this is already a departure from the way the UIKit components work. And I think that makes the use of ASDK more complex and increases the risk of errors because methods like nodeForItemAtIndexPath: can be called from any queue, and the implementation of that method needs to take that into account. If you'd have the ASDK components work on the main thread when they're in sync mode they would be a lot more like their UIKit counterparts.

I realize that this might go against the goals of ASDK but in my opinion it would make things more logical. That way you can just use it the same way you used the UIKit components and in this scenario you would still benefit from the preload ranges ASDK uses.

This would, in my opinion, also justify a more complex API for when you're using asynchronous fetching. You can use the ASDK components the same way you'd use the UIKit components and still benefit from some of the ASDK goodies but if you want the whole package you need to take that into account with your data management. 

That's my 2 cents, wondering how you guys see this.

By the way I would also be more than willing to do some writing for the guides or create a sample project to make the asynchronous fetching API more accessible to other developers, once you make a decision about this part of the API.

The asyncDataFetching option has been disabled, then deprecated for quite some time because of this problem.  So it hasn't been hurting folks.  Nodes are still pretty cheap to allocate, and so only complex apps or apps that add fairly expensive custom logic to init (perhaps data detectors or other things) will find this is essential, but it is so easy to adopt that there is no reason not to.

I am experiencing the same, and solved using the following method:
- In `viewWillLayoutSubviews`, where the node frame is set, wrap the layout code in an if statement that checks if the node has an animation:



This resolved my issue. One thing is that once the animation is complete, the if statement will execute and your node will receive a `setFrame` call, which is why it's important to make sure the frame matches the `toValue` you used when setting up your animation

Answers could vary depending on whether you're using physics-simulating animations or UIView / CA animations, but most importantly, it depends on what part of the cell you're animating (the entire thing?  elements within it?  is it possible they may not have loaded from the network yet and need to animate when they're done?  etc)

334,2016-02-22 18:34:32,"@appleguy, I'll bite on the above since I'm trying to accomplish what sounds like a very similar thing. What I'm trying to do is create a subnode within an ASCellNode (with ASTableView) which holds an image placeholder at first (with a preferredFrameSize set to 200 height, say), then when the image finishes downloading I would like to: 
1. the placeholder should animate to the right height based on the image received, then 
2. The image should grow from the center and use a pop animation to 'spring' into the placeholder from the center (a grow effect) 

Right now in an attempt to get 1. working I am using the technique discussed in #718 to update layout, but what happens is that the image gets inserted first instantaneously, _and _then_ everything scoots down to fit it, but things are hidden behind the image in the transient state. 2 above I haven't even attempted yet as a result, but if you had any thoughts/issues/sample code you think would be helpful on one or both, it would be much appreciated!

From what I recall, animating worked fine, but it broke down when we started trying to control the transition via gesture recognizer. 

With our current implementation much of the scaling work is done within a subclass of `UICollectionViewCell` via `applyLayoutAttributes:layoutAttributes`. The cell is given (zoom) transition progress, and derives frame / layout properties from its knowledge of the start and end zoom sizes, etc.

We're not completely satisfied with the results however, so we've just recently started looking into this again.

310,2015-11-01 03:52:24,"@phatmann hey, sorry it took literally months for me to reply here :).  I recently turned off placeholderEnabled by default on ASTextNode because of this.  You're absolutely right that there is some significant cost here.

My original intent for the text placeholder implementation was to use individual CALayers, with simple .backgroundColor values to avoid any memory allocation / backing stores as well as CPU drawing with CoreGraphics (both of which are happening with the current implementation).  There would be a way to do this super-efficiently by reusing a cache of CALayers maintained at the ASTextNode class level, where as soon as a node is finished rendering / can remove its placeholder state, the layers are tossed back in for reuse.  Layers are so vastly faster than views to add and remove (as well as create + destroy) that I'm pretty convinced this would be an extremely low overhead solution for this feature.

I'm going to repurpose this task to track implementing that improvement.  If anyone from the community can jump on this, I think it would be a pretty fun project :)

309,2016-04-02 05:27:33,"@phatmann: if you are still using the framework, check out the nodeBlock*: API. It allows the dataSource to return a block created on the main thread specifically so that any data model objects may be pulled out and preserved consistency with the indexPaths, but the cell node objects are then allocated and initialized concurrently in the background and subsequently also measured concurrently. 

This is a significant improvement over the previous behavior, but does not fundamentally address the fact that edit operations will block on unfinished concurrent background operations. This use case is far more painful in UIKit as it will block the main thread for the entire duration, and take roughly twice as long to complete text sizing as it is not concurrent. For the time being, the best solution is to ""virtualize"" the dataSource and inform the ASTableView about a smaller number of objects and add more as they are needed. 

This is a reasonable feature request, but will involve a pretty significant amount of work for a benefit that will not be at all detectable for most application access patterns. I will log the request in our internal bug tracker, and am happy to help you optimize out these kind of bottlenecks if your application is still being negatively affected by them.

297,2015-02-09 00:24:44,"@kylehickinson  Right now  my root UIviewController is holding this very simple ASCollectionView. The images are attatched to the ASCellNode class in collectionView(collectionView: ASCollectionView!, nodeForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath!) with a constant size. The layout doesn't depended on the image in any way.
When the app loads, the nodes are sized and rendered asynchronously on a background thread (right?), but then the images are only displayed on screen after that process is done for all the cells. For a couple thousand  images this is actually pretty fast, only a few seconds, but it gets really bad beyond that.
I was thinking I could use the node's **displaysAsynchronously** flag to disable the async magic and perhaps force the images to display before the all the content is  fully-rendered and ready to go, but i haven't tried it yet. 
",blessingLopes,kylehickinson
297,2015-02-09 03:13:49,"@blessingLopes: @tanliboy might be better suited to answer this but i'll give it a shot:

When `ASCollectionView` begins to load your cells, it loads many `ASCellNode` objects at once and sizes them (I don't believe the process of allocating each is asynchronous and by this I mean each cell is allocated sequentially, but the layout and rendering is, someone can correct me on this!).  This means you'll see your `nodeForItemAtIndexPath` called consecutively until it reaches the end (does it still do this post-batch updating merge @tanliboy or is it only working range cells that get allocated now?).  Meaning if you're doing any image decoding (e.g. calling `UIImage(named: dataSource[indexPath.item])`)  in this call or in your `ASCellNode` subclass `init` method then it must wait to decode said images until it can continue and begin showing your table.  

Not only that, since `ASCellNode` is not reused, if you give the cell a strong reference to an image, it will live in memory until that cell is destroyed for some reason (like from a `reloadData` call).  This can bring a lot of memory pressure quick and In my experience caused an out-of-memory crash at some point once it begins to render many many images.

By moving your image decoding to a on-screen basis (and making sure to dump it from memory in either the exit hierarchy call or in an overridden `reclaimMemory` method) you cut all of that processing required to allocate and size each cell, so it can get to the whole showing your table part faster.

Maybe's there's an even better solution to all of this, but I haven't had too much time to experiment other then using the `willEnter/didExitHierarchy` methods.  Perhaps `didLoad` could work also?

1) For memory usage: Try use ASLazyImageNode instead of UIImage view to achieve memory management and loading performance.
2) For ASCollectionView performance: Initialize the table with few cells (maybe 100 in your case, and you may only need to change the return value of ""numberOfItemsInSection""), and then call the ""insertItemsAtIndexPaths"" from background thread.

297,2015-02-09 04:06:59,"In general, if you're using ASNetworkImageNode or ASMultiplexImageNode, everything should Just Work(tm).  As to the 50-second slowdown on app launch... that's #288.

Unfortunately, in order to support edit/update methods on ASTableView and ASCollectionView, we had to make data loading thread-affined:  if you call `-insertSections:` on a background queue, nodes will be processed on that queue, but when UIKit initially renders ASTV and ASCV, it processes nodes on the main thread.  For now, you need to start out with an empty data source and then add all content (e.g., using `-insertSections:`) on a background queue to avoid blocking with large data sets.  This is clearly not great, but improving it is possible now that editing support has stabilised.  =]

@kylehickinson, here's a bit of context on `-willEnterHierarchy`/`-didExitHierarchy` and friends (cc @rnystrom, who's working on the changes described here in #285):

We originally built AsyncDisplayKit as a necessary first step before building [Paper](http://facebook.com/paper).  The Paper story strip isn't a UICollectionView and its working range isn't powered by ASRangeController.  Since it isn't a UIKit component and isn't based on view reuse, its working range directly corresponds to ""everything in the view hierarchy"" — Paper keeps many card nodes offscreen, and uses `-removeFromSuperview` to keep memory usage in check.  `-didExitHierarchy` was therefore the logical place to free up memory (images, text rendering objects, and the like).

Of course, this design doesn't work in apps that use standard UIKit components and navigation!  Even scrolling through an ASTableView or ASCollectionView is enough to trigger many `-willEnterHierarchy` and `-didExitHierarchy` calls as the cells are reused (NB: ASCellNodes are not reused, but their containing cells are).  So, we replaced `-willEnterHierarchy` with `-displayWillStart` and introduced `-reclaimMemory` in lieu of `-didExitHierarchy` (79e65342b1b1273130392d75867ded5d793a7074).

This works for nodes that implement custom drawing, as ASTextNode and ASImageNode do, but it's only a first step.  For the ASDK 1.2 release, we're changing these subclass hooks to something like this (method names not final):

**rendering range** — formerly ""working range"", most people won't need to use these:
- `-displayWillStart` — called as nodes enter the working range and first start rendering
- `-clearRendering` — called as nodes exit the rendering range and should clear their backing stores

**network range:**
- `-fetchRemoteContent` — the appropriate place for custom nodes to load data, e.g., downloading images from the network
- `-clearFetchedContent` — called as nodes exit the network range and should clear their fetched content

This should hopefully be clearer and offer more flexibility.  It'll be possible to tune the rendering and network ranges, and they'll differ by default.  This will let you, for example, keep a small number of fully-rendered decompressed JPEGs around (`layer.contents`) but store a larger number of downloaded compressed JPEGs (`.image`).

All nodes are immediately sized when the app loads, but rendering is limited to the contents of the [working range](http://asyncdisplaykit.org/guide/3/).  The system is designed to prioritise responsiveness and only render what's onscreen or will be onscreen soon — if you're seeing laggy image rendering with ASNetworkImageNode or ASMultiplexImageNode, that's a bug we'd love to fix.  =]

294,2015-02-07 21:22:12,"@andyscott I would avoid calling `-measure:` unless your node sizes itself based on content. Typically you would create an `ASDisplayNode` subclass and override `-calculateSizeThatFits:`, like we do [here](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/examples/Kittens/Sample/KittenNode.m#L127-136). In there you should call `-measure:` on subnodes. If you follow this pattern, no matter how deep your hierarchy is you should be just fine.

Adding a node's backing view/layer to another UIView will set the layer as needing display, the display runloop will eventually call `display` on the `CALayer`, which triggers the node machinery to do the async process. So you shouldn't have to worry about calling `-measure:` yourself.

Also remember that some of the benefit of using ASDK is to both asynchronously render **and size**. If you call `-measure:` in `-viewWillLayoutSubviews` you're sizing on the main thread.

ASDisplayNode is intended to support synchronous wrapper nodes as first-class nodes — they should be indistinguishable from any other node with asynchronous display disabled.  So, instead of creating an additional wrapper-only node, we should fix these problems in the base node class.

It looks like this is more or less the same line of thought as #109 (which I haven't gotten to yet — sorry @aleclarson!).  @ide, if you'd like to hoist this functionality into the base node and add CALayer support, I'd be happy to merge it in and close both PRs.  =]

My recommendation would be to set `placeholderEnabled = NO` on any text nodes that don't need placeholders. I did this on your sample project and it removed the flickering issue (check the [pull request](https://github.com/lavoy/ASTextProject/pull/1) I sent to your repo).

",wockerwalker,secretiverhyme
211,2015-01-22 19:44:36,"@wockerwalker, are these ASCellNode initialisations blocking content from appearing onscreen?  If so, that's a bug that should've been fixed already (#200).  Otherwise, that's currently expected behaviour — ASTableView and ASCollectionView asynchronously allocate and measure all cell nodes, using the working range and `-reclaimMemory` to make sure memory usage stays low.
",secretiverhyme,wockerwalker
211,2015-01-22 21:31:08,"@secretiverhyme: no, they aren’t blocking the initial content from appearing onscreen promptly. it’s helpful to know that the async allocation and measurement of all nodes is expected behavior. that said, even though initial content propagates without delay, the CPU churns for a long while finishing all the other inits and measurements in the background. for a larger data source (~1000+), it’s unfortunate to be initializing and measuring a cell hundreds or thousands of rows away that the user may never see. this seems like one of the only large conceptual disadvantages of ASTableView over the stock UITableView, which inits and calculates those heights on the fly. (i also consistently get memory warnings when working with a data source this large on ASDK.) this leads me to a few questions:
    - is this behavior expected to change in a future update?
    - in the meantime, are there best practices for keeping ASCellNode -init methods lightweight, and subsequently performing those aspects of initialization not impacting measurement closer to display time?
    - are there any workarounds, such as feeding the ASTableView data in chunks, that you would recommend?

thanks for your help and patience!
",wockerwalker,secretiverhyme
211,2015-01-23 00:00:01,"@wockerwalker — yes, we're planning changes to this behaviour in order to better handle large data sets (cc @rnystrom).  ASTableView and ASCollectionView currently blindly instantiate and measure _all_ available nodes as soon as they're available, but the ""a node is never onscreen if it hasn't been measured"" invariant can be preserved with incremental loading.  We're thinking of adapting the working range to only instantiate nodes when they're likely to be needed / destroy them as necessary for memory warnings.

For a stopgap measure, your suggestion of feeding ASTableView data in chunks — tail-loading, à la infinite scroll — is your best bet.  It's possible to have your code execute closer to display time using, for example, `-displayWillStart`, but this may actually be detrimental depending on what you're trying to do.

Hope this helps!  =]

204,2015-06-15 00:38:32,"@geoffmacd This is a good question and I wanted to answer it when I first saw it submitted way back in January — sorry I never got around to it!

The mechanism I've used is as simple as manually profiling your app (Time Profiler in Instruments).  Then look for time on the main thread.  Any time over about 10ms, especially if you know it will happen within a single runloop (e.g. call stack growing and then collapsing back to the base) will cause frame drops for scrolling, gestures, and physics-simulating animations.

The FPS measurement is not very useful because you may be holding a pretty high average FPS, but then drop a bunch of frames together; or only drop one frame per second, but it still feels bad.  Basically FPS measurement does not correlate well with the human perception of the user experience.

For ""reloadData"" of ASDataController, we want to make sure the compute extensive operations (e.g. layout) are done in background thread, so we do it in async mode and it may be batched in several groups for updating. On another hand, in the initialization of UITableView, the ""reloadData"" will be invoked by the UITableView on main thread. Delaying ""reloadData"" function call of UITableView after the updating of ""_nodes"" will block the initialization of UITableView.

When `placeholderFadesOut` is true, the placeholder will fade out with a (almost unnoticeable) fixed duration of 0.1. When false, the placeholder layer is immediately removed, leaving no chance for it to be animated.

Allowing more advanced, or totally custom, animations has a lot of edge cases that will need to be covered. Exposing the `_placeholderLayer` entirely is something we want to avoid so that the inner machinery doesn't get out of sync.

The only other difference I can see is I've assigned displaysAsynchronously = NO on this cell, however neither setting alters the behaviour.

Hm, curious.  ASDisplayNode's `.backgroundColor` property [is applied to its layer, not its view](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/AsyncDisplayKit/Private/ASDisplayNode%2BUIViewBridge.mm#L385).  What happens if you override `-setBackgroundColor:` in SettingsSwitchNode?

110,2014-11-16 19:22:30,"@aleclarson thanks for the sample code.  Do you have any particular need to use nodes all the way up to the window level?  There isn't anything wrong with doing that, but one of the reasons ASTableView is a view instead of a node is that it will be a common transition point from views -> nodes.  So, it may be even easier to ditch the node wrapper on your window and table.

That said, I still like the principle here, but I'm not sure that loadNode is the right name for this functionality.  Further, it seems like there is a bit of a functionality clash between the Class-based initializers, and the block based initializer.  Perhaps we should standardize on the block and do something like initWithLoadBlock:
",appleguy,aleclarson
110,2014-11-17 20:37:55,"Hm.  ASTableView is an ideal view → node transition point, but there are clear reasons to want to use ASTableView in an all-node hierarchy.  Point-conversion methods can simply be replaced with their UIKit equivalents—



—but you'd want a coherent node hierarchy to enable preloading offscreen ASTableViews in, say, a tabbed or paging-based interface.

The current approach in this pull request is unsafe, and I'm not sure offhand whether any of AsyncDisplayKit's machinery will break if node hierarchies skip levels in their corresponding view hierarchies (`cell.supernode.view != cell.view.superview` — @appleguy, am I forgetting something?).  Assuming that's not problematic, we could add a new property to ASCellNode, set internally by ASTableView:



and do something like this (untested):



This is ugly, but par for the course with UIKit-AsyncDisplayKit bridging.  We shouldn't add special cases to the base ASDK logic — e.g., `_ASDisplayNodeFindClosestCommonAncestor()` shouldn't be aware of ASTableView — so this might be the best solution.  Thoughts?

The critical distinction here is that ASTextNode substantially benefits from asynchronous sizing and rendering, but any UIScrollView implementation will only ever be concerned with synchronous behaviour.  Since ASTableView and ASCollectionView are not nodes and will still inherit from UIScrollView even if we build a custom scroll node, we're not left with a compelling enough reason to reinvent this particular wheel.

isRasterizing will only ever be YES if your app does use subtree rasterization (you have to explicitly turn it on).  When this method is called for any node in a subtree that is marked for rasterization, the current graphics context (which is affected by things like [[UIColor whiteColor] set]) is a ""shared"" context that is moved around and clipped according to the node being asked to draw.  In some cases, you may want to set a special blend mode to change how the content is composited together.  In fact, you can use this technique to achieve visual effects that are not directly supported by Core Animation's compositor.

isCancelled is a block (called isCancelledBlock) that you can call periodically in your draw implementation to bail out of drawing early if it is no longer needed.  Imagine an app with a very complex type of view, such as a custom vector map, and the user is scrolling past many of them quickly.  When they are far enough off screen (as defined by the working range adjustments on ASRangeController, or your own similar mechanism), any rendering in progress should be cancelled with recursiveSetPreventOrCancelDisplay:.  If you don't do this, the new content coming onscreen may be queued behind a long list of other things trying to render, many of which may not be important anymore.

Library class like ASTextNode already implement this cancellation behavior for you.  It's important to note that not all rendering operations can be cancelled at any point.  In the middle of decoding an image, for example, there isn't a good way to abort the operation.  But, for multi-stage operations (such as ASTextNode drawing a gaussian shadow with text or other effects), you can call the isCancelledBlock in between them, and if it returns YES, clean up and return from the draw method as soon as possible (because any further work would be wasted).

Hopefully the stream-of-consciousness explanation makes sense, and please feel free to post in Paper Engineering Community (https://www.facebook.com/groups/551597518288687/) with any other questions you can think of :)

_webNode = [[ASDisplayNode] initWithViewClass:[WKWebView class]];

However, as documented in the description of -initWithViewClass and -initWithLayerClass:, this node will still be synchronously rendered.  It will integrate nicely with other ASDisplayNodes, but it's always possible to add a web view to a node hierarchy without wrapping anyway: [node.view addSubview:webView];  This construction just makes it easier to do [_webNode addSubnode:anotherNodeWithinWebNode];.

70,2014-10-22 22:03:31,"@RuiAAPeres, thanks for the question!  The technology you're referring to from the video is called Components.  It can be thought of as a declarative, immutable version of the core concepts behind AsyncDisplayKit, but ASDK predates Components by about two years and they are implemented separately.  There is no active work to open source Components, but that doesn't mean it won't happen.  The team is currently focused on getting it shipped in the main FBiOS app.

The core difference between the two frameworks has to do with imperative vs declarative design.  Components is more similar to React; it is declarative and essentially forces single-directional data flow, often with immutable intermediates that are re-created instead of modified as changes require.  AsyncDisplayKit is more similar to UIKit; it is imperative and just like UIView, user input can often change state without completely replacing it with a new immutable object.

As with anything, there are pros and cons of each approach.  We've found in practice that declarative code tends to be shorter and more concise, but there is a learning curve because it has a very different ""feel"" than any experienced iOS engineer will be familiar with.  More importantly, part of the point of the declarative model is to limit API surface area and the number of ways in which bugs can be introduced (race conditions, etc)—but sacrificing some of this flexibility does have impacts, particularly on how interactive interfaces and animations are implemented.  It's possible to implement animations with Components, but it's often more complex to achieve a polished effect than with an imperative design (and in many other cases, it is not technically feasible).

So, they're useful for different situations.  Neither one is perfect for the majority of apps.  At the highest level, if your app has a lot of repeated structures and layout rules (think the main feed of Facebook for iOS, which is what Components was directly designed for), with little interactivity and animation, then Components is a huge boon for reducing code complexity and sources of bugs.  If you have a highly interactive app with parts of the UI that animate into different states to become new parts of the UI, physics, gestures, etc...it will be between difficult and impossible to use the Components strategy exclusively, so a hybrid approach combining both may be possible.

Let me know if you have any other questions on this.
",appleguy,RuiAAPeres
70,2014-10-22 22:14:08,"thanks for the answer @appleguy. I actually got another question: how does Components looks like? As in, is it a class that just encapsulate a piece of a `UIView`? At first I thought it could potentially encapsulate a `CALAyer` but then again you need the interactivity (clicking the like button for example). Could you give a brief description about what a Component is and what's its interaction with UIKit? In the end that ""Story"", that belongs to a ""Feed"", need to be showed in a VC's root view, correct?
",RuiAAPeres,appleguy
70,2014-10-24 00:54:22,"@RuiAAPeres it will be up to the Components team to decide when to release more information than is in the presentation, but Components was partially inspired by the view /or/ layer-backing capability of ASDisplayNode.  It is one of the main optimizations that justifies the ""abstraction cost"" over using basic UIViews.  Currently both systems use layer backing only where touch handling is not needed, but it is very possible in both frameworks to later implement a simple touch forwarding system that can actually eliminate that specific requirement.  UIViews will remain important in some capacity because they are the main way to support accessibility and a few other features.

58,2014-10-19 20:43:31,"A regular view gets retained as soon as it is passed to `addSubview:`. But if we were to rely on the onOrder events, a node would only be retained properly when `addSubview:` is called _on a hierarchy that is already visible_.

For instance, the unit test `testAddingNodeToHierarchyRetainsNode` would not pass anymore.

Typically, such operations happen in a view controller's `viewDidLoad` method, where `self.view` is not attached to any window yet. Any node that is not retained would end up being deallocated right at the end of the method, before it even receives the onOrderIn event. 

Also, there are other cases where view/layer hierarchies are moved in and out of windows. For example, presenting a fullscreen view controller causes the onOrderOut event to be sent to the whole hierarchy that gets hidden beneath. This would cause the keepalive reference to be released.

I don't know enough about CA internals to come up with other ideas here, except intercepting all calls to `-[CALayer addSublayer:]` (yuck). Then there's the simpler option of requiring all nodes to be retained as long as they are used in a hierarchy.

@darknoon I don't think the onOrder events are triggered for changes to the `hidden` property. (Seems the [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CALayer_class/) is wrong about this.

> We'd be interested in hearing your use case and whether the cells are changing positions frequently or you're scrolling through a mostly static feed of cells. 

In my case, I don't care so much for changing the position (I'm assuming you're talking about indexPath) of cells once they've been laid out. I'm more interested in being able to provide custom layouts (specifically, horizontal) and the ability to have variable-sized cells in that layout. Some equivalent of `layoutAttributesForElementInRect:`, `layoutAttributesForItemAtIndexPath:`, and `
targetContentOffsetForProposedContentOffset:` would be great as well as those would let me do a few interesting things to a horizontal layout. A collectionView layout that looks like the Paper strip, but allows for items of different heights (center-aligned) would be a good example of what would meet my needs. 

As a side note, probably my favorite feature of AsyncDisplayKit is that nodes calculate their own sizes. I've been working on enabling iOS8 self-sizing cells into my existing UICollectionViews and UITableViews, and those features seem to be tremendously buggy right now ([first](https://github.com/rainypixels/SelfSizingCells) of three radars I have on my list to file).

41,2014-10-15 04:14:04,"@RCacheaux - This makes sense for completeness, but honestly I haven't thought through the correct behavior of preventOrCancelDisplay in this scenario.

Imagine you have a precompositing node that has preventOrCancelDisplay == NO, and only some of its subnodes have it set to YES.  When the precompositing node needs to display, should the software compositing simply skip over any nodes marked YES?  This would be pretty odd, but it probably makes the most sense if someone actually does do that with the framework.  However I'm sure it wouldn't work that way currently.

Let me know what you would expect from the framework in this scenario.  I assume you ran into this while testing precompositing, and any other feedback or bug reports about it would be much appreciated!  This feature is used in Paper, but it does not have as broad a number of use cases as the rest of the framework, so there are likely corner cases such as this that would be really valuable to us to clean up.
",appleguy,RCacheaux
41,2014-10-15 14:08:14,"@appleguy I agree that it would be odd to have some subnodes of a precompositing node with preventOrCancelDisplay == YES while the rasterization container is set to NO. Ideally, I think that the entire node hierarchy under a rasterization container should either have preventOrCancelDisplay set to YES or NO. I suppose recursiveSetPreventOrCancelDisplay could assert that the initial node called is not a subnode of a rasterization container. Additionally, setting preventOrCancelDisplay could also assert on rasterization container subnodes. Those are my initial thoughts.

The use case that brought this to light is a rasterized node hierarchy in which one of the subnodes is an image node that uses the image modification block to apply a blur using Accelerate. The blur operation takes a while on older hardware so I build in a cancelation mechanism that checks preventOrCancelDisplay on the image node. I was calling recursiveSetPreventOrCancelDisplay on the root node expecting it to set its children to YES so that the blur operation would pick up the cancellation.

3219,2017-03-24 20:45:52,"I'd like to share my vision of ASCollectionNode, now that we have #3017 and #3130 in pretty good shape to form a foundation of the following projects:
1. Give back control to collection layout objects and eliminate layout inspector, layout facilitator, etc.
2. Have `ASDataController`, `ASRangeController` and `ASCollectionLayout`s to be decoupled from `ASCollectionView` and instead rely on `ASCollectionNode`. With this, we'll be able to do the initial `reloadData`, prepare collection layout and preload cells before the view is even allocated.
3. Introduce measure range (and even allocate range in the far future): `ASDataController` won't allocate and measure all cell nodes in one go, but instead delegate to its layout delegate, such as `ASCollection(Gallery|Pager)FlowLayout` (#2979).
4. Interface-state-aware `ASCollectionNode`:
    - When a collection node enters preload state, it triggers the initial `reloadData` and then preloads ""visible"" cells. Those cells should be in preload state and start fetching images, etc. A collection node that is in preload state should have its own visible range of 0, display range of 0 and preload range of 1.
    - When it enters display state, it allocates its collection view and renders. Its visible range at this stage is 0, render range is 1 and preload range is bigger than that.
   - When it finally enters visible range, its visible cells should all be ready and it uses the normal ranges.
   - With this system, nest collection nodes (e.g closeup) will be much better supported. Currently we can't perform initial `reloadData`, prepare the collection layouts and preload visible cells (e.g pin image) of sub-collection-cell-nodes (e.g close gallery cell) until they enter display range of the containing collection (e.g closeup gallery pager) and have their view allocated.

3190,2017-03-16 09:52:28,"Hi guys,

Following #3112 I'm submitting this PR to solve the bridging crashes I was experiencing when implementing `ASImageCacheProtocol` in Swift.
A sample project showcasing the problem can be found here: https://github.com/flovouin/ASDK-ASImageCacheProtocolBridge
The problem is that `clearFetchedImageFromCacheWithURL` is sometimes called with a `nil` URL when it shouldn't.

So I double checked all the calls to `ASImageCacheProtocol` and `ASImageDownloaderProtocol` in the ASDK codebase and came up with the following PR.

- The first commit ensures that the image nodes never call the image protocols methods with a `nil` URL / identifier when they shouldn't. The only place where I am not entirely sure whether the URL can be `nil` is in the [ASNetworkImageNode](https://github.com/flovouin/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/d1e7759e7835521b2b1b9b00a9fae7bea7a70185/Source/ASNetworkImageNode.mm#L505). It would seem that `_downloadImageWithCompletion` is only called if `_URL != nil`, but as there's some multi thread funkyness happening, I'm not sure it is safe to assume. If someone who has more experience than me could review this part, that'd be nice :-)
- The second commit removes unnecessary checks for `nil` identifiers in image downloaders, as they are declared as `nonnull` in the protocol definitions.

@maicki was suggesting in #3112 to have `synchronouslyFetchedCachedImageWithURL` accept a `nullable` URL, which is actually already the case, although I'm not sure it really makes sense: why would you ask for the resource corresponding to a `nil` URL, especially if you already know the result? Also, this method is currently only called with a (explicitly checked) non-nil URL in the codebase. Finally, its documentation seems outdated as it references a `completion` block that does not exist in the method prototype. However I did not amend it for the time being, please tell me if you want me to do so :-) I personally would be in favour of making the URL argument `nonnull`.

This PR solves the crashes demonstrated by the sample project, but I'm willing to make more changes if you have any remarks!

* We have two sources of truth. One is the asset within the `ASVideoPlayerNode` and the other one is within the backing `ASVideoNode`. Ideally we only want to have only one final source of truth, therefore this PR will try to use the `ASVideoNode` as final truth of source.
* `_loadAssetWhenNodeBecomesVisible` isn't turned on in the empty initializer. This causes an assertion in #3042 because it's not safe to set an asset on ASVideoNode off main.
* The flag itself is troublesome. It's enabled by default, but even so, ""visible"" is a bit too late. The asset can be loaded as soon as the player enters preload state, which is what ASVideoNode is doing.

- Removed ASLegacyCollectionLayoutCalculator and let ASDataController run a slightly different code path if a calculator is not provided.
- Removed ASCollectionLayoutSpecCalculator.
- Calculators now return a new `ASCollectionLayout` object that contains a content size and an element to rect table. Layout attributes will be created on the fly.

A few things left that I need time to think about:
- Node allocation API that allows layout/layout calculator to decide which nodes to allocate.
- ASCollectionLayoutContext object. For simplicity of the first version, let's not add `-setFrame:forElement:` and `-isCancelled`.
- Supplementary elements: Ideally I want the calculator to only care about laying out elements given to it. Maybe we should introduce a new object, say `ASCollectionSupplementaryProvider` that creates all supplementaries needed for a given set of items?

I think it's a good idea as it forbids people from accessing the collection view directly. In addition, I'd like to leave an option to subclass `ASCollectionLayout` directly.

3127,2017-03-21 13:57:30,"Hey guys,

So currently I've simply solved the problem by adding the following logic to `shouldBatchFetch`:



- `isScrollingUp` is necessary even though the check already exists in the current `ASDisplayShouldFetchBatchForContext` implementation because it is bypassed when `hasSmallContent` is `YES` (the second case of my original issue). This could simply be solved by moving the `isScrollingTowardHead` check above the small content check.
- `isBouncingAtTop` is also pretty much self-explanatory and solves the first case of the original issue. This could be added to ASDK's logic, although the `contentInset` should be forwarded to `ASDisplayShouldFetchBatchForContext`.

It shouldn't be too hard to add this in `ASDisplayShouldFetchBatchForContext`, and I feel that it would be at its place in the batch fetching logic.

3125,2017-03-02 05:49:32,"This was added in #430. Since then it's grown and grown in complexity probably due to other issues encountered along the way. 😱 

Back then we would flush the range controller (queued in the run loop), and now we synchronously flush it (if it's invalidated):

- At the end of the layout pass
- After calling endUpdates
- When we enter the window

The original rationale was that ""we depend on -indexPathsForVisibleRows to be correct immediately after willDisplayCell:, but it isn't."" But I don't think it's true that we depend on it being correct at that time… we depend on it being correct later, asynchronously. Could be interesting to see if `indexPathsForVisibleRows` calls `layoutIfNeeded` or equivalent.

@eanagel What are your thoughts on this? You mentioned that not having it caused issues with programmatic scrolling – do I need to do anything specific to repro?",Adlai-Holler,eanagel
3125,2017-03-03 04:47:50,"TL;DR - Yeah I think you can get rid of this code now.

The original issue was that we expected the newly visible cell to already be in `-indexPathsForVisibleRows` during the call to `-willDisplayCell:forRowAtIndexPath:` which is almost always true, except in certain cases when scrolling programmatically. When I would see this, cells would render as blank when scrolling programmatically. It wouldn't always happen but once a cell was missed it would be blank as long as it was on screen. 

It looks like ASRangeController now delays it's updates to the next run loop. I think this would handle that edge case. And from what I can tell in this code (it's pretty complex) if it wasn't visible at that point we would eventually get it.

@appleguy As an aside we are currently testing code that allows to move to ASCollectionNode instead of ASTableNode. This is due to an amazing custom layout that @master-nevi has put together that performs virtualization without requiring changes to ASCollectionNode/View its self. (By Virtualization I mean that inserts or deletes outside the visible window don't cause any visible change to the user. To do this we adjust the content offset so the visible window doesn't change as it naturally would with a collection or table view.)",eanagel,appleguy

@nguyenhuy Fortunately this can be reproduced right away with examples/CustomCollectionView.  I suggest you have my PR applied just to make sure you don't hit the unnecessary assertions at a stage earlier than the actual crash: (this is now in master, so just pull to latest) https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/3079

The attached .txt has some debug logs that I found helpful.  Here's the issue:

- The data source is queried correctly, and does return supplementary nodes for everything that it should.
- These are put into an ASMutableElementMap and I believe this does make it to _pendingMap (but it's a bit hard to tell since it is copied)
- However, at the time of the crash, the _visibleMap object that is being queried by UIKit does not have _any_ supplementary elements in it...even though we've reported that some exist to UIKit.

I think it is possible that the async sizing pass for the cells somehow doesn't gate the collection becoming aware of the supplementary nodes earlier, before the sizing pass is done.

@nguyenhuy @Adlai-Holler thank you so much for all the work on ASDataController!  It is very architecturally impressive, and truly represents a successful new era of one of the most crucial components in the framework.  These bugs are likely to be small fixes.

3008,2017-02-09 22:13:00,"## Overview

`ASTextNode` is currently hardcoded to use `ASLayoutManager` as its layout manager for drawing. Allowing users to provide a custom layout manager to `ASTextNode` would provide a lot of power in terms of custom drawing and what `ASTextNode` can achieve for people.

## Why Use a Custom Layout Manager

As `NSLayoutManager` is really the meat and potatoes of the TextKit stack and controls drawing, subclassing it allows for easy tweaking of how things are drawn, and allows you to perform additional drawing steps.

In my case, I render Markdown into cells. Markdown has a lot of styling that purely using `NSAttributedString` doesn't allow you to accomplish, things you can see easily with GitHub's Markdown, such as quotes:

> ← `NSAttributedString` doesn't have an attribute to draw lines on the side

Or even just `inline code`, where `NSBackgroundStyleAttributeName` falls short in allowing you to do things such as round the squared off rectangle, add a border, padding, etc.

Subclassing `NSLayoutManager` allows you to do all this quite easily, and to my understanding without creating any issues with AsyncDisplayKit if this capability is introduced properly. For instance, subclassing and overriding `fillBackgroundRectArray(_:count:forCharacterRange:color:)` allows you to easily round the rectangles drawn with `NSBackgroundStyleAttributeName`, and further drawing can be done in `drawGlyphs(forGlyphRange:at:)`. 

## Example

**Example Project:** [TestCustomLayoutManager.zip](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/files/765018/TestCustomLayoutManager.zip)

As I said, I render Markdown in my app. Subclassing `NSLayoutManager` allows me to add lines on the side of quotes, introduce inline code formatting, and show horizontal rules (`<hr>`s), among other things by simply adding an extra attribute onto the `NSAttributedString`, as shown in a simple example in the example project.

*Image showing line-intended-blockquote, inline code and horizontal rule in `ASTextNode` from subclassing `NSLayoutManager`*

Which simply required the following subclass (truncated):

`

## How to Do It

My proposed solution is to allow `ASTextNode` to be provided with an `NSLayoutManager` *class* at init time, eg: `[[ASTextNode alloc] initWithLayoutManagerClass:[MyLayoutManager class]]`.

The advantage of this way is that it makes it really hard to shoot yourself in the foot. Talking with some people like @appleguy and @maicki among others in Slack who know infinitely more about ASDK than I do, they've mentioned this functionality has been there in the past but caused some issues with the layout manager being mutable after the fact. By only passing the subclass (akin to `NSPersistentStoreCoordinator`'s `registerStoreClass(_:forStoreType:)` model) and creating it at the end only when needed, issues with people changing it after the fact, or holding a reference to it are obviated.

Other methods such as passing in an actual `NSLayoutManager` object at init, or passing in a block are viable too, but would only provide the capability to tweak it slightly initially, which I'm not sure would have much use (especially to be worth the cost of complicating it further).

@appleguy mentioned some other awesome options in how to tackle this, such as using composition to have separate `ASDisplayNodes` behind the `ASTextNode` that operate as the rounded rects and whatnot, but I think `NSLayoutManager` overall adds a simpler, easy-to-point-to place to perform custom text drawing such as that. And furthermore, if people come to AsyncDisplayKit with existing TextKit stacks and custom `NSLayoutManager`s (*-waves-* that's me) it would make it really easy to integrate your existing work and get up and running with ASDK quickly.

Hope I did this right! @maicki mentioned it would be a good idea to put this up as a point of discussion and see what people think, so that's exactly what I'm doing. Would love to hear what all you brilliant folk think.",christianselig,appleguy

From @rcancro:

> I have a question surrounding ASTableNode, its data controller and when _completedNodes in the data controller is populated. On iPad when we bring up the save dialog and tap on ""New Board” we push a new VC onto the modal’s nav controller. The nav controller (since it is in a modal on iPad) has a width of 520. However, the VC doesn’t realize this until `viewWillAppear`. I’m seeing the following happen:
> 1. The VC is created with a width of 768
> 2. The VC’s tableNode creates its cells with a 768 width (I can put a breakpoint in the `nodeBlockForRowAtIndexPath` and see it being hit)
> 3. The VC gets resized to 520. This causes `asyncTraitCollectionDidChange` to be called on the table node
> 4. In `asyncTraitCollectionDidChange` the tableNode asks for its completed nodes via `[self.view.dataController completedNodes]` so it can propagate the new container size. However, `[self.view.dataController completedNodes]` returns an empty array.

This method offers compatibility with synchronous, standard UICollectionViewCell objects. These cells will **not** have the performance benefits of ASCellNodes (like preloading, async layout, and async drawing) - even when mixed within the same ASCollectionNode.

In order to use this method, you must:
1. Implement it on your ASCollectionDataSource object.
2. Call registerCellClass: on the collectionNode.view (in viewDidLoad, or register an onDidLoad: block).
3. Return nil from the nodeBlockForItem...: or nodeForItem...: method. NOTE: it is an error to return nil from within a nodeBlock, if you have returned a nodeBlock object.
4. Lastly, you must implement a method to provide the size for the cell. There are two ways this is done:
4a. UICollectionViewFlowLayout (incl. ASPagerNode). Implement collectionNode:constrainedSizeForItemAtIndexPath:.
4b. Custom collection layouts. Set .view.layoutInspector and have it implement collectionView:constrainedSizeForNodeAtIndexPath:.

`ASCellNode` is always preferred. However, for code bases that have hundreds or more custom `UICollectionViewCells` subclasses, this feature will allow them to port to ASDK more easily, and then slowly convert their backlog of cells to be `ASCellNode` subclasses. 

This change allows mixing both those un-ported `UICollectionViewCell`s and `ASCellNode`s without a performance penalty for the `UIKitCells`. In addition, it still provides of `ASCellNode`, including automatic preload, asynchronous measurement and asynchronous rendering. Because of this difference in performance, app developers will clearly see the value of porting cells to `ASCellNode` and be able to do so over time.

I asked @maicki about this and he said that this is expected behavior, although we could definitely improve our documentation around this. 

`ASLayoutSpec` is essentially an abstract class, _except_ for its one use as a flexible spacer (when used with no children). If you want to use `ASLayoutSpec`, you'll need to subclass it and implement a few methods (see any of the other layout specs for an example of that. 

If you just need to return a single node from your `-layoutSpecThatFits:` method, then use `ASWrapperLayoutSpec` as you did.  ",hannahmbanana,maicki

2916,2017-01-20 03:16:44,"This year I'd like to achieve some _significant_ refactoring to our data controller class cluster. It is a crucial piece of our architecture, and there's a lot that we can improve about it:

This first task is to remove `ASChangeSetDataController`. Currently, this class receives calls like `insertItemsAtIndexPaths:` and `deleteItemsAtIndexPaths:` etc and buffers them into an `_ASHierarchyChangeSet` (does not call super). Then, during `endUpdates`, it reads all the changes out of the hierarchy change set and makes the same insert/delete calls, _in safe order_ up to its parent `ASDataController`. 

This causes a number of headaches, because:
- It obscures what's really going on when you update a collection: you _transmit_ a changeset across a bunch of calls, and then you actually commit it in `-endUpdates`. So once they commit the change, we should forget all about the big stream of `reload/insert/delete` calls and think of it as just one change that we need to process.
- `ASDataController` has no context around the editing calls it receives. It just gets a stream of insert/delete calls during `endUpdates`, and for each one we switch queues and do all this stuff.
- Since it lacks context, its power is really limited, which is bad because it's an important class.
- It's very weird for a subclass to suppress, and then reorder, and then submit `super` calls for the calls it receives. It makes it tricky to nail down just what each method means!

So let's remove it, and add a single editing method to `ASDataController` like `updateWithChangeSet:`, and have `ASCollectionDataController` inherit directly from `ASDataController`. In the future we'll combine `ASCollectionDataController` and `ASDataController` since they duplicate so much functionality.

I've pushed a branch `SimplifyDataController` that is partially complete, but I'm swamped with work right now so if @nguyenhuy you would be willing to commandeer it I would appreciate it.",Adlai-Holler,nguyenhuy

In general, the Layout Transition API is designed to transition between two layout trees.

2848,2016-12-31 00:13:06,"I'm excited to announce that I've been working on this, and I think it's ready for beta testing. 

IGListKit is a great framework and this, if landed, would supersede #2566. It's true that IGListKit doesn't support table views, but the benefits outweigh that cost I believe.

- Adds a new header, `ASCollectionNode+ListKitBeta.h` containing the public API for the integration.
  - New property, `ASCollectionNode.listAdapter`. Set this to a list adapter to get IGListKit going.
- Updates the `ASDKgram` example to have a new tab that uses ASDK+IGListKit.
- Adds a new workspace containing a few basic tests for ASDK+IGListKit. More to come here.
  - New workspace is necessary because otherwise the ASDK build in the main workspace will have to always link IGListKit. I tried a bunch of approaches for keeping it all inside one workspace but trust me, they all sucked.
- Adds a new subspec `IGListKit` to the podspec.
- Adds a new mode to `build.sh` to run the ListKit tests.

### To Make it Work

Users should have their section controller conform to `ASIGListSectionType` rather than just plain `IGListSectionType` (our protocol inherits from theirs) and add `ASIGSectionControllerCellForIndexImplementation` and `ASIGSectionControllerSizeForItemImplementation` into their section controllers, and then implement `constrainedSizeForItemAtIndex:` (optionally) and `nodeBlockForItemAtIndex:`.

### Hacks

- IGListKit has a trivial subclass of UICollectionView called `IGListCollectionView` that is subclassing-restricted. They assert that you use that class. So we use the (evil) function `class_setSuperclass(ASCollectionView, IGListCollectionView)` when you link IGListKit so that we inherit from it. If they would be willing to remove the subclass restriction, we could conditionally compile the `@interface` to inherit from the one we want.",Adlai-Holler,interface

2847,2017-01-02 03:03:08,"@maicki I just saw your comment and want to make sure it is resolved before merging this!

Regarding the layout, the expected behavior since early ASDK has been that the ASCellNode is a subnode of the .contentView of the cell, and matches its frame.  This means that if an accessoryView is shown, the size of the cell would be reduced, just as is the case for any UIKit code putting things in the .contentView.

The current code looks to still include this behavior, where the width of the contentView is treated essentially as a constrained size.  See screenshot below.

In terms of testing, what did you have in mind?  From a technical perspective, how could this be tested?  Saif is very new to ASDK, so I don't think he would be able to do a new snapshot test from scratch, but maybe you know of some existing test that we could either duplicate and add it to or include it as part of?

2837,2016-12-25 23:37:57,"This has become one of the most commonly-asked questions on Slack.  In addition to the benefit from having a simple answer / documentation callout for the feature, the complexity is low enough to provide this kind of BOOL.  The use case common enough — all comment / messaging views — that it makes sense to do if we can implement it with ~20 lines of code or less.

All this option would do:
- Provide BOOL on Table or Collection
- When enabled, it flips 180º every ASCellNode that is returned (by applying a transform to it.  It also sets its own transform to flip 180º.
- That's it!  It would be reasonable to assert / not allow changing the property after content has started to load (or even, when the node's view exists).  The 90% value is captured in this case.  Any more dynamic cases should be handled by apps directly.

> yeah, that's why I mentioned that you can rely on it for the first load, but not after that .  There isn't support for fetching from the other direction right now.  I think we may have a task filed, but because the team has many high priority work areas for the next 3 months, we're not likely to implement it for the next major feature release (2.1).  However, we'd welcome any PRs that extend the ASBatchFetching system to include a Head fetch type / context.  There are some docs on the website that explain the existing system and it should be easy to speculate how it could be extended.

Yes, that is right ([code here](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/AsyncDisplayKit/Private/ASStackUnpositionedLayout.mm)). But in this case the separator is the longest element because of the above new behavior. It's longer than the 2 buttons.

2784,2016-12-18 08:36:02,"@garrettmoon is there a lower-level way to do this?  E.g. How does ASDelegateProxy work in these cases without having to manually forward those methods?  I'm going to merge since @maicki already approved, but let me know your thoughts!",appleguy,maicki
2782,2016-12-15 21:24:06,@maicki definitely want your feedback on this.,garrettmoon,maicki
2782,2016-12-19 04:41:03,"Here's my feedback, although I don't intend for it to be definitive — I'm interested in understanding what behavior @maicki would prefer we support.

## 1. The internal complexity of ASNetworkImageNode
- Is important to consider and aim to reduce.  However, I believe it is *essential* that internal complexity not be a factor in the API design.  The reason is that there are sufficiently many clients of ASDK (over 1,000 developers regularly interacting with it), so that some increase in internal complexity would suggest we should invest in a refactor rather than affect the API.

## 2. There are exactly 3 cases to consider ASNetworkImageNode with:

Note that in the last case (both are set), we *must* provide *identical behavior* regardless of call order — therefore, regardless of implementation complexity, the decision on API behavior is only for the ""both"" case and doesn't care about the order.

### a. Just .URL
This behavior is simple.  It should not change from the prior implementation.  If externally *read*, the .image property will become set after the URL has loaded.  Likewise, the rendered version will be cleared when exiting the Display range, and the .image property itself will be cleared existing the Preload range.

### b. Just .image
This behavior is also simple, but doesn't work correctly in 2.0.  When just the .image is set and .URL is *never* set, the class should behave like ASImageNode.  Why?  Several reasons:

- many, many clients (including all over Pinterest) have already relied on this behavior.  That's because it's intuitive and very frequently convenient for app developers.
- the convenience for devs is highlighted by the case of PIImageNode.  It would be very difficult if we had to create a separate subclass and ensure even brand-new developers *always* use the base vs network class in the right situation.
- It would also make it more difficult for us to add features internally.  E.g., a network-loaded button background, or even the future ASVideoNode that doesn't subclass ASImageNode — they would each have to carefully manage a Network vs Non-Network node to support both the direct-set asset / thumbnail as well as the URL-based option.

### c. Both .URL and .image.
The case of BOTH .URL and .image set is less clear.  However, the case is clarified by seeing there are only two reasons a user would do this:

- they want to load the URL image but are providing a cached or smaller version of the image to ""prime"" the view,
- the code is incorrect and inconsistent.  I don't believe there is a use case where the .image should take precedence over the .URL, especially because there are memory risks to doing this (ASDK can't yield the memory, so it should only ever be used with small icon-like assets and these almost never have .URLs)

So lastly, this diff is a suggestion from @garrettmoon for how to make 2c. less ambiguous while still being VERY strict at preventing developers from mistakenly entering the ""2c2"" case.  The idea is that this will behave functionally identical to ""it's not allowed to set both URL and .image on a Network node"", *but* provide users *a technically-possible way* to support the commonly-useful pattern of ""priming"" a network image node.

## 3. To make this call (which would increase impl. complexity), let's look at the use case
What's causing this to be so important?  It's transitions that upscale photos, including the exact case @rcancro is working on right now with Pin Closeup's standard zoom-in.

Por these, it is *essential* to support upscaling a low-res photo *while immediately kicking off a new high-res download,* as well as *async-displaying the new version*, as well as *swapping in the high-res version as soon as it's done, in a seamless way*.  This behavior is super useful because it is so hard to handle at an application layer.

This was a very, very key use case that AsyncDisplayKit was architected to excel at in the pre-1.0 days, with ASMultiplexImageNode bearing the complexity of the use case.  However, Multiplex has fallen into non-maintenance, and so we have two paths to choose at this point:

- Let Multiplex continue to fade away, and probably become deprecated (e.g. we don't need to spend any time on it).  Support basic transition use case with something like ""ephemeralImage"", or simply using the .image + .URL combination as a simple implementation for this.
- Alternatively, plan to revive Multiplex and refactor it to share more code with Network.  Simplify Multiplex API so the ""common transition"" use case can be done more easily than the current dataSource-based API.  Keep NetworkImage as simple as possible and do not allow transitions to be performed with it.

Thanks for reading a long note, hope this was useful to the discussion :)",appleguy,rcancro
2777,2016-12-15 16:27:53,"@EviluS Thanks. I'm thinking of making it a little more seamless, since this really does sound like something more than I alone will use. As @appleguy mentioned in his talks, `ASKD` is now going beyond just providing performance, but also convenience for framework users.

Looking through ASEditableTextNode.mm, I'm thinking of extending `ASTextKitComponents` with something like:



Using `layoutManager.lineFragmentRect` to loop through and find the line fragmentRect that corresponds to the maxLine. That should give me a more accurate height than using a fixed font's point height. Especially since I'm expecting mixed fonts, use of Emojis, Chinese Characters, paragraph styles, etc.

Anyway, with that in place, I can modify ASEditableTextNode's `- (CGSize)calculateSizeThatFits:(CGSize)constrainedSize` to calculate the height using the existing method if `maximumLinesToDisplay = 0` or the above if `maximumLinesToDisplay != 0`.

Anyway, the only issue I have is that I'm absolutely not familiar with Objective-C. It generally makes my eyes glaze over 😝 . If this was Swift, then I'd be able to try this out right away. Haha. So now, I'm going to wait on my friend who's more Objective-C literate to help me out tomorrow (HKT). 😉

2773,2016-12-19 04:49:02,"Regarding crash vs assertion.  I think we need to develop a better way to log assertions in production, but I disagree they should be crashes by default.  IMO we should develop a new macro for this case and offer two things to app developers:

- A #define switch to turn these special types of logs into hard crashes in production (off by default)
- An override where they can log nonfatal, e.g. with Fabric, so that the logs are still visible and problems are discovered in production.  This could be registering a block, like +[ASDisplayNode setNonfatalHandlerBlock:] or something.

I think this is fairly important as a default, because the vast majority of these cases happen with newly-developed code and have a relatively minor problem when the frame is not set.  In most cases, teams (at any company) would prefer to get /some/ experiment data rather than have to hotfix the app to stop crashes or get initial data collection.

2705,2016-12-02 23:33:18,"Worked with @binl and @maicki on this – if a node has a `_pendingDisplayNodeLayout`, that layout will take precedence over the one calculated by this method, while the node waits for UIKit to run a layout pass on it.

However, in the case of a collection/table, UIKit may not run a layout pass for a long time and so it's important that we invalidate that pending layout when we remeasure the node. For example, when rotating, if a node has a pending layout designed for portrait and we rotate to landscape, we need to immediately discard the pending portrait layout.",Adlai-Holler,binl

2694,2016-12-06 00:29:46,"@maicki to @nguyenhuy 's point -- I think it is true this may extend node lifecycle, and we should at least schedule another 2.0.1 task to address that.

One strategy would be to schedule a runloop queue item to clear the pointer to the ASLayout, if by the time the queue item runs, it still should be cleared.  This is similar to how we call didExitDisplayState (clearContents) on NON-range managed nodes -- we schedule it the moment they're removed from the parent, but we re-check once the block runs, and sometimes they've re-entered a new parent by that time so we skip the clearing.

That said, the main concern would be ultra high volumes of block dispatches and retain / release if this happened on every node.  So as long as we make sure that, in practice, it doesn't occur when a full node hierarchy is being destroyed (e.g. the parent of a large tree is released) -- and we have some way to detect this case (e.g. ""removeSupernodeDueToDyingParent"" - and not schedule the cleanup in that path)...then it should be a good solution for the more rare, manual removeFromSupernode calls.",appleguy,nguyenhuy

2682,2016-11-30 00:25:37,"Resolves #2252 

This is one _very strange_ edge case and huge props to @tomizimobile for providing a reliable repro. I distilled the repro down into a unit test and found the problem.

In `grouped` style with section headers and footers, table views will sometimes return more index paths than necessary from `indexPathsForVisibleRows`. We knew this, but considered the risk acceptable. The risk isn't really acceptable – if we mark a node as `visible` we are relying on the fact that it is hosted in an actual cell, so that if the range controller doesn't mark the node invisible before it is removed (say, the item is deleted from the collection or the collection is deallocated) the code in `ASDisplayNode.didExitHierarchy` will retain the node and clear the visible bit before deallocating.

Added a failing unit test and modified the table view visible index paths method to account for this case. Ready for review!",Adlai-Holler,tomizimobile
2680,2016-11-30 17:48:42,I know that the 2.0 launch is resource-intensive so @garrettmoon how should we move forward with this?,Adlai-Holler,garrettmoon
2679,2016-12-01 12:05:28,"Thanks for the response. I am currently not using 2.0 because it is still in beta, we are close to release the app so i was sticking to old version.
For now I have resolved the issue by using reload instead of reloading section

2675,2016-11-29 01:04:25,"- Add a (previously-failing) unit test that when the content starts off not filling the screen, and then a batch fetch is issued that results in the new content filling the screen, we do not start another batch fetch.
- Remove `didCompleteUpdatesInRangeController:`
  - This required callback is to inform ASCollectionView/ASTableView that the range controller has updated the ranges of visible nodes.
  - Its name is easily confused with `rangeController:didEndUpdatesAnimated:completion:`
  - It was previously used to schedule a batch fetch check when the ranges were updated.
  - Batch fetching here has two issues:
    - It doesn't really make sense. The range controller updating the interface state of nodes has no impact on whether it is appropriate to batch fetch or not.
    - It may cause batch fetches to be issued at bad times. When we issue an update to UICollectionView, if the update caused the visible cells to change, then we synchronously update the range controller (in order to make our API guarantees about visibility). However, UICollectionView does not immediately update its `contentSize` and so we may _think_ we're still near the end, when in reality a new batch of content has just arrived and we do not need to fetch again.
- Pass `self.scrollDirection` for the `scrollDirection` param, rather than passing `self.scrollableDirections` (!!) 
- Add a new `scrollableDirections` arg to the batch checking algorithm, so that even if the user is not scrolling (content-not-filling-bounds case) we can still use the correct axes when computing e.g. ""total length.""
- Update the batch fetching algorithm to use `CGRectIsEmpty` rather than comparing the rect to zero. It is common for UICollectionView to have e.g. `(0, -64, 0, 0)` early in its lifecycle due to contentInset.
- Update batch checking algorithm to correctly issue a batch update in the small-content case even if not scrolling.
  - This was previously working due to us passing `self.scrollableDirections` rather than `self.scrollDirection`. Two wrongs made a right in this isolated case 😛 .
- Update the prior unit tests to be compatible with the new code.

Especially around sizing and layout, we work against UIKit instead of working with UIKit.

### Changes
- We should change from having the view of the display node as ASViewController.view to add the node as subview to the ASViewController.view
- Stretch the node always the full size of the ASViewController.view in the layout pass
- Remove `nodeConstrainedSize`

### Open Questions
- `ASViewController` containment: Big question mark and that's the reason why we have this PR still in development stage is the handling of view controller containment. A good example is within here: https://gist.github.com/maicki/45a33341af35d6a04dbb8df7db13f42e .

> @flo I'd need to learn a bit more about what you're trying to do - may be helpful to hear concretely what you're doing to transform the URL to tell what could support it.  I'd recommend looking for -didEnterPreloadState (using 2.0-beta.1 or master) and at that time, generate the URL.  Basically use a custom subclass of ASNetworkImageNode, set your ""sourceURL"" on it, and then have the conversion to the ""true"" URL happen at a stage earlier — then set the actual .URL property to the correct URL.  If it isn't too expensive to do the conversions then definitely just do them at node init time instead, but doing them at Preload time will result in only the minimum number of URLs being converted (same number as will actually be fetched) so this should work

1. Should we propagate style for all specs that have only one child – inset, ratio, center, relative?

Can you think of a simple way to artificially boost drawingPriority for these nodes?  Can we add ~10 to the priority at the point that the priority is checked, or add to it in the getter method of each node if they're able to efficiently check that a synchronous display is ongoing?

2574,2016-11-08 07:53:05,"@garrettmoon - this could be related to / the same as the PINRemoteImage issue, https://github.com/pinterest/PINRemoteImage/issues/260?

@boreys thank you for reporting this!  If you believe this issue is most likely related to PINRemoteImage internal behavior, rather than the way AsyncDisplayKit drives it, let's move the discussion to that project.  Does it sound like the same issue to you?  If you could read back on the thread, we'd be grateful for any similar details on the case you discovered.

This is the most important image-related issue we're tracking right now, as we just heard about it a few days ago.  We'll prioritize getting it fixed as soon as we have a lead on what might be causing it, and ideally we can force it to reproduce by using network link conditioner, manually crash app while saving, etc.

If you need to perform multiple operations (such as a delete and insert, or any other combination), you should wrap them in a performBatchUpdates: call.

2566,2016-11-07 23:31:04,"UICollectionView/UITableView API is a pain to work with. Does the message `Invalid number of items in section 0. The number of items in an existing section after the update (10) must be equal to the number of items before the update (6), plus or minus the number inserted or deleted (3 inserted, 0 deleted)` look familiar?

### What it Looks Like

#### Before:



#### After:



#### How it Works

If the data source implements the new method, all imperative updates are ignored. Whenever an update is submitted, the method is called. It retrieves a data object that contains all of the existing items and sections in the collection node, by identifier. It configures the data set how it wants it, we do a nested diff against the old data, and we update if needed.

#### Performance Considerations

- The diffing algorithm in this diff has been vastly optimized. I scrolled down through Pinterest's home feed a long way (30 seconds' worth) on my iPhone 6. Using the original diffing implementation, it spent about 1100ms diffing. After my optimizations, the number was around 33ms, which was small compared to the amount of time spent in UIKit machinery. 
- If the user adds an item with an identifier that already existed, then no allocations occur. If they provide the nodeBlock argument inline, then no `Block_copy` happens either. I've added documentation indicating that you will get somewhat improved performance by specifying the node block inline, rather than calling `[self nodeBlockForItemAtRow:]` or similar.
- Users may generate their identifiers lazily i.e. `[NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@.%@"", model.class, model.identifier]`. This is unfortunate, but acceptable – string allocations are crazy fast. For cases with extremely high item counts and extremely common updates, we can advise users to store their identifiers, which really isn't hard.
- In the future, we might do some or all of the diffing asynchronously, but the cost-benefit doesn't justify that at this time.
  - We would have to be sure to wait for the update to complete if the user called `nodeForItemAtIndexPath:` or `numberOfItemsInSection` or `indexPathForNode:` or really any ASCollectionNode API.
  - We should call `dataForCollectionNode:` on the main thread because users are going to use main-thread-affine view controller flags, and their upstream data sources are main-thread-affine as well.

### Further Considerations

- How should a user trigger an update?
  - Option 1: Calling `reloadData` or ending a batch update always triggers the incremental update.
  - Option 2: A new method e.g. `performUpdateWithCompletion:` triggers the incremental update, and `reloadData` always invalidates everything.
  - Advocacy: Option 1.
    - Users are trained to throw `reloadData` when they aren't sure how to commit an update.
    - I can't think of a use case for ""throw away all the nodes that exists for all the identifiers and then reload."" I'm sure one exists out there, but this could be achieved by another means (see below).
- How should a user indicate they want to invalidate the existing node for a given identifier/section?
  - Consider the use case: a user taps on a pin, and now we want to change that pin to be represented by a different class of node.
  - If this method exists, it should live on the collection node itself, not on the data. They should be able to call it inside of `dataForCollectionNode:` as well as in arbitrary regions of their code , which might be slightly tricky.
  - Option 1: They can't. If you want to get a new node, change the identifier.
  - Option 2: Add a method like `invalidateElementWithIdentifier:` to ASCollectionNode that will pipe the invalidation through to both the current data, and to the data that is currently being configured.
- How should we gather the constrained size? What if they give us a different constrained size for an already-measured node?
  - I believe the correct solution is for the layout inspector (or the asynchronous layout object that will likely replace it) to decide the constrained size on its own.
  - If that object wants to reach out to the data source or delegate (through a separate protocol a la `UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout`) to get advisement about the constrained size of an element, then it can. ASDK doesn't need to be involved.
  - For today, I advocate for leaving the constrained-size gathering system as-is. It is sufficient for our purposes, it is likely to change, and in my opinion, it is very unlikely to require ASDK to gather constrained sizes for all items upfront.

#### Wrapping Up

This diff also updates the examples to use the new API. They all run nicely. Once this API is approved, I'll apply it also to ASTableNode. Please be generous with your feedback!

- In the future, we might do some or all of the diffing asynchronously, but the cost-benefit doesn't justify that at this time.
  - We would have to be sure to wait for the update to complete if the user called `nodeForItemAtIndexPath:` or `numberOfItemsInSection` or `indexPathForNode:` or really any ASCollectionNode API.
  - We should call `dataForCollectionNode:` on the main thread because users are going to use main-thread-affine view controller flags, and their upstream data sources are main-thread-affine as well.

### Further Considerations

- How should a user trigger an update?
  - Option 1: Calling `reloadData` or ending a batch update always triggers the incremental update.
  - Option 2: A new method e.g. `performUpdateWithCompletion:` triggers the incremental update, and `reloadData` always invalidates everything.
  - Advocacy: Option 1.
    - Users are trained to throw `reloadData` when they aren't sure how to commit an update.
    - I can't think of a use case for ""throw away all the nodes that exists for all the identifiers and then reload."" I'm sure one exists out there, but this could be achieved by another means (see below).
- How should a user indicate they want to invalidate the existing node for a given identifier/section?
  - Consider the use case: a user taps on a pin, and now we want to change that pin to be represented by a different class of node.
  - If this method exists, it should live on the collection node itself, not on the data. They should be able to call it inside of `dataForCollectionNode:` as well as in arbitrary regions of their code , which might be slightly tricky.
  - Option 1: They can't. If you want to get a new node, change the identifier.
  - Option 2: Add a method like `invalidateElementWithIdentifier:` to ASCollectionNode that will pipe the invalidation through to both the current data, and to the data that is currently being configured.
- How should we gather the constrained size? What if they give us a different constrained size for an already-measured node?
  - I believe the correct solution is for the layout inspector (or the asynchronous layout object that will likely replace it) to decide the constrained size on its own.
  - If that object wants to reach out to the data source or delegate (through a separate protocol a la `UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout`) to get advisement about the constrained size of an element, then it can. ASDK doesn't need to be involved.
  - For today, I advocate for leaving the constrained-size gathering system as-is. It is sufficient for our purposes, it is likely to change, and in my opinion, it is very unlikely to require ASDK to gather constrained sizes for all items upfront.

2566,2016-11-07 23:31:04,"UICollectionView/UITableView API is a pain to work with. Does the message `Invalid number of items in section 0.

### What it Looks Like

#### Before:



#### After:



#### How it Works

If the data source implements the new method, all imperative updates are ignored. Whenever an update is submitted, the method is called. It retrieves a data object that contains all of the existing items and sections in the collection node, by identifier. It configures the data set how it wants it, we do a nested diff against the old data, and we update if needed.

#### Performance Considerations

- The diffing algorithm in this diff has been vastly optimized. I scrolled down through Pinterest's home feed a long way (30 seconds' worth) on my iPhone 6. Using the original diffing implementation, it spent about 1100ms diffing. After my optimizations, the number was around 33ms, which was small compared to the amount of time spent in UIKit machinery. 
- If the user adds an item with an identifier that already existed, then no allocations occur. If they provide the nodeBlock argument inline, then no `Block_copy` happens either. I've added documentation indicating that you will get somewhat improved performance by specifying the node block inline, rather than calling `[self nodeBlockForItemAtRow:]` or similar.

**Issue:**
Rotation from Portrait to Landscape in CustomCollectionView example does not trigger the layout inspector's `-constrainedSizeForNodeAtIndexPath` method. 

**Explanation:**
The collectionView's `scrollableDirections` was getting set to all directions because the bounds size changed before the content size changed. Going from portrait to landscape, the bounds size changed from a smaller width to a larger width, triggering a relayout of all nodes. Going from landscape to portrait, the bounds size changed from a larger width to a smaller width, causing the data controller to think that it was scrollable in the horizontal direction as well. 

Since laying out all nodes is expensive, we only do this if the bounds changes in the non-scrollable direction.  If, for example, a vertical flow layout has its height changed due to a status bar appearance update, we do not need to relayout all nodes. 

**Solution:**
make `-scrollableDirections` a required method for ASCollectionViewLayoutInspecting

- [x] update CustomCollectionView example
- [x] make scrollableDirections required for ASCollectionViewLayoutInspecting object
- [x] remove ASCollectionView's implementation",hannahmbanana,Baevra

2536,2016-11-02 19:30:40,"So I’ve been thinking about ways to eliminate, or at least minimize, flashes caused by `reloadData`. This is one of the top complaints from developers that are new to the framework. I have a couple of solutions in mind and would love to start a discussion here:

- Cell node prioritization:
  - I reckon one of the main causes of flashing is due to the fact that new cell nodes are initialized and laid out linearly, meaning they are handled from first to last index. Instead, we should have prioritized them based on the ranges. Nodes in visible range should be handled first, followed by the ones in fetch data range and so on. We can even block main thread while dealing with the highest priority nodes (i.e. visible ones).
  - One possible issue with this technique is that it needs to maintain content offset of the scroll view. In other words, we need to keep a static viewport while deleting/inserting nodes. 
  - This solution maybe easier to implement once virtualization is supported, or maybe a step toward virtualization.

- Another way to solve this problem is hiding external components (esp. the underlying table/collection view) from the fact that `reloadData`is broken down into a series of deletions and insertions. What it means is that, while making changes to the data set, we don't notify `ASDataControllerDelegate` at all. Then once we finished loading all cells, the delegate will be notified about a single atomic reload operation.

I believe either of these solutions can eliminate the flash. Although it will make developers less likely to do batch update :(

  - One possible issue with this technique is that it needs to maintain content offset of the scroll view. In other words, we need to keep a static viewport while deleting/inserting nodes. 
  - This solution maybe easier to implement once virtualization is supported, or maybe a step toward virtualization.

- Another way to solve this problem is hiding external components (esp. the underlying table/collection view) from the fact that `reloadData`is broken down into a series of deletions and insertions. What it means is that, while making changes to the data set, we don't notify `ASDataControllerDelegate` at all. Then once we finished loading all cells, the delegate will be notified about a single atomic reload operation.

I believe either of these solutions can eliminate the flash. Although it will make developers less likely to do batch update :(

- Only call `beginUpdates/endUpdates` if the node's height changed as a result of remeasuring against content view.
- Subtract section index frame from bounds-width when determining the row width. Otherwise, when the cell comes on screen, it's going to have to synchronously remeasure.
- Fix an unrelated issue where if you call `ASTableNode.numberOfSections` before the first layout, it'll reload data with `_nodesConstrainedWidth = 0` and all the rows will get measured against 0 which is less than ideal.

@chrisdanford Would you be willing to download this as a patch and try it against Pinterest to make sure that I haven't regressed anything since the last profiling?

2501,2016-10-28 18:29:52,"When using a section index with a table node, there is extra overhead because the constrained size used to measure the node in advance doesn't match the content size of the resulting cell.

For instance, if the table is 320 wide, and the index is 15 wide, the node will be initially measured against 320 and when it appears on screen it will have to be remeasured against 305. The remeasure also requires a table view -beginUpdates/-endUpdates call which also takes time.

(I also thought it was more expressive but that could just be me.)

It seems the standard library protocols follow one of three patterns:
1) Hashable, Equatable, Comparable etc imply a conforming objects acts a certain way
2) CollectionType, IntegerType, BooleanType imply an object is in a certain family of types
3) FloatLiteralConvertible, ArrayLiteralConvertible etc imply an object can be converted to or from a certain type.

To me that this protocol falls into the -able category in that it describes objects that can act a certain way.

Of course, conforming to this convention may not be a priority for ASDK, but it seems like it might be nice for at least public facing protocols to be in line with Swifty stuff unless there was a reason not to.

Even though the property `@property (nonatomic, weak) id<ASCollectionViewLayoutInspecting> layoutInspector;` is declared as weak, it's backed up by a non weak iVar:



so on the overridden setter we are actually retaining it:



This was causing a retain cycle where my view controller was setting itself as the layout inspector and never being deallocated.



After changing the iVar declaration to `__weak id<ASCollectionViewLayoutInspecting> _layoutInspector;` the problem disappeared.

If that's a valid issue, maybe there are other places with the same issue as well?

As @appleguy identified in #2392, there's a lot of headroom in terms of reducing object allocations and `weak` object handling.

I removed the `flattened` flag because I don't believe it serves a purpose. During the filtering, we only travel _down_ the tree. In the prior implementation, we only marked the newly-copied ASLayout objects as `flattened` so it's impossible that we would encounter a flattened layout as we traverse down the sublayouts.

After this change, the `position` value of the sublayouts will be changed by calling `filteredNodeLayoutTree`. I think this is fine. Nobody cares about the old `position` values.

This needs some profiling!

2392,2016-10-16 07:08:38,"@Adlai-Holler @maicki Cool, I have some interesting profiling results.  We are spending an astounding amount of time dealing with the weak variable .layoutElement on ASLayout.

We're also triggering creation of the new .style object even when it is not needed / set to all-default values, but this is nowhere near as significant as the weak variable and general object cost of ASLayout.

This is an **inverted** tree showing the cost of weak, primarily layoutElement, on the powerful A8X over a short period of ~2 seconds of intense work.  The figures are pretty astounding!  The folded aggregations that do exceed weak represent the cost of object allocations in general, but unsure how actionable that is.

If we found an alternative data structure to perform the ASLayout -> ASLayoutElement weak mapping, it could pay off hugely, because of the extreme commonality of these objects (during both initial layout calculation and then flattening).  If we could ensure safety of unsafe_unretained (maybe by having the ASLayoutElement clear its own back-pointer on dealloc), that's one fix.  Perhaps only during the initial layout tree creation, before the longer-lived flattened version is created, there may be a guarantee that the ASLayoutElement will live as long as the ASLayout.

It seems likely that we can skip this copy. The old `position` value is probably not important to anyone. And `flattened` is only read on the layout's sublayouts in that same method, so unless we have a circular dependency the flag could probably be removed entirely.

I tend to either add the assertion from this pull request and remove the comment about removing this check after 2.0 **OR** remove it all completely now.

I think we should make a call soon and either merge this PR or close it based on the decision.

To help tackle this major problem, this diff:
- Add failing unit tests for the new behavior.
- Makes `nodeAtIndexPath` and `indexPathForNode` work in the _data source's_ index space, not in the UIKit index space. So immediately after submitting an update, if you call `nodeAtIndexPath:` you'll get the new node.
- Deprecate `calculatedSizeForNodeAtIndexPath`: we should let them get the node and call `calculatedSize` instead – now that the index space distinction is more clear we should centralize all our logic on nodes instead.
- Removes the `indexPath` argument from `collectionView:willDisplayNode:forItemAtIndexPath:` and friends.
  - The `indexPath` was provided by the collection view and would not be correct for accessing their data source.
  - They can always call `indexPathForNode:` to get the data-source index path for the node, if needed. If the item for the node has been deleted from the collection view i.e. no longer exists in the data source, they'll get nil back. It's a bummer, but c'est la vie. The delegate will probably still want to know that a given node is being displayed, even if it no longer corresponds to an item.
- Add some assertions about what happens on main vs on editing queue. These are all pretty safe I believe, and are mostly there for documentation/regression-proofing.
- Add supplementary nodes into our collection view tests.

**NOTE**: I have added a unit test for similar behavior to be applied to supplementary nodes. This diff is already big enough just handling it for rows/items, so the unit test is disabled and I will enable it + the feature in a follow-up diff.

2339,2016-10-07 06:42:15,"@Y-fate @caophong94: I was curious about this too and asked @appleguy. :) This is his response:

""This retain cycle is intentionally created because the node is in a ""live"" view hierarchy (it is inside the a UIWindow that is onscreen). 

To see why this is necessary, apple also creates this retain cycle between UIView and CALayer. If you create a UIView and add its layer to a super layer, and then release the UIView, it will stay alive even though the CALayer delegate pointing to it is weak. 

For the same reason, if the node's view is a descendant of a window, but there is no reference to the node, we keep the node alive with a strong reference from the view. 

Good application design should not rely on this behavior, because a strong reference to the node should be maintained by the subnodes array or by an instance variable. However, this condition occasionally occurs, for example when using a UIView animation API. This cycle should never create a leak or even extend the lifecycle of a node any longer than it is absolutely necessary. If you find something counter to this, please let us know!

This diff contains no functional changes. Its only purpose is to help make the system easier to understand and open the door for more general usage:
- Add nullability and generics to the system.
- Rename and move the `asyncdisplaykit_currentAsyncLayerTransaction` property out from the special `CALayer (ASAsyncTransaction)` category up into the `ASAsyncTransaction` protocol itself with the new name `asyncdisplaykit_currentAsyncTransaction`. Matching other cases like this, `UIView` and `ASDisplayNode` pass through to the layer in their conformance.
- Shorten names e.g. `ASDisplayNodeAsyncTransactionContainer` -> `ASAsyncTransactionContainer`
- Reduce underscores in `ASAsyncTransaction` so it's less scary.
- Replace references to `container layers` – which appear to be an old subclass of `CALayer` that's gone now – with either `layer` or `container` based on the context.

I'm actually currently looking into a different solution already mentioned above. In my opinion (and also talking with a couple of other developer) instead of fixing the broken behavior of `ASVideoNode`, we should prefer composition over inheritance and let `ASVideoNode` inherit from `ASDisplayNode` instead of `ASNetworkImageNode`. This would allow any developer to use the core components and combine them the way they want without having an overhead like `ASVideoNode` and `ASNetworkImageNode`. We could than create a mother component that could combine these two, but my solution for this issue would still to not use the backing `ASNetworkImageNode` functionality at all.

2278,2016-09-24 16:49:45,"Thanks for raising this @george-gw. It's unfortunate – `UIControlState` declares `UIControlStateNormal = 0` but in Swift it gets a `public static var normal: UIControlState { get }`. Having a ""zero"" option like this is [not technically allowed](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithCAPIs.html) but Apple must've made some special exception.

I think we have two choices here:
- Do nothing. In Swift you'll have to use `[]` to represent an ""empty"" control state. Not really acceptable.
- Investigate whether we can add an optional Swift file into ASDK that defines an extension on `UIControlState` that adds the static var. Ideal outcome, extremely costly and perhaps impossible.
- Define `ASControlStateNormal = 1` as you mentioned. Fixes the Swift import, but diverges from UIKit's values and creates a new ""undefined"" 0 state. Also it's conceptually incorrect – normal means 0 flags.
- Replace `ASControlState` with `UIControlState`. Fixes everything, but we lose control of the enum. We could use `#define ASControlState UIControlState` to ease the transition.

We should do the last one. Apple has created a special exception for themselves and we should piggyback on it. The likelihood of us creating some new control state in the future is extremely low. This also eliminates code which is always nice. @appleguy @maicki could someone else weigh in?

- Have ASIndexedNodeContext own the creation operation and the finished node.
  - Likely that ASIndexedNodeContext evolves into a sort of `ASCollectionItem` object, that survives beyond the initial insertion of the item.

### 1) Initial PR was merged

The initial [PR](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/2110) for ASDK 2.0 Layout was merged into ASDK Master. This does not mean we are done with it. There are further API refinement necessary as described in the next steps section.
### 2) Documentation

I started to write documentation around our Layout system. It’s not just for the “new” API I would like to write guides to help developers become familiar with the whole system. Currently all the docs are available via a gist or a PR where you can comment on:
- [ASDK 2 Layout Documentation](https://gist.github.com/maicki/b1a8091df04ed14f8ec0aa333848c4a5)
- [ASDK 2 Layout Documentation PR](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/2195)
- [ASDK 2.0 Layout Convert 1.x To 2.0](https://gist.github.com/maicki/c6c56c1f9ce514ee7c334e3016c3bad7)
## Next Steps:
### 1) Name of the `size` property on ASLayoutable

Currently each `ASLayoutable` has a `size` property. This property is abstracted away via width, height, minWidth, minHeight, maxWidth, maxHeight properties so not accessible at all for developers, but it’s possible to set a size via `setSizeWithCGSize:` or `setExactSizeWithCGSize`.

The biggest concern with the size property is the naming.  .size = is very similar to bounds.size =, yet they are extremely different.  In the most literal sense, this is not the “size of the node” — it is the size range that the node would like to be.

After some internal conversation with the ASDK team the following names were proposed:
- intrinsicContentSize
- layoutSize
- sizeRange
- contentSize
- containerSize
### 2) Rename `ASLayoutable` and `ASLayoutableSize`

We have been thinking about possible replacement names for `ASLayoutable`. Since the initial PR re-enforces the content area concept of each node, we come up with the name `ASLayoutContainer`. We already have this pattern at the `ASAsyncTransaction` level, with `ASAyncTransactionContainer` being a protocol that allows certain objects to create and maintain transactions
### 3) Rename `ASStaticLayoutSpec` to `ASRelativeLayoutSpec` / `ASAbsoluteLayoutSpec`

I think we are all on the same page that `ASStaticLayoutSpec` is not optimal for this kind of layout spec as it is currently. We first had a conversation around renaming it to `ASAbsoluteLayoutSpec`, but @levi had a good points to rename it to `ASRelativeLayoutSpec`. The problem with that is that we actually already have a `ASRelativeLayoutSpec`, that after talking with @appleguy is also not really a great name for the layout spec it represents.
### 4) `preferredFrameSize` deprecation

With the ASDK 2.0 Layout API the `preferredFrameSize` is not necessary anymore. The current question is how to handle the deprecation. Here are the two ways that where discussed internally:
- Radically deprecate `preferredFrameSize`  Remove all support for `preferredFrameSize` and just move the property to the deprecated header with a deprecated marker. This basically means setting a `preferredFrameSize` will do nothing anymore.
- Gracefully deprecate `preferredFrameSize`: Move the property to the deprecated header, but still support it the same way we did at the moment. Don’t remove code until maybe 3.0 and remove all appearances of `preferredFrameSize`
### 5) Introduce `layoutableThatFits:` and maybe deprecate `layoutSpecThatFits:`

With the introduction of ASDK 2.0 Layout we would support returning an `ASLayoutable` from `layoutSpecThatFits:`. As `layoutSpecThatFits:` explicitly returns a `ASLayoutSpec` class this is not possible. One way to handle this would be to introduce `layoutableThatFits:` (or something like  `layoutableContainerThatFits:`) where the developer can return an `ASLayoutable` (or whoever we will name it). This basically means it’s not necessary anymore to wrap nodes in layout specs just to return a layout spec from `layoutSpecThatFits:`, although it would not be needed in the first place. This pattern is often seen in production code as developers are wrapping nodes in static layout specs or inset layout specs (with inset zero) just to return a layout spec.

**Everyone who would like to be involved in shaping the future of ASDK 2.0 Layout please let us know you feedback and let’s work together to have great discussions and final decissions for “next steps” in ASDK as soon as possible.**

The initial [PR](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/2110) for ASDK 2.0 Layout was merged into ASDK Master. This does not mean we are done with it. There are further API refinement necessary as described in the next steps section.
### 2) Documentation

I started to write documentation around our Layout system. It’s not just for the “new” API I would like to write guides to help developers become familiar with the whole system. Currently all the docs are available via a gist or a PR where you can comment on:
- [ASDK 2 Layout Documentation](https://gist.github.com/maicki/b1a8091df04ed14f8ec0aa333848c4a5)
- [ASDK 2 Layout Documentation PR](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/2195)
- [ASDK 2.0 Layout Convert 1.x To 2.0](https://gist.github.com/maicki/c6c56c1f9ce514ee7c334e3016c3bad7)
## Next Steps:
### 1) Name of the `size` property on ASLayoutable

Currently each `ASLayoutable` has a `size` property. This property is abstracted away via width, height, minWidth, minHeight, maxWidth, maxHeight properties so not accessible at all for developers, but it’s possible to set a size via `setSizeWithCGSize:` or `setExactSizeWithCGSize`.

The biggest concern with the size property is the naming.  .size = is very similar to bounds.size =, yet they are extremely different.  In the most literal sense, this is not the “size of the node” — it is the size range that the node would like to be.

After some internal conversation with the ASDK team the following names were proposed:
- intrinsicContentSize
- layoutSize
- sizeRange
- contentSize
- containerSize
### 2) Rename `ASLayoutable` and `ASLayoutableSize`

We have been thinking about possible replacement names for `ASLayoutable`. Since the initial PR re-enforces the content area concept of each node, we come up with the name `ASLayoutContainer`. We already have this pattern at the `ASAsyncTransaction` level, with `ASAyncTransactionContainer` being a protocol that allows certain objects to create and maintain transactions
### 3) Rename `ASStaticLayoutSpec` to `ASRelativeLayoutSpec` / `ASAbsoluteLayoutSpec`

I think we are all on the same page that `ASStaticLayoutSpec` is not optimal for this kind of layout spec as it is currently. We first had a conversation around renaming it to `ASAbsoluteLayoutSpec`, but @levi had a good points to rename it to `ASRelativeLayoutSpec`. The problem with that is that we actually already have a `ASRelativeLayoutSpec`, that after talking with @appleguy is also not really a great name for the layout spec it represents.
### 4) `preferredFrameSize` deprecation

With the ASDK 2.0 Layout API the `preferredFrameSize` is not necessary anymore. The current question is how to handle the deprecation. Here are the two ways that where discussed internally:
- Radically deprecate `preferredFrameSize`  Remove all support for `preferredFrameSize` and just move the property to the deprecated header with a deprecated marker. This basically means setting a `preferredFrameSize` will do nothing anymore.
- Gracefully deprecate `preferredFrameSize`: Move the property to the deprecated header, but still support it the same way we did at the moment. Don’t remove code until maybe 3.0 and remove all appearances of `preferredFrameSize`
### 5) Introduce `layoutableThatFits:` and maybe deprecate `layoutSpecThatFits:`

With the introduction of ASDK 2.0 Layout we would support returning an `ASLayoutable` from `layoutSpecThatFits:`. As `layoutSpecThatFits:` explicitly returns a `ASLayoutSpec` class this is not possible. One way to handle this would be to introduce `layoutableThatFits:` (or something like  `layoutableContainerThatFits:`) where the developer can return an `ASLayoutable` (or whoever we will name it). This basically means it’s not necessary anymore to wrap nodes in layout specs just to return a layout spec from `layoutSpecThatFits:`, although it would not be needed in the first place. This pattern is often seen in production code as developers are wrapping nodes in static layout specs or inset layout specs (with inset zero) just to return a layout spec.

**Everyone who would like to be involved in shaping the future of ASDK 2.0 Layout please let us know you feedback and let’s work together to have great discussions and final decissions for “next steps” in ASDK as soon as possible.**

""This commit makes some changes to the ASKD ""dealloc2main"" stuff that we are considering to include in 6.10 to potentially help us track down some top crashes.

This changes alters the ""dealloc2main"" retain / release logic slightly by also including an ""over release"" check when -retain is called.
The idea being: Catching the error at that point may allow us to determine at what point the incorrect -retain is happening, instead of at -release, at which point the forensic stack information about the error is no longer present.

There is also a small, one line change to -retainCount. It was changed to use __atomic_load_n instead of reading the ivar directly. I overlooked this case the last time I ran the thread sanitizer and cleaned up the problems it reported. No one calls retainCount anyways, but making the read of the ivar an atomic load is more formally correct.""

2207,2016-09-09 00:22:32,"- Will `_ASDisplayView` have a synthesized atomic accessor for the ivar, even though the getter is declared in a category of the superclass `UIView`?

Yes.  From the [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/EncapsulatingData/EncapsulatingData.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH5-SW5)

> By default, these accessor methods are synthesized automatically for you by the compiler, so you don’t need to do anything other than declare the property using `@property` in the class interface.
- Should we use that atomic accessor instead of direct ivar access?

Hmm.  While not obvious from a plain reading of the code, I believe that this is effectively achieved by using `ASDisplayNode *node = _asyncdisplaykit_node;`.  I don't see any advantage to using `self.asyncdisplaykit_node` vs. direct ivar access in this case as `_asyncdisplaykit_node` is a weak ivar and the weak to strong conversion implicility happens atomically.  One advantage of direct ivar access is that it's faster as it avoids a trip through the Objective C message dispatcher.

My recommendation is to leave it as is.
- If we only use the variable once during a given scope, what's the benefit in assigning it to a local variable? E.g.`[_asyncdisplaykit_node setTintColor:tintColor]`

None, really.  In my commit message I did mention this, though:

> These changes were made even if there's a single use of `_asyncdisplaykit_node` as a consistency / defensive measure so that anyone editing this code in the future does not accidentally use a `weak` reference twice.

Rebasing?  No.  But I did merge in the latest changes.

The issue was, view controllers in custom transitions are fullscreen in viewWillAppear: and when they get their correct size, we then overwrite it by calling -setNeedsLayout in -propagateNewEnvironmentTraitCollection, which remeasures us against the old bad size.

I added a failing test case that ensures everything is up-to-date before the first relayout after a rotation.

I expect this to be somewhat controversial because I did something unusual. In order for ASCollectionView to find out about the bounds change before UICollectionView requeries the layout object, I added an optional `ASCALayerExtendedDelegate` protocol. Basically if your view responds to these methods, ASDisplayLayer will call them. I can't use our _ASDisplayLayerDelegate because collection views may not have nodes.

I considered adding an _ASCollectionLayer class with special functionality but decided this more general solution was better.

I also renamed some ivars in ASCollectionView for clarity:

  - This value is not actually used as the max size for nodes constrained size.

2119,2016-09-12 21:18:24,"@gazreese I share your concerns about performance and architecture here. We have the alternative of doing `_playerNode.hidden=YES` and unhiding it in `play`.

That may save us some time during the state transitions, but it does have the drawback of accumulating AVPlayerLayer instances if the user scrolls through a feed of videos, watching each one and letting it reset. The developer may not be aware that the AVPlayerLayers are sticking around. 

I believe that AVPlayer itself, not the player layer, manages the resources for the video so it would be unlikely to cause more network traffic either way we go.

As my project is exactly as you describe, i.e. a feed of videos that the user scrolls through, I'm quite keen on the original remove/recreate method. I'm working in a memory-constrained environment, so I can't really risk leaking the AVPlayerLayer objects.

@appleguy @maxsz or @binl - if you have any comments they would be much appreciated.

2110,2016-08-19 23:53:56,"### Goal:

The main goal is to add a constrained size to the `ASLayoutable` protocol. This will be represented by a `ASLayoutableSize` struct. In comparison to `-[ASDisplayNode preferredFrameSize]` this size can be set on every `ASLayoutable` and not only on a `ASDisplayNode` object.

The API is loosely inspired from the CSS Box Model. An ASLayoutableSize looks like this:



That said `ASLayoutableSize` is abstracted away from all `ASLayoutable`s and to set e.g. the `width` you just have to set it directly to an `ASLayoutable`:



By default all `ASLayoutableSize` values will be `ASDimensionTypeAuto`, that means that it's indicating ""I have no opinion"" and may be resolved in whatever way makes most sense given the circumstances, e.g. in case of a `ASTextNode`, it is automatically calculates it's size based on it's content if `width` and `height` are `ASDimensionTypeAuto`.
### Documentation:
- [Layout with AsyncDisplayKit](https://gist.github.com/maicki/b1a8091df04ed14f8ec0aa333848c4a5)
- [Convert from 1.x to 2](https://gist.github.com/maicki/c6c56c1f9ce514ee7c334e3016c3bad7)
### Changes:
- [x] Add `-[ASLayoutable size]` with type `ASLayoutableSize`.
- [x] `-[ASLayoutable size]` is not exposed, therefore the following properties where added: `-[ASLayoutable width]`, `-[ASLayoutable height]`, `-[ASLayoutable minHeight]`, `-[ASLayoutable maxHeight]`, `-[ASLayoutable minWidth]`, `-[ASLayoutable maxWidth]`
- [x] Deprecate `-[ASDisplayNode preferredFrameSize]` and remove support for it in `ASTextNode`, `ASImageNode`, `ASButtonNode`
- [x] Merge `-[ASLayoutable calculateLayoutThatFits:` and `-[ASLayoutable measureWithSizeRange:]` (more details in the header description for this methods, but here is a tldr):
  - Changed behavior of `-[ASLayoutable calculateLayoutThatFits:]`: Call this on children layoutables to compute their layouts within your implementation of `-[ASLayoutable calculateLayoutThatFits:]`.
  - Introduce `-[ASLayoutable layoutThatFits:]`, `-[ASLayoutable layoutThatFits:parentSize:]`
  - Introduce `-[ASLayoutable calculateLayoutThatFits:restrictedToSizeRange:relativeToParentSize:]`: ASLayoutable's implementation of `-layoutThatFits:parentSize:` calls this method to resolve the component's size against `parentSize`, intersect it with `constrainedSize`, and call `-calculateLayoutThatFits:` with the result. In certain advanced cases, you may want to customize this logic. Overriding this method allows you to receive all three parameters and do the computation yourself.
- [x] Deprecate `-[ASDisplayNode measure:]`: Naming is not optimal and familiar for developers
- [x] Deprecate `-[ASLayoutable measureWithSizeRange:]` use `ASCalculateRootLayout ()` instead
- [x] Add `ASCalculateRootLayout()`: Safely calculates the layout of the given root layoutable by guarding against nil nodes.
- [x] Add `ASCalculateLayout()`: Safely computes the layout of the given node by guarding against nil nodes.
- [x] Rename `-[ASLayout constrainedSizeRange]` to `-[ASLayout constrainedSize]` to align with all other places we use a 'constrainedSize'
- [x] Rename `-[ASLayout layoutableObject]` to `-[ASLayout layoutable]`
- [x] Remove `-[ASDisplayNode preferredFrameSize]` and move over to `-[ASDisplayNode size]` for 'examples_extra/'
- [x] Add deprecation warning to `-[ASDisplayNode preferredFrameSize]`
- [x] Add deprecation warning to `-[ASLayoutable measureWithSizeRange:]`
- [x] Remove Unit Tests for `-[ASDisplayNode preferredFrameSize]`
- [X] Adjust Unit Tests for `-[ASLayoutable size]`
- [x] Use `[ASLayoutable size]` for layout the child within a `ASStaticLayoutSpec` as we will remove `[ASStaticLayoutable sizeRange]` and `ASRelativeSizeRange` 
- [x] Add `ASWrapperLayoutSpec` that can be used as wrapper around a `ASLayoutable` to just pass through the layout creation
- [x] Remove `ASRelativeSizeRange` as well as `sizeRange` in `ASStaticLayoutSpec`.
- [x] Make `ASRelativeSize` private in `ASDimension.h` as it's used in there for some calculations
- [x] Rename `ASRelativeDimension` to `ASDimension`
- [x] Add helper for creating `ASDimension`: `ASDimensionMake`, `ASD`

",yxztj,appleguy
2105,2016-10-10 11:44:16,"@appleguy After spending some time diving into ASTextKitRenderer, here's what I've found: 

Suppose we have 10 lines of text, 5px height for text and 2px lineSpacing, setting maximumNumberOfLines to 3. During the time, [ASTextKitRenderer _calculateSize] is called several times.

## First pass:

Creating [ASTextKitRenderer context] with unlimited constrainedSize in height.
Truncate textStorage into 3 lines. Set node's _calculatedSize height to the height of 3 lines, which is **19px**(5px \* 3 + 2px \* 2) 

## Second pass:

The context is re-created with constrained size(19px height) and original 10 lines of text.
Now the truncator uses height of 19px in [layoutManager glyphRangeForBoundingRect]. This is enough for the text after truncation(3 lines of text), however the rect is not enough for clipping 10 lines of text into 3 lines, which needs at least **21px** height(5 \* 3 + 2 \* 3, the lineSpacing after 3rd line is also counted. I guess both the text height and lineSpacing below it are needed for layoutManager to calculate glyph range) So we only got 2 lines finally.

Hope we can get a fix based on information above :)

2105,2016-10-31 18:28:11,"@Adlai-Holler - since you looked at ASTextNode recently, do the symptoms described here sound familiar in any sense?

@yxztj Thanks for your patience!  We are almost done adopting all of the 2.0 APIs in Pinterest, so we should be able to investigate this in the next couple weeks.

2105,2016-11-08 17:56:05,"@Adlai-Holler @appleguy Just looked into that a bit with master. So apparently this works now reliable, unfortunately reliable wrong. Setting the `maximumNumberOfLines` to 3 (no matter truncationAttributedString is set) the text node will show only 2 lines of text but the text node is in fact the right size.

@johnepinterest is investigating in this area.  

 Updating the framework would be good. Do you happen to use the name _propertyLock for any of your instance variables? We address this in the latest version, but if you are shadowing this variable, it could cause an issue like this in the last version.  (1.9.80, fixed as one of a number of improvements in 1.9.81)

Pinterest is currently shipping off of the branch called 1.9.90.  If you are willing to point to a branch in your Podfile, this is considered stable and is the best version at the moment.  We will push a pod in a week or two.  1.9.81 is an ok choice as well, but .90 has both performance and some stability improvements.

I believe the issue here is that you're accessing `self.layer` inside `ASDisplayNode.init()` which is called on a background thread sometimes – such as when using `ASCellNode`. If you move all the `CABasicAnimation` and `CALayer` related code out from `init` and into `didLoad` (which is always run on the main thread) you will stop hitting that assertion.

@appleguy I'd like to cancel laying out nodes on reload data, but I'm hesitating because I want your opinion about the risk involved with completion handlers. So if I call insertRowsAtIndexPaths: with 20 items, and in the completion handler I assume those 20 items are there, but I pre-empted it with reloadData, we should probably still call the completion handler but those items may not have been inserted. I think we should go for it in a separate PR, and if it ever becomes an issue deal with it at that time.

Note: It would be tempting to replace a couple of our NSMutableSets with NSHashTables. Namely, `_cellsForVisibilityUpdates` and `_pendingDisplayNodes`. We don't really want to retain the cells/nodes in those cases, but according to https://www.objc.io/issues/7-foundation/collections/#nshashtable NSHashTable inserts are much slower than NSMutableSet inserts, so I opted to leave it.

1945,2016-07-18 13:39:23,"Hi everyone!

I had reordering cells feature working well with ASCollectionView in my project. After upgrade to 1.9.81 it had stopped working. 

What I do is:
- Add UIPanGestureRecognizer to ASCollectionView
- on UIPanGestureRecognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged (when user is reordering cells) I make some calculations, change layout attributes a little bit and use ASCollectionView.performBatchUpdates:completion: with empty block to trigger relayout with animation.


- Result: Cells don't switch positions as they used to with previous version. :(

I checked commits that may cause this issue and found out that this is the one: https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/commit/c62a4d3e79e6a5cdaf4cf5ba14300ed3bdbf9fa9

I also checked if `invalidateLayout` method would work and it works, but there is no animation (as always). 

@Adlai-Holler and others: Do you have any idea how can I fix this and still use latest ASDK version? 
Thank you a lot!

I took time to do this carefully enough that I feel regressions are unlikely once it has been fully tested with the app, which I'll do over the weekend.  I am very familiar with the original state of the code.

I'd like to switch the order of the if / else so that rasterization comes second, but didn't want to move it for now so the diff has a slight element of readability lol.

This should improve efficiency by eliminating several lock acquisitions, and also adding a few strategically relevant isCancelled checks.

- ASCollectionNode and ASTableNode declare their conformance in a category, which apparently doesn't work and causes the runtime to return NO for conformsToProtocol:
- Pinterest (and I'm sure other apps) have ASViewControllers with non-table, non-collection nodes. Sometimes these are plain old ASDisplayNodes. None of them conform to the update protocol.
- ASTableNode and ASCollectionNode did not implement +setRangeModeForMemoryWarnings: so they actually didn't conform to the updating protocol. This also means none of our users is calling that method or it would have crashed.
- Worst of all, we had no idea that none of this was working.

So
- Move the conformances in ASTableNode/ASCollectionNode to the main @interface instead of the category. This makes them return YES from `conformsToProtocol`.
- Allow ASViewController to conform to the range updating protocol as well as its node.
- Add a one-time-per-VC log if we try to adjust the range mode but can't because neither the VC nor the node conforms to the protocol.
- **BREAKING** Remove +setRangeModeForMemoryWarnings from the protocol and replace with a global method `+[ASDisplayNode setRangeModeForMemoryWarnings:]`.
  - I think we can land this even with the breaking change.
  - Obviously nobody was calling it or they would have gotten crashes.
  - It's not clear what calling it on, say, ASTableNode would have done. It would probably have called through to ASRangeController, which would have affected ASCollectionNode as well.

  - It's not clear what calling it on, say, ASTableNode would have done. It would probably have called through to ASRangeController, which would have affected ASCollectionNode as well.
  - It would be a pain to override for every conforming node/VC.

This also resolves the issue that can occur if a node is already loaded deep in the layout hierarchy in the layout that the node is transforming to. Before insertion or deletion is happening we need to crawl the layout hierarchy to check that though.

_Open things:_

- Split section reloads into delete and insert.
- Improve the logic for computing final indexes from initial indexes.
- Improve logging/loggability of update events.
- Add more type annotations.
#### Reloads and Moves

I removed `ASDataController`s implementation of reloadSections/reloadItems. Reloads and moves are ""composite"" operations – they require knowledge of the entire batch update so they can be decomposed into deletes (at old indexes) and inserts (at new indexes). ASDataController was intentionally set up to receive updates in ""safe order"" so that it can modify its internal arrays bit-by-bit during updates. There is no such ""safe order"" for moves and reloads as such. The responsibility falls for `ASChangeSetDataController` to decompose all updates into deletes & inserts.

The logic for moves is not touched by this diff, but there is currently an issue where moves may lead to incorrect behavior when combined with other operations in a batch. Moves are tricky business because you have to perform the deletes stashing the nodes away, and then use those nodes when you perform the inserts later. ASChangeSetDataController could provide its superclass with a structure specifying which nodes should be used when inserting which sections/items, at the beginning of the batch update.

There are currently ASDataController-called subclass override methods like `willReloadSections:`. These are used by ASCollectionDataController to maintain supplementary items.
- Since reloads are necessarily split into two operations which will typically not be performed back-to-back, this kind of callback doesn't totally make sense.
- Since the operations we need to perform on supplementary items are basically direct mirrors of the operations we perform for cell items, this pattern is a little wonky. The ideal solution would be to treat supplementary items and cells the same way. This is how UICollectionView works but it will require pretty major refactoring.
- For this PR I've removed `willReloadSections` and `willReloadItems`. The combination of `willDelete` and `willInsert`, called at the appropriate times, achieves the same result or better.
- Something similar will probably have to be done for moves, if we choose not to refactor the supplementary item handling first.

There's obviously a lot more to be done here – unifying cells and supplementary views, handling moves – but I'm very confident this is an extremely worthwhile step forward. @appleguy @maicki @levi Could I get a review on this?

### What I Did
- You can switch between UIKit/ASDK so we can shift blame as needed.
- Base test ""testThrashingWildly"" runs 100 iterations of random updates to a 20x20 table view.
- When a thrash test fails, it logs what it was attempting to do and a Base64 representation of the failed update. 
- You can copy this Base64 into the ""ASThrashTestRecordedCase"" file and the ""testRecordedThrashCase"" method will load it and try again now that you've fixed the issue.
### What It Did

UIKit reliably passes the thrash testing. This is actually good! Because it means that the updates I'm generating are consistently valid. ASDK reliably doesn't pass the thrash testing – it submits invalid updates up to UITableView and triggers assertion failures. This isn't good. I'll find out why shortly.

1802,2016-06-23 00:16:07,"Good news and bad news, folks! Good news is we now have a thrash tester to tell us if we have data integrity problems in table view. Bad news is, we have data integrity problems in table view. 
### What I Did
- You can switch between UIKit/ASDK so we can shift blame as needed.
- Base test ""testThrashingWildly"" runs 100 iterations of random updates to a 20x20 table view.
- When a thrash test fails, it logs what it was attempting to do and a Base64 representation of the failed update. 
- You can copy this Base64 into the ""ASThrashTestRecordedCase"" file and the ""testRecordedThrashCase"" method will load it and try again now that you've fixed the issue.
### What It Did

UIKit reliably passes the thrash testing. This is actually good! Because it means that the updates I'm generating are consistently valid. ASDK reliably doesn't pass the thrash testing – it submits invalid updates up to UITableView and triggers assertion failures. This isn't good. I'll find out why shortly.
### What I Will Do

Next step is to migrate to collection view and add supplementary views. That probably won't happen until after this basic hurdle is passed and other stuff is also done too.

I think the ideal behavior here is to clear self.image in -setAsset: _if it was automatically set_ but otherwise the node itself should never `self.image = nil`. Thoughts @gazreese @appleguy ?

This is one part of a broader issue for users of ASDK: the separation between ""data source index space"" and ""completed nodes index space.""

There is a lot of good information in the linked issues, and @Adlai-Holler will follow up here.

The tester is capable of recording a randomized series of edit transactions for later reproduction of issues, once it uncovers crashes.

With the default run loop mode we use (`NSDefaultRunLoop`) animated images pause while they are scrolling if they are in a scroll view. Thanks to @ejensen that can now be fixed by setting `animatedImageRunLoopMode` to `NSRunLoopCommonModes`.

I suspect most users would expect an animated image to continue animating while scrolling. While there is a fix (set `imageNode.animatedImageRunLoopMode = NSRunLoopCommonModes` on any nodes that are in a scroll view), it's not the default functionality and it's not obvious what needs to be done without some research.

I think it makes more sense to make `NSRunLoopCommonModes` the default and send the developer what wants animated images to pause while scrolling digging for the answer (they will likely be thinking about performance tuning, hopefully they would find it quickly.)

I’ve seen in the community it is quite common to not set the .delegate, whether or not this is advisable (it is supported by Apple).

There is also a close parallelism between the nodeFor: and constrainedSizeFor: methods, but ultimately we need to make a decision on the other PR’s course to landing safely before deciding if this should also be in the delegate.

You can see that thread 48 is traversing down the node hierarchy. `cancelLayoutTransitionsInProgress` locks self, and then updates the hierarchy state of the entire subtree (taking each of those locks). So the locks overlap ""downward.""

Thread 1 in `removeFromSupernode` locks self, and then attempts to read `supernode.layerBacked` which takes the lock. So the locks overlap ""upward.""

We should avoid this overlapping behavior as much as possible. If it has to happen, we should do it in a consistent order to avoid deadlocks. ""Downward"" is the natural default here – it's how trees work – so this PR removes the upward overlapping in `removeFromSupernode`. @appleguy

I will work on fixing this but I wanted to put up something fast to get us around the _extra_ long run times we experienced today. 

Findings:
- the elapsed time as reported by Travis is incorrect because it ran 5 of the builds in parallel (~20 min) and then the life-without-cocoa-pods afterwards (~3 min), so it only reports the 3 min elapsed time. Total time was really **~25 minutes: this is a reduction from previous build time**. Perhaps there is a 5 build limit per run?
- no matter what order I ran and reran our builds in, this build always was queued last. Supposedly builds are queued in order across all OSS projects, but I'm wondering if the extra resources required to run this more parallel job somehow de-prioritized it?
- 25 min total run time is better than the 1 hr+ we experienced today, except that the lead time 'til the batch starts is now the long pole. **Most of our builds were queued for 3-4 hours before they started today**. 
- It looks like there is a 164 build limit for OSS projects on Travis, which gets maxed out during normal working hours (9am - 7pm). You can see the status here: https://www.traviscistatus.com/ 
- Several options if this becomes unacceptable: pay $129/mo for 2 concurrent builds spots on Travis (supposedly the best github integration and low maintainence), pay $50/mo for Circle CI (Adlai used this before, reports comparing the two services I found online said iOS builds have issues failing on Circle and are hard to debug), Jenkins (issues with plugins to GitHub, LOTS of maintainence required, could run on our own fast hardware, have experts at Pintrest already?)

For example, on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, or even most YouTube sessions - it's unlikely enough for a user to come back to watch a previous video that it is likely a waste of space.  However, caching one video up to a maximum of ~50MB, maybe 500MB for a very video-heavy app, could make sense if the user wants to come back and resume a current video.

Because of this highly app-dependent need, I'm not sure that video caching will be implemented by the core ASDK team in the near future.  We are definitely interested to ensure that it is possible for a developer to do this, though.  @Eke or @lappp9 might have some thoughts on the right API override points to make this possible.  Ironically, since it now descends from ASNetworkImageNode, we might be able to plug into the downloader API (or use it for inspiration) to create a Video downloader / data source API.

1731,2016-06-09 05:28:36,"@boreys: Great question! There are two issues at play here: (1) the limits of ASDK's gif support and (2) the fact that a size is required to layout all ASDK image nodes. 

I believe that ASNeworkImageNode's gif support was not designed to support a large number of gifs. Depending on the size of the gifs (resolution, length), it could take a significant amount of memory and disk space to decode them, especially with many in a scrolling view. @garrettmoon: could you provide some insight on the limits of gif support?

If your goal is to show small (~20x20) gifs embedded in the text of the comments, I believe I have seen this done using a node as an attachment to the attributed string provided to the ASTextNode.

Comments on your code:
1. You can delete the imageNodeDidFinishDecoding: method. It is not needed in this use case. 
2. Your layoutSpecThatFits code is very close to working. However for image nodes specifically, you will need to specify the size of the node. This is confusing and not very well documented so I apologize. One way to do this is using the mediaNode.preferredFrameSize property. You could set this either in layoutSpecThatFits or in the imageNode:didLoadImage: method. 
3. FYI - layoutSpecs and nodes both conform to the ASLayoutable protocol, which means that you can mix and match them in the setChildren method. A more clean (and extensible) way to implement the layout you have would be to do something like below. Check out how the mediaNode is vertically stacked with the commentsNode inside the mainStack. 
   
   it could be cleaned up  has an issue.

1728,2016-06-08 20:14:55,"ASTextNode and ASImageNode currently implement drawing methods as instance methods. This breaks the custom class drawing methods. They will never be called for a subclass. Fixing it by adding a delegate object to the text / image node drawing methods to be able to dispatch the call to the instance method in ASDisplayNode.

To be able to work this way the original parameters needs to be passed to the superclass if a subclass calls the superclasses class drawing method.

cc @appleguy As we talked about this is a first proposal how we could tackle the broken custom class drawing methods. As also said we need to look into the locking issue that is already happening and likely still happening with this solution.

1697,2016-05-26 05:53:09,"During various layout changes that trigger content size changes, batch fetching needs to recalulate it's number of screens left to scroll before the delegate -collectionView:beginBatchFetchingWithContext: is called. 

Just exposes `[self _checkForBatchFetching];`

**UPDATE:**
Due to conversations with @appleguy the approach has changed to triggering `[self _checkForBatchFetching];`internally, at the appropriate times.

After some digging, it appears triggering this on `- (NSArray *)visibleNodeIndexPathsForRangeController:(ASRangeController *)rangeController` exhibits the least amount of additional calculations, but covers a range of use cases that require a batch fetch re-measurement.

From the code comments:

> // We must re-check the batch measurement range when additional cells enter the same visual area
>   // Use case is - User has 10 items visible, and wants to trigger batch updates at 2x visible screen size, so 20 records need to be fetched. User modifies the collection view (by pinch or other means) and it results in 15 items in the visible space. In order to achieve the 2x batch promise, we now need 30 records. This accounts for that by triggering a remeasurement at the appropriate time.

Approach 1: 
- expose `- (void)relayoutAllNodes` in `ASCollectionDataController` to `ASCollectionView` and `ASTableView`
-  call `relayoutItems()` in `ASCollectionView` to trigger all nodes to force their size to invalidate and remeasure

Approach 2: 
- in `ASDisplayNode`, modify `__setNeedsLayout` so `oldConstrainedSize` checks new `[self __constrainedSizeForLayout]`
- in `ASDisplayNode` private `__constrainedSizeForLayout` returns default `_constrainedSize`
- in `ASCellNode` we override `__constrainedSizeForLayout` to return new `ASSizeRange` calling new `constrainedSizeForLayoutWithOldConstrainedSize` delegate method in `ASCellNodeDelegate`
- `ASCollectionView` implements `ASCellNodeDelegate` `constrainedSizeForLayoutWithOldConstrainedSize` delegate method and returns `_asyncDataSource` `constrainedSizeForNodeAtIndexPath` effectively getting the new constrained size from the user's `collectionView` `constrainedSizeForNodeAtIndexPath` `ASCollectionDataSource` delegate implementation 
- User just needs to call `setNeedsLayout()` on any `ASCellNode` to force it's size to invalidate and remeasure

Findings so far:
Approach 1 works well, but may be a bit coarse a solution and perhaps more expensive than it needs to be.
Approach 2 _almost_ works, and is a more elegant solution but it appears to be fighting something else listening to the invalidation, that is getting it wrong. More research to do here.

If all loaded items are within visible bounds, fetching never triggers because this is triggered by a scroll event. If I have 10 of 100 items loaded, then pinch to zoom a collection view where all 10 fit nicely the trigger to fetch additional items will never get called.

The intention of this is to allow the user of ASVideoNode to set placeholder images independently of the video decoding process. The iOS code doesn't appear to be capable of pulling a placeholder image from an HLS video stream (the video node appears blank until you tap play), and for my project I need placeholders. This also allows the user to set a placeholder that isn't necessarily a frame of the video.

I believe Max and Yunnan (Xinchi / yunnanwu) have been planning to change the superclass of ASVideoNode to ASNetworkImageNode.  Although this may sound nontraditional, it turns out to provide exactly the desired functionality with exceptionally low overhead.

If a user desires a fixed, static asset placeholder image or to apply one themselves, they could set videoNode.image.  If a thumbnail URL, they simply set videoNode.url, which we could mirror to placeholderImageURL or such.  Even the playButton will properly display over the top of the image content, as would the AVPlayerLayer when added.

This should mean that it's not necessary to set .image / .url = nil even to play the video, although we could do so if we decide to (it would save memory, and the PINRemoteImage fully automatic / default-on memory + disk cache should have us covered.

I will be flying out of town in the next day, but will check in by Monday or so.  Please hop on Slack and pull together a few of the contributors to discuss if we should adapt this PR to change the superclass.  If you're interested to just try this out, I think it should be a straightforward change, mostly deleting the placeholderImageNode!

1656,2016-06-04 21:39:09,"@Xinchi I've thought carefully about this and also discussed with @hannahmbanana about API naming.  My original opinion matched @binl and I think there is some question about the flexibility of the original API name.  Your work here matched it perfectly and is correct, it simply exposed some limitations in the flexibility of the original name choice.

However, after further consideration, I think we should move forward with this as-is.  I am likely to want to rename this to something more generic later, like ASCellNodeInterfaceEvent..., but this would be a breaking API change and is not worth doing at this moment (we should consider it for 2.0 though).

In the end, the reason I'm happy to land this is that I definitely agree the functionality is related to the use cases for the other values.  They are all related to a cell monitoring its relationship with the scrollable content area.  It is always possible to solve problems like this at the application level - however, ASDK's main goal is to provide conveniences wherever they don't get in the way / slow things down, specifically to reduce the complexity of application code and make powerful capabilities easy.  Avoiding the need for application level delegate patterns is definitely a simplification.

Thanks for carefully thinking about this, making a very clean change to core framework code, and advocating for why this is the right solution — as well as thinking through alternatives.

If you can rebase it, I'll merge ASAP.

One workaround consists in wrapping the call to `scrollToItemAtIndex` inside an `async_after`, another is to call it after `reloadDataImmediately`.

The first workaround is just an ugly hack, the second is too expensive.  A better and more convenient way to set an ASPagerNode's initial cell would be nice.

- @bimawa: I have only one idea its add property to ASLayoutSpec class. But maybe community can invent better ideas? but like u spot its make a bit less declarative. But from another side its property like `flexShrink` similar props. We can try add this to `ASLayoutable.h` protocol. Call it like `flexVisible` with default propery `YES` and if this property is `NO` skip Spec from calculation in layouts.

We recently made some pretty deep overhauls to PINRemoteImage, in order to add seamless support for Animated GIFs at both the image library and ASDK / UI component level.  I can definitely understand the issue you’re pointing out, and wish we caught it, but am glad you did for us.

These changes were done in a very compressed timeline, and overall I think they were very well architected (protocol setup to ensure that even ASDK can build without PINRemoteImage despite the tight GIF integration), including consideration of future animatable image formats / custom extensions for other image formats.  Nonetheless it is certainly worth another careful look through the cache paths to ensure nothing else was disrupted, but I suspect the fix will be pretty feasible.

@garrettmoon, definitely a good thing to have for 3.0 non-beta (as ASDK is pointing to the Beta right now, even in its production release).  I know it’s a tough time to pull aside cycles to spend on the release, but we should plan out what’s required for 3.0 in the next week and decide the timeline it should be done in (maybe end of month?)

With both ASTableView and ASCollectionView, willBeginBatchFetchWithContext is being called right after viewDidAppear even without any input/touch.

Please, correct me if I'm wrong but this is not the same behaviour as version 1.9.7 and I think that batchFetch is not supposed to be called without a scroll event toward the end of the scrollview.

1631,2016-05-06 21:51:49,"This is actually intentional, provided that the end of the contentSize is within the number of screens for batch fetching.  The previous implementation did not handle a few important cases such as if the initially loaded content didn't have enough space to scroll, it would never load at all.

If you'd like the previous behavior, feel free to set the number to 0 and then make it the desired number of screens ahead for loading once you see the first scrollViewDidBeginScrolling:

If you notice a bug, such as the load being started even when you have a contentSize (determined by items in the data source) big enough to fill the number of screen dimensions below / to the right of the initial, definitely let us know those details and we will aim to fix in the upcoming 1.9.8 release.

Michael, is it possible that for some apps, the first layout batch size might not cover enough size and we trigger a load before allowing the layout batches to finish?  I assume this is fully handled already as I believe your code is using the completion event of all layout from the initial load finishing.

I know that Michael Schneider is familiar with some of the timing considerations in this code, which are not intuitive and affect only certain editing patterns or situation such as memory warnings for freeing of memory upon suspend of the app. There're also a few special considerations with changing the range mode.

I will review this as soon as I can, but unfortunately this Will not be for at least a few days, and it would be helpful to see if anyone else in the community has initial feedback.

1619,2016-05-20 20:08:36,"Great points @maicki! With them in mind, I'm thinking about how to improve this approach. I'm just going to store some thoughts here as I attack this.

### The Goal

We want to update the range controller **synchronously**, just **after** each **batch** of visible node changes is committed.
- _After_ because during `willDisplayCell:` the cell isn't quite setup for the new item (i.e. in the hierarchy, in the lookup tables, at the correct frame) yet, so unexpected behavior (like the indexPathForCell: failing) may occur if we pretend otherwise.
- _Synchronous_ because we want to guarantee that the range state is correct before the next frame is drawn.
- _Batch_ because it's potentially expensive to recalculate the ranges more than once per layout change. **Q** I haven't profiled this yet – it would be good to know the relative cost.

### How UITableView/UICollectionView Change Visible Index Paths

There are three reasons for a visible index paths change:
1. bounds change (scrolling, resizing). 
   - This case is pretty easy to cover. Table view and collection view always perform visible cell changes during `layoutSubviews`.
   - We can simply add a flag like `visibleIndexPathsDidChangeDuringLayoutSubviews`, and check it after `[super layoutSubviews]`.
   - If it's changed, then we tell the range controller to update.
2. A batch of editing operations that intersects the visible area.
3. A single editing operation that intersects the visible area.

### Our Hooks
- `willDisplayCell:` This is called just before a cell is assigned an index path and added into the view. Note that the cell may already be in the view (for some previous item) or it may not.
- `didEndDisplayingCell:` This is called just after a cell is unassigned its index path. Note that the cell may be removed from the view or it may not.
- `super layoutSubviews:` Useful override point.
- `super performBatchUpdates:` Useful override point. UICollectionView synchronously updates visible cells during this, including calls to `willDisplay:` and `didEndDisplaying:`
- `super insert/delete/move/reload:` We call these and I suspect **Q** that collection view & table view synchronously update the visible index paths if these are called outside a batch.

### Other Case: Update Animation End

When a table view (**Q** also collection view?) update animation ends, we may get a `didEndDisplayingCell:` call. This can't be predicted and it's not tied into the UIKit layout passes. Unfortunately, the only case where we get a update animation completion hook is in the UICollectionView batch update case. 

We could expand that hook to cover all updates, if we always wrap isolated update calls (e.g. `insertItemsAtIndexPaths:`) in batch updates but that still leaves us out in the cold for table view updates. As far as I know, there is no table view update animation completion hook.

I'm going to keep playing with this and mulling it over, because it's so valuable and yet so delicate. Feedback/thoughts much appreciated @maicki @appleguy @nguyenhuy 
",Adlai-Holler,nguyenhuy
1619,2016-06-20 18:50:56,"This PR got pretty huge =/. Here's what ended up happening:
- Remove `ASRangeController.scrollDirection` and replace with new data source method `scrollDirectionForRangeController:`
- ASRangeController now exposes 2 update methods `setNeedsUpdate` and `updateIfNeeded`
- setNeedsUpdate sets a flag and (if needed) enqueues an `updateIfNeeded` call onto the main queue
- updateIfNeeded clears the flag and performs the update
- Table and collection view call setNeedsUpdate in willDisplayCell:/didDisplayCell:
- Table and collection view call `updateIfNeeded` after `-layoutSubviews`, after submitting data update operations, and after update animations end (only supported for collection view.)
- Optimize `ASTableView.indexPathsForVisibleNodes:` significantly
- Add conditional code to ASRangeController to log frames that contain multiple range updates.
  - Currently during scrolling we never see this, but we sometimes see 2-5 updates during the same frame when update operations are occurring or when table/collections appear.
  - The code in `-[Collection/Table didMoveToWindow:]` needs scrutiny. Are both calls necessary?
- Move enforcement of cell node neverShowPlaceholders into the cell node's visibility callback, out from willDisplayCell:. This way `ensureDisplay` is called after the cell is already added to the hierarchy, and it also reduces class interdependency.

Notes:
- In -[ASCollectionView layoutSubviews] I had to gate the -updateIfNeeded behind `if (self.window != nil)`. If this isn't present, the client app crashes (~80% reliable) with a collection view data integrity problem under certain conditions. It's a very weird issue, I dug into it a little and bailed because we'll flush the range update in didMoveToWindow anyway.

Questions:
- ASRangeController has a `_rangeIsValid` flag that seems to trigger a re-evaluation of the range states of all nodes when the collection view data is updated. Is that correct? I'm thinking we rename it to avoid confusion between `_rangeIsValid` and the new `_needsRangeUpdate` flag.

This has been tested thoroughly but it's obviously a very significant change to very important code. Sorry for the burden, but I think it'll be worth it! Feel free to meet with me in person as needed. Need review @appleguy @maicki @nguyenhuy

In my original changes to add URL / HLS Video support to the ASVideoNode I had explicit construction from either a URL or an AVAsset. This was because during my testing I had problems with the AVPlayerItem if I tried to construct from an HLS AVURLAsset rather than constructing directly from the URL. I can't remember exactly what the problem was if I'm honest, but it seemed prudent to mirror the construction of the AVPlayerItem in the ASVideoNode interface as this was the underlying tech.

Since the original merge the API for ASVideoNode has been simplified to only take an AVAsset. I assume someone has run into similar problems I had however as looking at the code above the internals have been reverted to creating the AVPlayerItem directly from the URL, except this time the URL is extracted from the AVAsset and the player item is constructed without it.

What this does however is drop the use of the AVURLAsset that the user uses for construction without any warning. If the user constructed the video node with a normal AVAsset then after construction videoNode.playerItem.asset would be the same as videoNode.asset. If the user observed anything in the AVAsset before construction or accessed anything inside videoNode.asset everything would work.

Looking at it now however if the user constructs with an AVURLAsset the asset is dropped. I assume the AVPlayerItem makes a new asset if you construct with the raw URL, so videoNode.playerItem.asset would no longer be the same object as videoNode.asset.

The .asset property is also used throughout the class, i.e.



Looking at where this is called, you can see we're probably generating the placeholder image from the AVAsset that we're no longer using:



Like I say, I'm not sure this is even a bug but it just didn't look ideal so thought I'd raise it for discussion.

1599,2016-04-27 03:25:06,"## Background

Originally [reported in Slack](https://asyncdisplaykit.slack.com/archives/general/p1461569479000382). `ASVideoNode` is blocking the UI thread while it loads metadata. It's hard to notice when using a local file, but it's obvious with a remote file on a poor network. @yichungwang created a [simple project to demonstrate the issue](https://asyncdisplaykit.slack.com/files/daydreamer/F1429JP26/videonodesample.zip) 👏 
## Cause

`AVAsset`'s tracks metadata properties block the calling thread until it the track metadata is known. If the asset is remote, this blocks the thread while waiting on the network.
1.  PR https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/1552 added a call to the `tracks` property on the main thread. 
2.  The changes pulled in from https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/1546 added a call to `tracksWithMediaCharacteristic:` while `_videoLock` is locked.
## Proposed Fix
1.  Restructure `constructPlayerItem` so `tracks` does not need to be checked.
2.  Limit the locking in `imageAtTime`.

The sentence before the code looks correct. I could probably make it more clear that `initWithNode:` is the ASViewController's designated initializer. This is the strategy for using an ASCollectionNode with an ASViewController, but it is also possible to use an ASCollectionNode without managing it with an ASViewController.

1586,2016-05-01 07:16:31,"@alexrmacleod haha, having seen those (very cleanly designed) screenshots, I'm definitely really engaged with helping you figure this out.  It reminds me more than a little of building a highly-optimized cell for Apple's Stocks.app, including the first predecessor design of view-based asynchronous rendering that I made for the chart rendering.  No other first-party app used a similar approach at least through 4.3, and I doubt afterwards :-P.  I'd love to see your app succeed technically and have insanely perfect performance.

However, I think the best way is to simply rebuild the swiping functionality, and we could put it in ASCellNode itself.  Honestly it should not be that hard to take an array of colors and strings for the button types revealed by the drag, right?  Do you have a video of interacting with a few examples of this component, maybe with 1, 2, 3 items etc?

The one problem is that I have a significant time crunch in the next few days.  Still, I could work with either you or someone else from the community to build it within a week (max 1 total day of work including API design and full implementation through testing).

I'm wondering if you would be able to send over the code, dropped into a duplicate of any project in Examples / (you can just do Cmd-D on any folder in examples, rename the folder, and delete any code not necessary to get up and running one ASCellNode in a similar environment to your app where we could test dragging to reveal the menu).

If this sounds OK, you could cut out any data model and any other part of the app, just hardcoding some string values.  If you feel motivated, it would be better to have it as a table with 100-200 items, maybe repeating ~10 stock infos of varying lengths, character sets, etc.  Then I could profile it and make sure scrolling is optimized.

Then, it'd be up to you, but this would actually make a sweet app for examples/ .  Or I can keep the code completely confidential and delete it after our work.

Make sure to ping @maicki, @hannahmbanana and myself for any questions on Slack.  I don't think there's a great route to use MGSwipeTableCell and make very direct use of ASDK though.

@appleguy, @maicki, @hannahmbanana I don’t have a video but I made a gif below. Take note of how when the buttons are exposed on one TableViewCell, you can swipe another TableViewCell and the original TableViewCell with the buttons exposed closes automatically. The same goes for vertical swiping on the UITableView. If there is a button exposed on a swiped TableViewCell the user can still interact with the UITableView by swiping vertically, and the swiped TableViewCell closes automagically.

Also in this [link](https://github.com/MortimerGoro/MGSwipeTableCell) there are more gifs showing what the swipe gestures could look like. I really like the Border transition, Static transition and Drag transition.

1584,2016-04-22 23:08:14,"`waitUntilAllUpdatesAreCommitted` is great! Could we go even further and make a variant that waits until the initial nodes are all measured and inserted as well?

I've got a pager node with 3 tabs, and I'd like to push a VC already jumped to the third tab, but I can't. I add `waitUntilAllUpdatedAreCommitted` in `viewWillAppear` and it has no effect, because `_editingTransactionQueue` is empty but numberOfSections is 0. `viewDidLayoutSubviews` is no help either because my view controller's view is a container that holds the pager inside it. Currently my best option is to async out of `viewWillAppear:` and hope that by then the nodes are ready, else to poll repeatedly and jump as soon as I see `numberOfItemsInSection:` is correct but these aren't ideal.

If it was not this particular assertion, there were other changes intended to protect against zero sized snapshots that are definitely still required. 

I'm not understanding  how this would fix the issue Hannah ran into, though.  If the options has never been set to a non-zero size, and setAnnotations: is called (eg before the view is created, and before layout), we trigger a snapshot.  And it will be zero sized.

How does this address that issue?

Since following the changes that @Adlai-Holler made, there are no code paths possible where options.size can be set to zero (and it's set to 256x256 from MapKit by default)

Hannah's issue wasn't that options.size was zero sized. It was that her code hit this false assert, options.size was never set to zero. If Hannah tries out this fix then I'm certain her issue will be resolved.

Most developers I've worked directly with are using the static library because of its superior performance, so I didn't realize the impact of this.

I would consider it a Cocoapods issue insofar as 1) Cocoapods permits these version numbers with no warning, and they do not cause an issue for static libraries, 2) This issue does not affect Carthage users, to my knowledge, 3) Cocoapods could easily overwrite the framework version in the metadata with any value they want, as it is not used at that stage, especially for 4-digit version numbers that their stack accepts as valid pod versions.

That said, we will push a new version of the framework in the next day or two.  @maicki and I are getting ready for this unplanned release.  We will need to distort the version numbering scheme and use something like 1.9.73 as we have a large amount of material tracked under the 1.9.8, etc releases and GitHub provides no batch editing functionality.  So we will release that as 1.9.80.  Once 2.0 is released, we will resume a strictly 3-number versioning scheme and eliminate the two-digit minor version.  Let me know if you have any better ideas, but this seems like a relatively low-cost fix (annoying, but I think it is less annoying than changing all our release tracking documents and running into 1.9.10)

1515,2016-04-12 07:03:03,"@smyrgl thanks for the report - this is no doubt caused by the large recent change to this code, which we have an improvement for coming tomorrow.  However, I wasn't aware it was causing any bugs, so I will bump 1.9.7.2 to a version that doesn't include this commit.  You can rely on that for the time being.

We're experiencing crashes because of the methodSignatureForSelector: method is called on ASDelegateProxy. Unfortunately we haven't been able to reproduce it. We need to help it along a bit to get into a scenario that will cause that crash. From the stacktrace it looks like the delegate method that UIKit wants to call is scrollViewDidScroll:



The theory is that the delegate proxy returns YES to respondsToSelector:@selector(scrollViewDidScroll:) and then when forwardingTargetForSelector:@selector(scrollViewDidScroll:) is executed the _target instance variable is nil somehow. However I can't trigger it, even with stress testing. I also read about a previous issue that was related to accessibility, but turning that on changes nothing. 

We're using version 1.9.4. Since I can't reproduce it haven't tried updating to newest version. I looked in the changes and didn't seem like there were any direct changes to proxy delegate handling.

So in the hope that anyone has seen this before or got some good ideas, heres a fresh issue on the topic :)

I found issues number #11 and #1017, but I need more clarification on this issue.
I want to be able to detect long presses on a ASCellNode (or ASTextNode) and when one does occur I want to open a UIMenuController.
I found a way doing it in the following manner:
override public func didLoad() {
        super.didLoad()
        let longPressRecognizer = UILongPressGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: Selector(""longPressHappened:""))
        view.addGestureRecognizer(longPressRecognizer)
    }

longPressHappened will open the UIMenuController and by overriding these methods I will close it:

override public func touchesBegan(touches: Set<NSObject>!, withEvent event: UIEvent!) 
override public func touchesEnded(touches: Set<NSObject>!, withEvent event: UIEvent!) 
override public func touchesCancelled(touches: Set<NSObject>!, withEvent event: UIEvent!) 

However, this does not seem as the best approach.

I saw the @appleguy said in issue #1017 the following  - ""I think it is possible to hook up the UIMenuController, though it is not very flexible and so there was some discussion about whether it would be best to build a custom callout bubble (that style of button selector)"" - what is a custom callout bubble? what is style button selector?

Any help with this issue would be appreciated.

1464,2016-03-31 11:18:55,"When @appleguy asked me to check out `PINRemoteImage` in #1447 I understood that ASDK integrates with PINRemoteImage via a cache/downloader class called `ASPINRemoteImageDownloader`.

If you use Cocoapods, the `PIN_REMOTE_IMAGE` preprocessor flag does all the magic and things get compiled in the way that you'd expect. You get a tight integration.

However, when using Carthage you must include PINRemoteImage as a completely separate dependency to AsyncDisplayKit (by design).  Further, `ASPINRemoteImageDownloader.h` is not exposed as a public header, which means you can't just go `#import <AsyncDisplayKit/ASPINRemoteImageDownloader.h>` — the file won't be found.

So the only way to access `ASPINRemoteImageDownloader` at all is to copy its source code straight into your project, which would be managed separately from ASDK. Even then, you need to remove the PIN_REMOTE_IMAGE #if macros and fix some imports if you want it to compile.

This is the best solution right now and I can't help but think it should be handled better somehow.

I think a bit of documentation would be nice, because `ASBasicDownloader/Cache` is really not a sensible option for most apps.

I remember from the NSLondon/NSSpain there's different working ranges — a 'display' range, a 'pre-render' range and a 'network' range. How does this map?

- pre-render range = ?!?#?@#
- network range = `ASLayoutRangeTypeFetchData`

1444,2016-03-28 04:40:13,"@akathrowaway thank you for the detailed post. I have some important things to finish tonight and have not yet had a chance to fully understand all of the details here, but I definitely will do so at my soonest opportunity and really appreciate you taking the time to include the detail.

This framework is not widely tested for usage of nodes outside of some form of container / root element.  the reason is simple... in this configuration, there is no system that will trigger the asynchronous layout for display in advance of the content coming on screen, which essentially guarantees that content will ""flash"".

Could you explain a use case, or an example project that demonstrates one, whether one of the many projects in examples/ (feel free to modify one) or one that you create, that exhibits any inconvenient behavior when using ASCellNode with Table, Collection, or Pager - or using an ASViewController?  Also, I assume you're using the latest version of the framework?

These root container objects handled the responsibility of calling measure, as well as triggering display and proactively managing memory. Feel free to check out the description of these components in the NSSpain talk (sorry it's not the greatest - more docs on the way soon, @lappp9 would you be okay with linking your current version of the first tutorial here?)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY_X7l1g79Q

Anyway, the layout system of this framework is the most different aspect of its design from UIKit, although it is also tightly integrated. I have not actually encountered a case yet (from anyone in the community) that describes the resizing behavior as inconvenient, but this only increases my interest in understanding the use cases where it is problematic, and ensuring that this is not simply due to incomplete adoption of the framework such is lacking a root element. For example, when using a cell node, it is typically extremely convenient to be able to call setNeedsLayout and rely on the overall cell changing height automatically - even inside a table or collection.

It is even customizable whether those layouts should be performed in an animated or non-animated way, And it is also possible to write your layout in such a way that it does not rely on the size of its subnodes to determine its height, So as far as I'm aware of there is complete control over the behavior you want.

All this said, I want to reiterate that the layout system that has been in the framework and widely used for the past nine months is still a very poorly documented despite its high degree of testing and flexibility, which makes it almost impossible to jump into and completely understand the conventions and capabilities. This is one reason why I am so active in the Community and try to help everyone understand the best way to get a lot out of the framework, and why am looking forward to the documentation projects that members of the community have been willing to advance. It is now higher priority for me as certain critical projects in my day job are wrapping up.  I'm sorry for the trouble in understanding this stuff and hope to be able to help.

_AsyncDisplayKit+Debug.h_

@ASDK community - I'm working on a set of debug features to streamline developing performance focused apps with ASDK. It would be awesome if you could try these out, and let me know what's most useful + where it can be improved!
## 1. Visualize ASImageNode.image’s pixel scaling
### Description

This debug feature adds a red text label overlay on the bottom right hand corner of an ASImageNode if (and only if) the image’s size in pixels does not match it’s bounds size in pixels, e.g.

`imageSizeInPixels = image.size * image.scale`
`boundsSizeInPixels = bounds.size * contentsScale`
`scaleFactor = imageSizeInPixels / boundsSizeInPixels`

`if (scaleFactor != 1.0) {`
      `NSString *scaleString = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%.2fx"", scaleFactor];`
      `_debugLabelNode.hidden = NO;`
`}`

This debug feature is useful for **quickly determining if you are (1) downloading and rendering excessive amounts of image data or (2) upscaling a low quality image**. In the screenshot below, you can quickly see that the avatar image is unnecessarily large for it’s bounds size and that the center picture is more optimized, but not perfectly so. If you are using an external data source (such as the 500px API used in the example), it's likely that you won’t be able to get the scaleFactor to exactly 1.0. However, if you control your own endpoint, optimize your API / app to return a correctly sized image!

### Usage

In your AppDelegate, (1) import `AsyncDisplayKit+Debug.h` and (2) at the top of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` enable this feature by adding `[ASImageNode setShouldShowImageScalingOverlay:YES];` Make sure to call this method before initializing any ASImageNodes.
## 2. Visualize tappable areas on ASControlNodes
### Description

This debug feature adds a semi-transparent neon green highlight overlay on any ASControlNodes that have a `target:action:` pair added. The tappable range is defined as the ASControlNode’s frame + its hitTestSlop (UIEdgeInsets used by the ASControlNode to extend it’s tappable range). 

**This debug feature is useful for quickly visualizing an ASControlNode's tappable range.** In the screenshot below, you can quickly see 3 things: (1) The tappable area for the avatar image overlaps the username’s tappable area. In this case, the user avatar image is on top in the view hierarchy and is capturing some touches that should go to the username. (2) It would probably make sense to expand the hitTestSlop for the username to allow the user to more easily hit it. (3) I’ve accidentally set the hitTestSlop’s UIEdgeInsets to be positive instead of negative for the photo likes count label. It’s going to be hard for a user to tap the smaller target.
![screen shot 2016-03-25 at 4 39 23 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3419380/14057034/e1e71450-f2b1-11e5-8091-3e6f22862994.png)
### Usage

In your AppDelegate, (1) import `AsyncDisplayKit+Debug.h` and (2) at the top of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` enable this feature by adding`[ASControlNode setEnableHitTestDebug:YES];` Make sure to call this method before initializing any ASControlNodes (including ASButtonNodes, ASImageNodes, and ASTextNodes).
### Limitations

This only works for ASControlNodes’s with `addTarget:action:` pairs added. **It will not work with gesture recognizers.**
## 3. Visualize ASRangeController tuning parameters - PR #1390
### Description

This debug feature adds a semi-transparent subview in the bottom right hand corner of the sharedApplication keyWindow that visualizes the ASRangeTuningParameters per each ASLayoutRangeType for each visible (on-screen) instance of ASRangeController. 
- The instances of ASRangeController are represented as bars
- As you scroll around within ASTable/CollectionViews you can see the parameters (green = Visible, yellow = Display, and red = FetchData) move relative to each other. 
- White arrows on the L and R sides of the individual RangeController bar views indicate the scrolling direction so that you can determine the leading / trailing tuning parameters (especially useful for vertically-oriented rangeControllers whose leading edge might be unclear within the horizontally-oriented bar view). 
- The white debug label above the RangeController bar displays the RangeController dataSource’s class name to differentiate between nested views.
- The overlay can be moved with a panning gesture in order to see content under it.

This debug feature is useful for highly optimized ASDK apps that require tuning of any ASRangeController. Or for anyone who is curious about how ASRangeControllers work. 

The examples/VerticalWithinHorizontal app picture below contains an ASPagerNode with embedded ASTableViews. In the screenshot with this feature enabled, you can see the two range controllers - ASTableView and ASCollectionView (ASPagerNode) - in the overlay. 
- The white arrows to the right of the rangeController bars indicate that the user is currently scrolling down through the table and right through the ASCollectionView/PagerNode. 
- The ASTableView rangeController bar indicates that the range parameters are tuned to both fetch and decode more data in the downward table direction rather than in the reverse direction (which makes sense as the user is scrolling down). 
- Since it’s less obvious whether or not the user will page to the right or left next, the ASCollectionView is tuned to fetch and decode equal amounts of data in each direction. 
- In the video, you can see as the user scrolls between pages, that new ASTableView rangeControllers are created and removed in the overlay view. 
  ![bc0b98f0-ebb8-11e5-8f50-421cb0f320c2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3419380/14057072/ef7f63a0-f2b2-11e5-92a5-f65b2d207e63.png)
### Video Demo

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1BArZ05bNhzVy1jSW9FeEVXUjg/view
### Usage

In your AppDelegate, (1) import `AsyncDisplayKit+Debug.h` and (2) at the top of `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` enable this feature by adding `[ASRangeController setShouldShowRangeDebugOverlay:YES];` Make sure to call this method before initializing any component that uses an ASRangeControllers (ASTableView, ASCollectionView).
### Limitations
- code performance is iffy
- only shows onscreen ASRangeControllers
- currently the ratio of red (fetch data), yellow (display) and green (visible) are relative to each other, but not between each bar view. So you cannot compare individual bars to eachother
- configure the debug label to display more useful information - perhaps the actual values of the tuning parameters?
- rather than displaying the ideal tuning parameters, show the achieved ones
- rather than showing the tuning parameters in a bar representation, show the actual nodes in each state

1401,2016-03-19 13:44:02,"Hello guys,

I have application based on video content, so there is video player in every corner :smile_cat: 

The whole app except video player is made with AsyncDisplayKit and i want to change this.

We have custom video player, like ASVideoNode and it has a lot of delegate methods, for many cases which we use.

I am trying to implement such thing in `ASVideoNode`, so i forked it and made few changes listed bellow.

It will be super if i can hear some ideas from you. If my changes will be useful and it's not bad what i did, i will continue and at the will make pull request :blush:

Here is [link](https://github.com/Eke/AsyncDisplayKit/commit/d8e752f3fafd697506428199639f49469030a9be) to my `ASVideoNode` branch latest commit, which implements everything listed bellow

Added `ASVideoNodePlayerState` and two delegate methods, `videoNode:willChangePlayerState:toState:` and `videoNode:shouldChangePlayerStateTo:`

 `videoNode:willChangePlayerState:toState:`  notifies delegate that `ASVideoNode` is going to change player state.

`videoNode:shouldChangePlayerStateTo:` asks delegate if `ASVideoNode` should change state to new one. for example in some cases you can disable video pause or play.

In `ASVideoNode` class replaced : 
`[self play]` with `self.playerState = ASVideoNodePlayerStatePlaying;` 
`[self pause]` with `self.playerState = ASVideoNodePlayerStatePaused;`

Added new method `setPlayerState:` which decides must `ASVideoNode` call play or pause methods.

If this changes are ok, must remove public play and pause methods from header file. Must use `setPlayerState:` instead

@appleguy Can you take a look?

1400,2016-04-02 05:44:27,"@eanagel - the reason this assertion exists is because transitions are capable of performing detailed animations and even addition and removal of subnodes at every level of the hierarchy beneath the call point. For obvious reasons, especially considering that the API is thread safe and that the measurement calculations can be easily performed on a background thread simply by calling transition there, it is important to ensure consistency. 

If you could elaborate on your use case, which is probably valid and worth supporting, we can think about the way to support it. The architecture in this area is actually in great shape to modify this behavior, potentially doing something like allowing a subtree that is animating to take precedence over animations of the parent, but we will need to think through certain threading implications.

1387,2016-03-16 10:12:09,"@levi I was testing out the new layoutSpec transitions in my app and was modeling my code off the example you've created for the animated form. However when I come to animateLayoutTransition in my example app, initialFrameForNode and finalFrameForNode return the same value from the supplied ASContextTransitioning.

I was stepping through the code and it looks like when calling transitionLayoutWithSizeRange, the first thing that is done is to iterate through all the subnodes and set the following:



Then immediately following this the newLayout is created, which I assume is the layout that takes into consideration all state changes that have happened and is where finalFrameForNode gets its values. The issue I'm seeing is that the newLayout calls this in the transitionBlock:



But when going through this pass of calculateLayoutThatFits, calling measureWithSizeRange on each subnode does nothing since we have just set the hierarchyState and pendingTransactionID on each subnode. So measureWithSizeRange fails when checking:



So my question is am I doing something wrong here or should measureWithSizeRange always perform a measurement in the case where it is called in calculateLayoutThatFits via transitionLayoutWithAnimation?

I've attached the code for a test app I created just to show just this one example. If you or anyone else has a moment to take a look that'd be awesome, maybe something will stand out for you that I'm just missing. Either way I appreciate any help I can get!

1368,2016-04-30 00:02:39,"@wpK I think your layout is totally fine. It's just the text node laying (we use internally Core Text) out your text this way as you have a sample text with very long words and wrapping it the right way is kind of complicated and so 

Just set your sample text to something different and I think you will have the right representation (look into the gist, you can also add some more character and you will see it)

Furthermore you don't need to wrap the layout in a static layout spec too :)

Here is a new gist: https://gist.github.com/maicki/f7e53bc4c93651c73b7faeb3f3d7afb5

Let me know if we understand it right what you wanna have. Maybe a more extended sample project would help that show's in what problems you are run into.

1367,2016-03-17 04:41:53,"@binl thank you for proposing this. You definitely discovered a real, important issue that was caused by very recent changes related to triggering range updates upon a table / collection moving into or out of a window. In addition to the memory footprint, this was causing back to back calls to visibilityDidChange: separated by just one run loop turn, and although the state always ended up correct, this extra thrash was both inefficient and potentially a problem for certain implementations that might not check to filter out noisy calls.

I feel it is very important to continue to observe this behavior to ensure that we are addressing any root causes of these kind of unnecessary calls, and believe that the system is now behaving in a significantly more calm and efficient way after https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/1382 .  If we find more causes, we should revisit to see if they have as concrete of a solution as was possible in that change.

That said, I would not be to surprise if we end up reopening this change and going in this direction. Overall, the range mode API is very new and Will not B production API for at least another month, possibly more. So we do have sometime to continue to inspect the behavior of the system in a variety of complex circumstances, and this change should continue to apply smoothly if we reopen the PR (no need to create a new one since it's so easy to reopen).

Give the new behavior a try, and let me know which scenarios are still producing noisy calls. I am nearly certain that there are at least a handful of cases that do so, potentially with very significant negative impact, and would be very motivated to start digging into why they happen.

Lastly, I am thrilled to see this new pull request from @hannahmbanana - it allows it visualizing the current range controllers in the system, which will dramatically assist in detecting these kind of problems. It is still a fairly rough implementation, but already amazingly useful, and can be expanded and improved as we learn which capabilities are most valuable.  https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/1390

Here is the current state of ASDK on tvOS in my opinion (after this PR):
- ASControlNode. The base class has 95% focus engine support. This is basically complete all for the fact that currently I wasn't able to find a way to receive a long press event (gesture recognizer didn't work). So the default behaviour of being able to hold down a control node and cause it to be 'impressed' into the UI isn't supported.
- ASImageNode. This has about 25% focus engine support. This is a lot trickier and would love some of community to help out on this. The built in effects of UIImageView when `.adjustsImageWhenAncestorFocused = YES` are gorgeous and would need to be replicated in order to use it in production. Also sometimes the focus engine effects aren't escaped properly (in the current implementation)
- Since PINRemoteImage is now a subspec of ASDK then we will need to enable tvOS support for that project too, but I doubt that this would be very hard, maybe @garrettmoon has more info on this? Happy to do this piece of work in a new PR.

Once ASImageNode is complete then the next piece of work would be to make it work inside a ASCellNode for use with ASCollection/TableView. That would be mostly it, in my opinion. So not huge amounts of work but just need to perfect certain aspects of ASDK in order for it to be truly viable.

Obviously other nodes will need to be tested when we get to that but once these points are done then I'd be confident with moving ahead. Otherwise I might have to reside to use UICollectionView's with UICollectionViewCells and UIImageView's and only use ASDK for sub views which wouldn't be that great!

Once ASImageNode is complete then the next piece of work would be to make it work inside a ASCellNode for use with ASCollection/TableView. That would be mostly it, in my opinion. So not huge amounts of work but just need to perfect certain aspects of ASDK in order for it to be truly viable.

Obviously other nodes will need to be tested when we get to that but once these points are done then I'd be confident with moving ahead.

1273,2016-02-25 09:39:10,"Hi @appleguy, apologies for not being as involved lately but have finally gotten some good time for tvOS support. 

Here is the current state of ASDK on tvOS in my opinion (after this PR):
- ASControlNode. The base class has 95% focus engine support. This is basically complete all for the fact that currently I wasn't able to find a way to receive a long press event (gesture recognizer didn't work). So the default behaviour of being able to hold down a control node and cause it to be 'impressed' into the UI isn't supported.
- ASImageNode. This has about 25% focus engine support. This is a lot trickier and would love some of community to help out on this. The built in effects of UIImageView when `.adjustsImageWhenAncestorFocused = YES` are gorgeous and would need to be replicated in order to use it in production.

1208,2016-02-11 08:49:05,"@smyrgl thanks for the information!  It definitely helps clarify the issue.

Locking overhead is one of the most measurable parts of AsyncDisplayKit on the main thread with app architectures that minimize their own usage of main.  That said, the deadlock I mentioned in the commit log was obviously the prompt to investigate the change, which is far as I can tell does not compromise thread safety.

It is very complex to use Core Data in an app with multithreaded UI. This was experience in the main Facebook app with its architecture before ASDK & ComponentKit.  It was also experienced when building the Paper app which was based on Core Data for the first year of its development until it was ported off of it before launch.

The framework is one of the best in the world for dealing with certain types of data sets, and is also used by one of the very best contributors to the project (@Adlai-Holler).  Fortunately, the source of the deadlock can be very easily understood based on the AsyncDisplayKit threading model. Unfortunately, there is no documentation written about this.  The three part tutorial series from Ray Wenderlich may have an opportunity to cover this in the third tutorial, but I will definitely make sure it is added to the website documentation in the next couple months.

Specifically, the framework requires that background threads never synchronously wait on the main thread. The main thread is allowed to synchronously wait on any background thread, As this is necessary in a variety of URI timing sensitive operations that desire explicitly synchronous layout or display.

I think it would be very interesting to discuss this with anyone in the community who has better experience with Core Data than I do, as I am a couple years out of date (and ASDK itself was different then).  One thing that we'll almost certainly help your app architecture overcome this in a reliable and graceful way is the change from @Adlai-Holler (surprise!) That he is planning to finish in the next few days, in order to remove thread affinity assertions and oh allow even UIKit and CA bridge properties to be set in the background (even after isNodeLoaded).

It will not facilitate reading the values of /bridged/ properties in that same situation, but this is very rare and almost always possible to work around easily.  Reading is possible from all ASDK properties like attributedString, URL, image, are expected by the framework to be threadsafe (locking is practiced quite consistently in the framework, though some ~20% may need auditing - these cases are almost inconceivable to use in a concurrent way).

Thanks for your email, really glad to be in touch with you and excited to find a solution together!

1207,2016-02-10 02:35:50,"Thank you for bringing this up! This is hugely important. I like this change, but I believe we need to map the reloaded indexes to their after-the-update values. The indexes the user provides us for reloads are before-the-update indexes, so as soon as we process any inserts/deletes, those indexes are invalid.

_ASHierarchyChangeSet already has `newSectionForOldSection` so what we need to do is write a corresponding `newIndexPathForOldIndexPath` method. Then use those methods to map all the reloaded indexes/paths to their new values, and then call `[super reload…]` using those new indexes.

`newIndexPathForOldIndexPath` is a medium-difficulty task, if we want it to be efficient.

The first part is easy – use newSectionForOldSection to see what new section the item corresponds to. This should never return `NSNotFound` because we filter out reloads that target inserted/reloaded sections.

The harder part is, we need to compute a pair of NSIndexSets for each section that was modified, and just like in `newSectionForOldSection`, we'll use two calls to `countOfIndexesInRange` to compute the new item index, reading the deletes from the old section and inserts from the new one.

Here's an example implementation:



Also, we need to fix the implementation of `newSectionForOldSection` because as I look at it, I see it uses `[_insertedSections countOfIndexesInRange:]` to do inserts, which isn't safe because of the way a prior insert can make a later insert affect the given item. That newSectionForOldSection should compute the new section using the same method I showed above, with `enumerateIndexesUsingBlock`. 

Are you up for handling this? I can absolutely answer any questions or trouble you encounter but I'm a bit bandwidth-limited right now. Also @appleguy should take a looky-loo.

If either of you could put up a diff, (and fix that open brace too!), I definitely don't think this is a reasonable behavior.

Not that we should be optimizing for a no cache case, but the only reasonable thing I can imagine doing would be to expand the fetch data range so we keep Data a bit longer... But this is not something we should worry about right now,

1204,2016-02-08 23:33:54,"Hey @secretiverhyme, I was trying to update the documentation on the .org site but I'm running into some problems. 

What I tried to do was checking out the gh-pages branch, adding a page to it, and then pushing it back out.  When I do that I get an email from github saying that the build of my pages failed due to symlinks not existing.  

Is this the right way to go about editing the documentation or is there a better way?  I notice if you click [edit] on one of the pages it takes you do the markdown files in the /doc folder on the master branch.  Is editing these files the actual way to update the documentation?

I've never really used jekyll or gh-pages so I could be totally missing something simple!

In my opinion, in validating the collection review layout itself is too expensive to do every frame, although I know it is a relatively common practice. Once you were doing this, it is actually quite cheap in comparison to reload the item at the index Path being manipulated. Have you tried doing this?

Go ahead and also try calling -setNeedsLayout on the ASCellNode at that in next path. I believe this is set up to re-request the constrainedSizeForNodeAtIndexPath: from the data source.  cc @nguyenhuy who can correct me if this is wrong.

",aaronschubert0,JoSpalding
1138,2016-01-29 23:54:36,"@JoSpalding it turns out the solution you created is the most efficient way to do this.  If we made the text node itself large enough to draw its background color in that larger rectangle, we would have to allocate a larger backing store and draw the pixels using the CPU. Your solution is better in that a view or node that has a background color set on it does not actually allocate /any/ backing store, or do any drawing, but rather is used by a hint in the compositor to have the GPU very efficiently applying that color in that area.

You can't get both drawing and the free backgroundColor on the same layer / view / node object due to the limitations of the iOS system.

So although it would be nice to support this in ASTextNode itself, it can't be done very easily without adding an additional overhead for text nodes that don't require it, namely an extra level in the hierarchy with extra views required.

It would be possible to do something like only add the additional of view when it is needed, but this would require more extensive rearchitecting to remove all of the logic out of the text note class itself, and have some way of both drawing directly in a single node, or containing that drawing to a sub node if we need to expand the background color.

If you would like to think of a nice name for your bordered color text component, I would be open to including it in the framework! Out of curiosity, can you explain your use case for this a little bit more?

Finally I noticed the SocialAppLayout uses ASControlNode for the buttons... why is that.... you guys built ASButtonNode? what are the benefits of using one over the other?

1121,2016-01-26 21:54:18,"Hey @levi 

I am seeing a bug with ASPagerNode that i believes stems from it's use of the `rangeController`, `ASDisplayNode::setInterfaceState` and this line: `ASRangeTuningParameters renderParams = { .leadingBufferScreenfuls = 1.0, .trailingBufferScreenfuls = 1.0 };`

When a pager has more than 3 pages, when viewing pages +2 or -2 away, `+drawRect` does not get called on any of the pager's subnodes.

It seems like when `setInterfaceState` turns on the display and `[self setDisplaySuspended:NO];` is called, the `setDisplaySuspended` function breaks on this line.
![screen shot 2016-01-26 at 12 24 15 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3641335/12593847/ff076660-c427-11e5-8caa-e43b0f359074.png)
which seems to indicate that displaySuspended gets set to 0 somehow.

lemme know if you need more details and/or would like me to create a sample project and thank you in advance!

Truncated should be initialized ahead of size calculation so it can actually truncate string in it's initializer.

I'm particularly bummed about creating all the index paths - I think we could make an alternate codepath that iterates over the nodes themselves, keeping a local integer of section and item number, doing something like the multidimensional helper function does internally by building up the index path by index - but not having to create a full array of them.  This might not help efficiency much, though it would also eliminate accessing the nodes out of the 2D array.
",appleguy,knopp
1105,2016-01-25 13:07:03,"I hear you, but in the end, you still need to check
fetchDataIndexPaths, displayIndexPaths and visibleIndexPaths, and you need
NSIndexPaths for that, don’t you? And you need to do it for every single
item. But with separate code path you could maybe at least
avoid NSMutableOrderedSet overhead, which miight not be small if you have
thousands of index paths.

<img width=""1119"" alt=""screen shot 2016-01-20 at 6 47 04 pm"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3641335/12470094/3f55c74c-bfa6-11e5-9479-65ecd09414c9.png"">

retaining the modification block in my own class does fix this problem:



as does removing the `nullable` attribute in `imageModificationBlock`
`@property (nonatomic, readwrite, copy) asimagenode_modification_block_t imageModificationBlock;`

its possible that this is a swift/obj-c bridge error, but i can't track the source of the problem. it might just be a simple objective-c bug that i'm having trouble tracking down. thoughts?

I took a diff late in the release for ASRangeController, and should not have done so.  1.9.5 does resolve all the reported stability issues with 1.9.4, and overall is a small and conservative release that is very unlikely to regress anything further, so I'm glad you've adopted it.  Remember, you can email me directly at asyncdisplaykit@gmail.com any time, especially for something as terrible as a stability issue that blocks your adoption of a release.

Are you using ASPagerNode and ASTableNodes inside that?  If you do this, you will see very substantial performance improvements for your use case, because of the smart 2D preloading feature.

1071,2016-01-16 21:01:06,"So I was trying to convert some of my manual layout code to layout specs and I can't seem to figure out a good way to get my collection view headers to be the right size.  It seems like it should be really easy but I can't quite get it there.  The problem in my mind, is that I don't see a place to specify the size range for the layout spec.  Since the min is {0, 0} and the max is {375, 45} I'm getting a bar that only fills up half the width since the buttons are only so big.  Is there a way to get the stack layout to expand to take the entire width or a way to just specify the min and max for a collection views supplementary view? @nguyenhuy ?

",lappp9,nguyenhuy
1071,2016-01-17 17:33:51,"Sure, happy to help. 

The first thing to do (and seems like the missing piece here) is to tell the stack to fill the entire width available. There are a few ways that I can think of to achieve this:
1. Return a fixed constrained width (min width equals max width) via `-collectionView:constrainedSizeForSupplementaryNodeOfKind:atIndexPath:`. This method is defined by `ASCollectionViewLayoutInspecting` protocol. I honestly haven't played around with collection view inspector and so don't know off the top of my head where to implement/override this method. @levi must know though.
2. Wrap the entire stack inside a static spec, and assign to the stack a size range that has an exact 100% width. This way, even the constrained size given to the supplementary node has a min of {0, 0}, the stack will still be required to expand.
3. As a general tip, if you have a horizontal stack inside a vertical stack, make sure to set the horizontal stack's `alignSelf` property to `ASStackLayoutAlignSelfStretch`.

As soon as the stack is required to fill the entire width, it will try to figure out how to eat up that much space. Since none of the buttons can grow, justifyContent will be considered. I think you will use either ""space between"" or ""space around"", probably the former. You also may need to set `spacingBefore` for the first button and `spacingAfter` for the last button, or to wrap the stack inside an inset spec.

Let me know if this helps!

1059,2016-01-13 10:47:33,"This is currently WIP but I wanted to issue a PR to start a discussion about how to best support tvOS. My initial findings are that it is relatively easy to make ASDK build on tvOS and further more expose the relevant methods (`UIFocusEnvironment` Protocol) that are needed to lay the foundation of tvOS support, as witnessed by this PR.

The **main** work is making all the nodes in ASDK respond to the UIFocus Engine. I am in favour of having a default behaviour implementation on ASDisplayNode that is then inherited by all other nodes. This will ensure that all nodes have a basic behaviour, which can then be overridden to provide a better experience.

Once the default behaviour approach is decided, the second decision to be made is who's responsibility it is to provide great UIFocus behaviour? Would it be the author of that certain node or would someone provide a coherent experience across all the nodes? I'm wanting to implement a tvOS app at work soon using ASDK, so I'm happy to provide a heavy lift to support these efforts, especially for ASImageNode which has the most work to do to match the focus behaviour of UIImageView. Having said that, it could be faster, and/or favoured by the community to implement their own behaviours. 

Another aspect is that the design of the tvOS UI is counter-culture to what has been recommended for ASDK, mainly when items are in focus. tvOS makes heavy use of rounded corners and drop shadows, which ASDK has traditionally (for performance reasons) been strongly against.

A number of nodes are currently affected by a lack of certain properties/frameworks in tvOS, I need to do more research to fully determine these aspects but here is the initial list:
- `ASEditableTextNode`. UITextView.editable isn't currently available on tvOS, therefore undermining the purpose of this node.
-  `ASMapNode`. MapKit isn't available on tvOS 9.0 but _is_ available on tvOS 9.2, so this isn't a big deal currently.
- `ASMultiplexImageNode`. The Photos and AssetsLibrary frameworks aren't available on tvOS so ASMultiplexImageNode is currently relegated to only displaying URL's from the web (which is probably the biggest use case, but still)
- `ASPagerNode`. UICollectionView.pagingEnabled & .scrollsToTop properties aren't available on tvOS, I suspect this is due a new mechanism for paging tvOS, so maybe this node can be adapted for this. cc @levi 
- `ASTableViewProtocols`. UITableViewRowAction is not available on tvOS. I have currently only gated the method that highlights this (for Swift support) but further investigation is needed to see if UITableViews are editable at all.

There are still a number of things to test and to-do to fully lay the ground work. I have only tested this with CocoaPods (which works). There are the things still to test/to-do, which I will update, as I come across additional items:
- [ ] Provide a static tvOS framework build
- [ ] Thoroughly test each node's behaviour 
- [ ] Provide a tvOS example app, similar to UIKitCatalog to showcase all of ASDK's nodes in a tvOS environment

1057,2016-01-19 05:17:10,"@Cabus thanks for asking about this.  This is almost certainly on the cusp of working, but not quite there.  I have actually never tried an animated layout change, and neither has anyone asked me about it, which is pretty surprising...but for that reason we probably need a few lines of changes within the framework.

Example causes might be:
- We need to ensure all of the cells have calculated their new layout in order to animate; this may have to be forced to occur synchronously.  Good news is we have facilities to block the main thread on a concurrent background operation, so this should literally double performance compared to UIKit normally.
- itemSize is not fully integrated with the layout system, because it is not as expressive / well-integrated with the layout system as constrainedSize is.  It's also trapped by the non-threadsafe UICollectionViewLayout object :).  That said, this really is a bug / limitation more than anything else: particularly if constrainedSizeForItemAtIndexPath: is not implemented, we should be using itemSize.  I think there might already be some code to do this, but it hasn't been rigorously tested, and we might need something like an invalidateLayout call when itemSize changes etc.

@levi are you familiar with collection view animations?  I'm wondering if you could audit the code for issues in the area of fixed itemSize and animations / transitions, just to highlight what areas might need work, even if you don't have time to make the change.

1048,2016-01-08 07:53:22,"Yo @appleguy here's something pretty neat. Let me know what you think!
- Optimize `_ASPendingState` by removing unneeded sets, and by loading all flags at once before doing batch comparisons.
- Add `ASWeakSet` that is built on top of `NSMapTable`. This does not support ordering, so if it's valuable to be able to flush nodes in the order that they were dirtied, we can change the approach to be built on top of `NSMutableOrderedSet` but it'll be a little less pleasant.
- Add `ASPendingStateController` singleton that keeps a weak set of dirty nodes and flushes them at the end of each turn of the run loop. You can also flush it manually at any time from the main queue (obviously if you want to flush from the background, just use `dispatch`.) It does not yet support dividing the work up into chunks. It'd be easy enough to only handle max N nodes per pass but I wanted to wait for your comments before diving into that optimization.
- Modify `ASDisplayNode` to always have a pending state. It no longer discards the pending state after node is loaded; instead it just clears the pending state's flags.
- Modify display node's `UIViewBridging` category to:
  - Always read properties from `ASPendingState`.
  - Always write properties to `ASPendingState`.
  - If properties are modified on main and node is loaded, properties are immediately propagated to view/layer.
  - If node is not dirty, but is loaded, and a bridged property is set off-main, we register the node with the pending state controller. Note that we register it before updating the pending state, but this is safe because we hold the node's property lock during this time and pending states can't be applied until lock is relinquished. 

I'm using `performSelectorOnMainThread:withObject:waitUntilDone:inModes` to schedule the run loop flush event, and it works well even when the change originated from an async dispatch onto a global concurrent queue. The docs are a little confusing here though – it mentions at one point that it dispatches onto ""the run loop of the main thread"" and then later that it registers with ""the runloop of its current context"". I can definitely swap it out with an `NSTimer` of duration 0 to act as the run loop observer but it's a bit less direct. Thoughts?

TODO:
- [x] Add more tests for the pending state controller.
- [x] Talk about back-propagation i.e. if user sets property on view/layer, what do we do? Only API-safe way to know about it is to swizzle UIView/CALayer properties which is a non-starter.
- [x] Talk about run loop amortization as an optimization.
- [x] Figure out why bridging `backgroundColor` won't work. I've tried migrating ASPendingState over to `UIColor *backgroundColor` but no dice. It's probably something stupid.

1048,2016-02-18 04:32:06,"@appleguy Progress report: I've added a demo project to test the thread affinitylessness and resolved more issues. The demo app works well but I've got two issues remaining:

#### Layout Transitions

Running layout transition animations from the background doesn't work. The current issue is the implicit hierarchy management. After we make that thread-safe we'll need to (sometimes) asynchronously jump to the main thread to run the actual animation. That should be easy, although defining (and capturing) the ""correct"" initial/final animation could take a little thinking.

#### `setFrame:`

Bridging setFrame is troublesome. The current implementation works and maintains the old behavior very well, but there's duplicated code between ASDisplayNode and ASPendingState, and without thread affinity, there are order of operation edge cases – if I set frame then set bounds on a synchronous wrapper node, we should apply the update in the same order.

There are two modes for setting the frame on a node – synchronous wrapper nodes like ASTableNode need to receive setFrame: intact. For all other nodes, we prefer setting bounds and position so that the node's transform doesn't invalidate the frame. The problem is, we can't decompose a frame into bounds/position without reading the current bounds & anchorPoint, which we can't do in the background.

Currently the solution is to wait to decompose the new frame until `pendingViewState applyToView:`, which is working well but results in some extra code for ASPendingState to encapsulate the same logic.

I have some free time tonight and decided to port it to ASDK's layout system. After some hours of banging the keyboard (and trying to learn JS), I think the port is in a good shape. Please try it out here: http://nguyenhuy.github.io/froggy-asdk-layout/ and let me know what you think!

I know that @lappp9 is working on new documentation for the layout system, which is tremendously helpful and greatly appreciated. Hopefully this little game provides some value to the community and helps new developers to learn ASStackLayoutSpec faster!

I'm still not sure about whether I should make a PR to merge the whole game to ASDK's gh-pages branch, or to add a link somewhere in the documentation. Let me know your thoughts :)

1034,2016-01-04 18:09:03,"@appleguy, it seems that the way `ASRangeControllerBeta` works is that it takes union of FetchData, Display and Visible index paths and updates each node in the set. However when scrollToItemAtIndexPath is used, nodes that were previously visible might not be part of the set (because they are too far, and not even members of FetchData set) and thus retain old interface state, even though they are no longer visible.

I understand that the idea is that the range controller doesn't keep any unnecessary state, but it doesn't seem to be very reliable when jumping further than range tuning parameters for fetch data.

One possible solution would be to set _scrollDirection = 0 on collectionView when manually jumping to an offset (or using scrollToIndexPath, etc) and then refresh nodes at all existing indexPaths in `_updateVisibleNodeIndexPaths`.

That logic was indeed changed late in the release (cc @knopp)  Unfortunately I don't have a test case that can trigger this issue, making it very difficult to fix without simply reverting the change (which itself addresses a known, reproducible issue).

One option you may want to try is the new ASRangeControllerBeta.  It is significantly improved and is available if you import ASDisplayNode+Beta.h, and call [ASDisplayNode setShouldUseNewRenderingRange:YES];

I have been using this by default for the internal / development version of Pinterest, and so far it is working very well.  However, it is changing rapidly and not widely tested yet, so you may experience some issues with that as well.

I want to make sure this is supported for all ASCellNodes before it is delivered in a production release.  I investigated supporting it in ASCollectionView and ran into some concerns with how the frames are set on the node (they are not necessarily equal to the size of the item cell, yet are at a 0, 0 position that can't be controlled by the engineer).  This could cause regressions for some apps where the touch target becomes smaller than they desire / currently experience.

I think the right fix for this could be to use ASControlNode or similar inside the ASCellNode, rather than relying on the UITableView or UICollectionView tap delegate methods responding only to an area that is smaller than the UIKit component actually is.  That said, I'm still open to doing this, but it needs to be approached holistically by making sure it works reliably for all the ASCellNode use cases.

I'm happy to say that another community member, @lappp9, is starting a huge push on updating the website and the documentation for 2.0 (note the 1.9.x releases contain most of the features that 2.0 will, but has not GM'd due to the lack of documentation).

Our strategy regarding Swift, briefly, is as follows:
- We're now actively listening to the Swift community for feedback on the API design and what improvements can be made; some of our top contributors are are using Swift in their day jobs.
- The new, redesigned example app that the 2.0 programming guide will walk through will be written with both Objective-C and Swift (although, the initial version will start with Objective-C).
- The site will include an inline switcher for each code snippet to toggle between the languages.
- In 6-12 months, we'll likely be Swift-first for example apps and documentation changes, with back-ports to Objective-C continuing for a couple years.  Usage within the framework will probably start around this time, especially if 3.0 means the runtime won't need to be bundled in each app.

Considering the extreme lack of documentation for rather powerful APIs like ASLayoutSpec, don't hesitate to reach out with any feedback or questions — I'd sincerely enjoy talking to you about it!  I can give you my iMessage number if you email asyncdisplaykit@gmail.com.

1009,2015-12-28 20:35:56,"@appleguy This is a first-pass implementation, I'm not satisfied with it for a number of reasons, and I don't expect to merge it. But this will get the ball rolling and hopefully expose important questions. 

The major problems I have with this branch are:
- If the user directly sets properties on the underlying view, we won't find out about it. If they read the corresponding node property, we'll return the old value. This is a tough problem, because we HAVE to buffer property values outside the view to make them readable from any thread. I can't see any solution to this except swizzling the UIKit setters :scream:.
- Order-of-operations is not preserved. If you're in the middle of buffering main-queue commands on thread A and you set a property to X, and then on thread B (while not in a transaction) you set it to Y, and then A flushes the main queue command buffer, the property will get set to X when it should be Y. What's worse, the pending-state value and the view-value will be out-of-sync. This one shouldn't be hard to solve – we should always store the pending value in the pending state, and then always flush THAT rather than just enqueuing individual property sets.
- Related to above, hard to debug since we don't explicitly track the pending state of a node (in fact, such a state barely exists).

For the next pass here's the plan:
- Construct a ""weak set"" using a weak-to-strong-objects NSMapTable that goes `ASDisplayNode : [NSNull null]`. 
- Create a singleton that has a weak set of nodes that have pending state. When you set a bridged node property off-main on a loaded node, if the pending state was previously empty, we add this node into that set. 
- For setting 
- For the flush, the singleton just calls `applyToView:` or `applyToLayer:` on all the dirty nodes' pending states.
- For transactionalization, I think all we need is to ensure that there are no open transactions when the flush happens, right?
  - Let's say we have four background threads A, B, C, and D:
  - Thread A opens a transaction and starts setting some properties.
  - Thread B opens a transaction and starts setting some properties.
  - Thread C sets a property outside any transaction.
  - Thread A's transaction ends.
  - Thread B's transaction ends.
  - We notice there are no transactions and no flush enqueued. Enqueue a flush on the main thread.
  - Thread D opens a transaction.
  - Main thread: it's time to flush. Lock the singleton (@appleguy dangerous?). But oh! There's an open transaction. Reject flush.
  - Thread D closes its transaction.
  - We notice there are no transactions and no flush enqueued. Enqueue a flush on the main thread.
  - Main thread: it's time to flush. Lock the singleton, confirm no open transactions, let's do this. Apply all pending states to nodes in weak set, empty the set, unlock the singleton.
  - Would it be valuable to have an option to tell the singleton ""flush everything NOW"" on the main thread? 
    I think this would be doable if we accept that the flush may get rejected. Maybe something like `flushChangesWithCompletion:^{}`, so we can wait for any open transactions to end?

Maybe I'm making this way more complicated than it needs to be.

1009,2015-12-29 03:08:41,"Woah, thanks @Adlai-Holler!!  Even just getting this started is **huge**.  I have a handful of comparably risky / ambitious changes planned for right after 1.9.4 is cut (any day now, for reals :) ), and will keep running Pinterest internal against the latest to get us fairly substantial test coverage on these things.  @lappp9 has the programming guide / 2.0 documentation underway, and we plan to add more tests soon too.

We should catch up soon about one of the most important use cases in the framework: ASDataController / ASRangeController and its possible successors / improvements.  Most relevant to this, I want to remove the current checks for isNodeLoaded doing main thread measurement, and I also want things like reloadSection to first process the new state and then apply the updates rather than deleting the existing one initially and then adding the replacement when it's done.

Somewhat more tangentially, there's also my upcoming change to support a ""cellNodeBlock"" so that the block can capture call-time data state and yet be used to allocate the cell node on a background thread, along with the allocation range / measurement range / virtualization stuff we discussed (in service of the need to measure only slightly more than is required to populate a given rect, allowing more liberal use of synchronously preparing those areas).

But lastly and also relevant to the idea of a transactional system we might expand here, there is the increasingly-essential (for my use cases at least) concept of transparent ""runloop amortization"", where the materialization of views and layers is spread out over multiple runloop turns to allow the system opportunities to service display link timers (physics-based animations) or gestures or network callbacks.  This is tricky because it will also involve applying the properties to those views and we can't allow the sub-hierarchy onscreen until it is fully materialized, even if a later call does force it to be.  It will be most useful when the ASRangeController has a cell node entering the display range, or a view controller wants to pre-load its contents, but once the cell is visible or the controller is being presented it is too late to use this technique (unlike synchronous concurrency, which blocks main on a concurrent background operation).  So we will need the ability to force-finish in one runloop an operation that is in the process of being amortized across multiple loops, and that's where waiting on a transaction type setup (calling ""run"" or ""finish"" on the transaction, perhaps, if the contents of that transaction is responsible for poking the view / layer and applying pending state).

Rambling complete, I'm now leaving the Chipotle in Central California (Grapevine, CA) to continue the drive home to SoCal :).  Hope to see you again soon - I'll be online and working for the next week if you want to talk by FaceTime Audio about this.  Thanks for the delightful surprise and ideas to think about on the drive!

1001,2015-12-27 00:57:49,"This is because ASLayoutOptionsPrivate.mm implements a #define that forwards the setter / getter methods for AS*Layoutable properties to an internal ASLayoutOptions object, used as an override point for complex apps that need to piggyback information through the layout system.

The ASLayoutOptions architecture is useful, but the user experience is disastrous, as it is very important that these properties can be researched by developers new to AsyncDisplayKit when exploring example apps or a large codebase written with it.  This is true because the ASLayoutable suite of properties is arguably the most substantial API surface unique to ASDK / not part of UIKit, and has some of the deepest / most subtle behavior (being what drives the behavior of ASLayoutSpec).

I'm not sure what we can do to essentially trick the compiler into going to ASLayoutSpec.h instead, but hopefully there is a crafty way to do so!  @lappp9, you might consider investigating this as one of the highest value documentation contributions.

977,2016-03-20 05:53:50,"@zintus thank goodness, the new threading model has been landed for a while now and has proven to be quite stable even with extensive usage!

Although I am not certain if this is 100% supported yet, in the very very near future it should be possible to have even loaded no it hierarchies be measured off the main thread by ASDataController.  In fact, we are using this capability in Pinterest - asynchronous measurement of loaded node hierarchies, with an animated transition being triggered at the moment that the measurement completes. This system has been constructed with thread safety front and center, so that even a call to -setNeedsLayout in the middle of the asynchronous measurement phase or the transition itself is handled consistently.

That support is relatively new, although also enjoying widespread use in a very stressful use case at Pinterest (multiple calls to -transition potentially before the prior finishes, due to various updates coming in to the underlying app / server data model).  The one part that I am not as certain of is, if the transition API is not use directly as is the case for the data controller, can we remove the support for main thread layout of loaded nodes?

@nguyenhuy wouldn't know the answer to this question, and although it Would take us at least a couple weeks to investigate, I think that will be the ultimate fix here...rather than supporting more easily creating dual-path code intending to support the previous, rather frustrating threading model.

Just as a quick note, it is still not thread safe to read properties that are bridged to the system objects off of the main thread, after the backing system objects are created. There is no plan to support this in the near future, although it might be possible with further sophistication in the pending state... The reason is that in my many years of using this framework, I have found that it is always quite easy to avoid relying on this capability.  Paper had a write-from-background threading model supported in its version of the framework, but I was always able to ensure that Reading from the background was avoided by providing other facilities (e.g. instead of self.bounds, look at constrainedSize).

973,2015-12-22 18:10:17,"After a quick debugging, it turns out that you need to have a separate inspector class, because both `ASCollectionViewLayoutInspecting` and `ASCollectionViewDataSource` protocols declare `collectionView:constrainedSizeForNodeAtIndexPath:`. So if a class conforms to both protocols and provides a zero constrained size, that size will be picked up by `ASCollectionView` ([code](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/937b72b64a01d1735052e8b49acf73959b4d3844/AsyncDisplayKit/ASCollectionView.mm#L671)) and thus all cell nodes will be measured using the invalid size.

@levi Is there anything we can do to avoid this kind of mistake? Like having `ASCollectionViewLayoutInspecting` to require a method with a slightly different signature?

@fatuhoku You may want to take a look at the `MosaicCollectionViewLayout` in CustomCollectionView example. It produces a Pinterest-like layout that is pretty close to what you are trying to achieve with `SelfSizingWaterfallCollectionViewLayout`. For difficulties building a custom collection view layout, definitely ask @levi. He is the expert :)

955,2015-12-22 05:13:15,"@smyrgl update on my side.  I dove into ImageIO and have been pretty desperately trying to figure out the best way to determine if an image is compressed or not.  The sad news is that I am pretty sure it can't be done in a practical way without access to the original data - you can go down a weird path with CGDataProvider but that doesn't seem to always work either, but better than that is to inspect the actual NSData using CGImageSource.

I'm thinking of changing the Downloader and Cache protocols to return NSData in their completion blocks rather than CGImageRef.  This could be done as a breaking change for the 2.0 API for anyone who is not using ASBasicImageDownloader, which would certainly be one way to ensure that everyone is using the framework as intended.  We could inspect the NSDatas in DEBUG mode to ensure they are compressed, and if almost all are decompressed, we know something funny is going on (like a user getting the data out of an image after another library decompresses it).

Really though, I want to get the PINRemoteImage integration accomplished.  PIRI supports WebP, but also Progressive JPEG, GIF, etc...and ASDK absolutely needs a ""1st party""-quality image downloader and decoding suite.  @Adlai-Holler has done a lot of work on ASMultiplexImageNode recently and might have some further thoughts here.

One last thing - the implementation of ASImageNode's async draw method can be significantly improved for the case where a decoded image IS provided.  It was much more efficient for the version used by Paper.  The current version is using UIGraphics contexts regardless of the incoming image, since we can't check if it is decoded.  If it is decoded, we can use the image directly as the contents (potentially setting contentsCenter / contentsRect if necessary) to reduce by approximately half the memory consumed (depends on how much upscaling / downscaling is currently being done by allocating the new buffer of exactly the right size).

There's a great deal more that can be done with image handling; for example the Paper version would decode images at native size if they were smaller than the area to be shown in, rather than drawing them at the final size; if they were larger than the ideal size, it would redraw them into the ideal size to save memory.  Very simple and clearly just the beginning compared to using progressive JPEG to its fullest potential, supporting awesome fading transitions (the current placeholderFadesOut option is pretty shady), etc.

I will keep this issue open to add support for webP, and we should separately revisit whether there is a way to detect that a developer's custom downloader set up is erroneously providing decoded images to the framework.

2. If there is clipping of the handle in any case, we recently made the textView inset configurable which should address the problem by providing a way to give the handle room to breathe.

- You can now call setLiveMap before ASMapNode has been loaded to start off with a live map view.

922,2015-12-09 16:39:54,"@tomizimobile Thanks for another awesomely-thorough report!

On animations: I believe the reason `setAnimationsEnabled` isn't working in this case is, ASTableView enqueues those animations asynchronously after returning from `endUpdates`. In your test project, calling `tableView.endUpdatesAnimated(false, completion: nil)` does the trick for me. It's not API-compatible with UIKit, but is that OK?

On crashing when reloading data: This is indeed a bug in the framework! Diving in, I've found that during the `[super reloadData]`, `ASTableView` is returning 12 sections (the pre-filter value) when your table view data source is only returning 6 – the data controller must requery the underlying data source immediately, or else this `titleForHeader:` crash is inevitable. I tried shuffling around the implementation of `ASTableView.reloadData` but no luck.

The fact that `titleForHeader:` is a delegate method, not a data-source method, is kind of screwing with the data architecture of ASTableView, because it allows the client to talk directly to UITableView about its data, which isn't what's up. @nguyenhuy can you think of an approach that wouldn't tear ASTableView apart?

I've been recently reading the source code of ASDK, It's really awesome! 

My question is : have you considered using CALayer's API: 

`- (void)renderInContext:(CGContextRef)ctx;""`?

Here is some sudo code:



This way I can still use UIKit objects and get layer's snapshot on the background thread.

Is there any thread-safety reason or other problems with this method?

920,2015-12-07 16:00:44,"@aaronschubert0 I'm not talking about ASDisplayNode here. I'm thinking if I can get a snapshot from a normal UIKit object on the background thread, I don't have to use ASDK to achieve the asynchronous rendering. As @appleguy says, the CoreAnimation API is designed for main thread only. However, the `[self.headIcon.layer renderInContext:context];` can be executed safely on the background thread.

Thanks for the detailed information in your report, @smyrgl - it was essential for me to be able to figure out this issue quickly and clearly.  visibleNodes I believe was added quite recently, and it looks like not quite finished - it's critical that this be bulletproof in its implementation.
",appleguy,smyrgl
915,2015-12-06 06:28:49,"This fixes the recently-reported deadlock, at least to the extent of my testing so far (100% repro with @Adlai-Holler 's test app before, 0% after).

It also adds a new header, ASDisplayNode+FrameworkPrivate.h, to avoid over-usage of *Internal and *+Subclasses.  I cleaned up several such usages.  Having wanted to do this for quite some time, I'm pretty happy to have the file established and know there is more cathartic refactoring to come!

ASHierarchyState itself is obviously similar to ASInterfaceState, but currently has only two state types and does /not/ currently perform operations when the state changes.  Instead, the state is checked by several key codepaths.  I would like to consider expanding this in the future to integrate things like isInHierarchy, and possibly finer-grained definitions of that such as ""in window"" vs ""in subtree / any hierarchy"".  Would love ideas both on the current behavior and future possibilities for refactoring + unification around a feature such as this.

The main thing remaining to do here is implement some tests, especially including the combination of the Rasterization and RangeManaged options in the same tree, with runtime enabling + disabling of Rasterization at different levels of the hierarchy.  Should also test that RangeManaged is not set on an ASCellNode used in isolation, but is in both ASTableView and ASCollectionView.  If anyone wants to give this a shot, please do - we need improved test harnesses too, and it may be necessary to do that to get strong coverage of this particular set of behaviors.

I'd love to have a couple community reviewers on this diff before landing it, so please comment!  At the same time, I want to land it quickly and get some testing from at least one or two users who have seen the deadlock.  Lastly, I need to ship this with 1.9.3 by end-of-day tomorrow (Sunday) or I will fall behind during the week.
",appleguy,Adlai-Holler
915,2015-12-06 21:59:27,"@Adlai-Holler so I implemented this in such a way that ASCellNode will behave like a regular node if it is not actually ingested by the ASTableView/ASCollectionView machinery.  The idea is that ASCellNode is a convenient superclass for things that may be used both standalone and inside a table / collection.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend this widely, but if it can be supported easily, it seems like more intuitive behavior rather than mysteriously breaking things like image loading.

The upshot is that this test you added fails, as it does go into the InHierarchy state after being added to a view.  What do you think: if an interface state is set on the node manually, should that trigger us to avoid automatically manipulating the state?  Or should we ""blow it away"" with the automatic behavior?  I think blowing it away (and changing this assert to check for InHierarchy) may be the best option for now.

913,2015-12-04 21:15:48,"This resolves #897. I added two test cases, and also posted a toy project https://github.com/Adlai-Holler/ASDKPlainNodeTest.
##### Changes
- Add new interface state `ASInterfaceStateInHierarchy` that unites all others. This is the interface state for non cell-hosted nodes that are in the window hierarchy. I don't like the name – I considered `Unknown` but that seems like none more than all, and I considered `All` but that's not very informative.
##### Questions
- What's the safest way to push the `inCellNode`ness down the hierarchy? It's sort of unsafe to walk up the node hierarchy to check during `willEnterHierarchy` and `didExitHierarchy`
- I added `checkViewHierarchy:` param to `_supernodeWithClass` but honestly I wish I had just removed that behavior altogether. We don't call `_supernodeWithClass` anywhere in our code. But I wanted to ask because I haven't thought through the possible benefits of walking up the view hierarchy.

I had been going off some code I found that mimics `@synchronized` from Obj-C, which accepts `AnyObject` into a function like so: 



Once I replaced my string constant with an `NSLock`, things are working as expected. 

Sorry for causing all that extra work for you when it turned out to be an issue on my end. With that said, I still have the previously mentioned issue with the app crashing when trying to use `reloadData()` instead of `beginUpdates()`/`endUpdates()`.

Unfortunately I'm not sure the old code is super good either – this code may be called on a background thread but it accesses the `superlayer` property, and having a superlayer hardly implies that we should download an image. 

@appleguy Would it be insane to, as long as only our cell nodes will get interface state info, check to see if we have an `ASCellNode` ancestor? Something roughly like `if ((self.as_cellNode == nil && self.isNodeLoaded) || self.interfaceState & ASInterfaceStateFetchData)`? It's not gorgeous, but it should get us decent interim behavior – cell nodes will load intelligently and all other nodes will fire away the download immediately, so long as the node is loaded. And then when the node gets loaded, if we're not in a cell node, we fire away also.

I was studying the code for this and realized the most likely cause is a ""performOnMain"" call that happens just before deallocation.  Then the main call occurs with something like reloadData, in the next runloop, and triggers the layout assertion.

Then I realized that a diff I had open to review would almost certainly address this condition.

I notice in the stack some stuff about GPRaptorEngine, and then a trampoline call.  Are you absolutely certain that the asyncDataSource and asyncDelegate are in a consistent state?  Remember, ASCollectionView has special behavior that creates a separation between the UIKit layer and the ASDK layer to facilitate asynchronous computation, so if your subclass of ASCollectionView is doing fancy stuff at the UIKit layer (such as calling UICollectionView methods that aren't bridged / implemented by ASCollectionView), it could cause a variety of issues like this.

It may well be that the bug is in ASDK, but it would be important to know if the reason is that ASDK is missing an override for some UICollectionView method that we didn't think of which your class may be using.  cc @levi

You can check the .calculatedLayout property to get the currently calculated ASLayout, which will not be set until the layout pass is completely done.  However, I caution that what you describe with multiple threads being involved sounds risky / difficult to get right.  I would be happy to advise further if you are able to explain in more detail 1) what you are trying to accomplish, and 2) what the details of your multithreading technique are.

886,2015-11-29 00:09:36,"@bimawa Cool diagram, thanks!  You are one of the only people I know who has attempted to use ReactiveCocoa with ASDK - the only other one I currently know of is @RuiAAPeres.

I think this is very likely to be perilous.  RAC is an amazing, very interesting framework — but these two are not known to be compatible, and from everything I know about RAC, they are pretty fundamentally difficult to integrate.

isFinalLayoutable is not to be used in the way that you're using it.  So be aware that it may seriously break other functionality.  This affects the internals of the layout system in ways that you are not intending, so it isn't a stable solution for what you'd like to do.  I'm not sure how RAC observation works, but if it is at all related to KVO, note that the ASDK properties (intentionally) are not KVO / KVC-compliant.

That said, from the diagram above, a few comments:
- ASLayoutSpec is not mutable after you have returned it from -layoutSpecThatFits:.  So, after the new data arrives, you must not modify any existing layout.  I in fact don't see a need for you to check if the current layout is done.
- Instead, I would expect you need to call something like -invalidateLayout and -setNeedsLayout, possibly -layoutIfNeeded if you want it to occur immediately (although the latter method must be called on the main thread, I'm pretty sure the others are thread safe - look at the implementation to confirm, as it is uncommon to use them off the main thread, but apparently with RAC this may be a useful property).
- It may be better to use a technique such as allocating a new node hierarchy once the new data has returned, and once it has finished layout (you can call -measureWithSizeRange: on any background thread yourself - and it will execute in-line, so you will no when it is done), you can ""wholesale replace"" the entire previous node hierarchy. This would make it so that it doesn't matter if the previous node hierarchy is finished or completed with layout.  You could use something like reloadRow/ItemAtIndexPath: and return the new ASCellNode, or manually replace a subnode of an existing ASCellNode.

I'm sure there are techniques that can be used to make this work, and I am open to changes to ASDK that will improve the compatibility with RAC if they are proposed by the community and don't negatively affect the complexity or behavior of ASDK apps that do not use RAC.  I'll rename this task for further discussion about RAC.

No threads were doing anything interesting. Since `ASImageNode.image` was set correctly, the multiplex logic seems to be working right.

The `ASImageNode` hadn't displayed since getting the high res image set. I ran `po [imageNode setNeedsDisplay]` and sure enough, the image node re-rendered at full-res.  Maybe the range controller suppressed a display and then forgot to come back and redo it?

I'm currently trying to think of a workaround because these blurry images are in a build for investors. ~~I'm thinking I'll override `willEnterHierarchy` and, with some leeway, make sure that the node has been/will be displayed soon.~~

880,2015-11-24 06:07:27,"@robmontesinos Hey, thanks for bringing this up.  Could you share a bit more information about the condition you're aiming to detect?  Does the server give an HTTP 404 or some other error when you access the other URL?

In general, it would be best for the app to be able to detect and adjust to this condition without relying simply on the URL request.  There are many reasons a URL request can fail, and of course it takes a full round trip time to figure out what has happened.

I'd suggest, for example, if the user changes their profile picture then immediately trigger a query of the server for any ""current user"" objects or other loaded data to get updated URLs - before the URLs are actually needed to be displayed.  A key reason for this is that the code which knows how to find the right URL, if the current one fails, is at a higher level in the architecture of the app than just the lowly image node.  The image node should not understand the true ""source"" of the image or how it would go about requesting an updated data model directly from the server.

All that said, yes it is probably fairly straightforward to add a callback to an image node delegate (I think Multiplex already has a  delegate or datasource API; Network might also) which reports any loading errors to the owner of the node.  This I think would be a reasonable step even if you don't use it for the purpose described, which I'd recommend avoiding.  The main consideration is whether the ASImageDownloader protocol is actually the best place to support this kind of thing.  For example, ASBasicImageDownloader could provide the error callback directly.  If it were added to the protocol itself, then it would require all downloaders to support passing the errors to the node just so the node could pass them to an /optional/ delegate method...and we don't want that.

You may want to use this AsyncDisplayKit-integrated version of SDWebImage: https://github.com/ide/WebASDKImageManager

Pinterest is also currently working on some special custom integrations between PINRemoteImage and AsyncDisplayKit, but this won't be available for a few months and we haven't thought about an error API outside the framework.

879,2015-11-29 00:32:14,"@smiLLe - you raise a reasonable point.  I have debated with myself about exactly what you're talking about — should ASDK include things such as UICollectionViewLayouts?

One reason it is not an obvious fit is that ASDK currently supports standard UICollectionViewLayouts, without any modification for ASDK (there is no special AS-subclass).  This means that a variety of Cocoapods can be directly imported, and even without modification, they can be kept up to date by following the version changes of the cocoa pod.  That's a compelling advantage.

@levi is also absolutely right that efficiently doing this layout is more work than we have here, and there are libraries to do it.

Perhaps most importantly, I think only about 10% or even less of ASDK apps would use this particular layout.  Though a small impact, the compiled size of a complex, efficient layout may be several dozen KB and would increase the build time of the framework for everyone, so it's something to think about.

All that said...I am thinking we will create a custom AS-based layout class soon, because it will provide important efficiency advantages over UICollectionViewLayout.  In that world, it becomes more interesting to include a library of built-in layouts.  I appreciate very much having your vote on this as it really does influence what we decide to do here.

Note that aside from cocoapods you can search for, this PR was put up a while back that has some pretty hardcore code to do this, and looks like it might be very efficient.  It would probably need some adaptation to use, but may form the base of a future built-in layout.  Thanks @xujim for writing it!!  https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/435

If this fix is carefully tested to be safe for all use cases that don't rely on Interface Builder, and also doesn't have any negative impact on performance, I'm happy to take it even if it only benefits IB.  However, the text code paths are tremendously critical to the framework so we need to move very carefully here.

If you could tweak the brace style to match the nearby methods and remove the Podfile.lock method, we'll be closer to landing.

@levi or @rcancro if you happen to have time to look into the test project to understand the issue and the fix, that would be great.  It will take me at least a week to get back to this because of some key deliverables before Thanksgiving, and then visiting family for the rest of the week, but we will keep this PR open until a decision is made.

Good to have you engaging with the project @soniccat - let us know if we can help with your implementation!

877,2015-11-30 20:15:07,"@soniccat I'm still looking at this one actively - thanks for your patience, and providing detailed information.  Is it correct to understand this diff as automatically re-measuring the text /synchronously on the drawing thread/ in the event there is a size mismatch?

@ocrickard, @levi I would be interested in your thoughts on this behavior.  I really don't think this is necessarily the right behavior to fix the XIB case, but it may be a better behavior for the framework overall.  In the XIB case, we might as well skip the first measurement entirely if the text node's size is not essential to calculating the layout (e.g., if the layout defines the text node's constrained size, but the calculated size is not actually needed).

@nguyenhuy, @soniccat my concern with this is that the overall layout may be incorrect in this scenario, and this behavior could potentially hide the incorrectness in some cases (e.g. making it behave correctly when the actual inputs / code flows are not normal, such as requiring double-sizing of text).

The alternative might be to rely on -invalidateLayout or some other call, and ensure that if the display pass detects there is a mismatch, it triggers as complete of a layout pass is necessary to guarantee that any components that are affected by the newly calculated size of the text have a chance to be adjusted.  This could even mean abandoning the current display pass with an early return and calling -setNeedsDisplay, awaiting a new display call after the relayout is complete?

@rcancro and @nguyenhuy have discussed this with me and we are trying to figure out the right behavior.  Because the layout system is so configurable, there are pitfalls to most changes; for example I have a PR up to set flexShrink on by default for ASTextNode, because it seems more intuitive, but I haven't landed it yet as it does have a couple tradeoffs.

This isolated case may be easier to fix if we decide that the Inset should inherit flexGrow or flexShrink from its child.  However, another case we've considered is when you have a vertical stack and every item (say they are ASTextNodes) has flexShrink set.  If we did this for Inset and not for Stack, it could be confusing; but if we did it for both, there are other tradeoffs and it still wouldn't apply to custom specs.

Anyway, we'd be thrilled if you have any thoughts (read: value judgements - what seems like the ""right"" behavior for these subjective decisions?) to share with us.

861,2015-11-30 01:11:54,"@Adlai-Holler solid debugging here — a very clear explanation of the problem.  I think this is strong support for the impression that ASRangeController needs its first big refactor, as today its core logic is from the same era as the original ASDataController (!!!).

@1nput0utput could you share any details on the issue you encountered?  Was your case specific to reloadData (and thus fixed by the patch linked above), or is the editing scenario described later the one you are seeing?

As per usual with these issues, not having a test case is one inhibition to fixing with confidence.  I'm actively mucking about in ASRangeController (and @levi too, who did a sweeping cleanup of naming and organization of the file in prep for deeper changes).  But with the weekend dwindling, I may not be able to fix this in time for 1.9.2...

The PR I just landed, with ASInterfaceState, holds the potential to help us fix this.  It makes nodes tolerant to ""sloppy"" behavior of a class like ASRangeController, in that if the class were too chatty and told it to enter or exit a state multiple times, it would short-circuit and not actually cause errant calls to fetchData / clearContents / etc (this was not the case before the patch).  So if we found the right point at which to do a reconciliation (setting the intended state on all the nodes involved), it could actually be pretty efficient.

The ideal refactor for ASRangeController will be to eliminate ASRangeHandler entirely, and call setInterfaceState only once per node on a given pass.  This would particularly optimize the case being described here where new / replacement nodes may need to have multiple elements of the state set (such as visible, display, fetchData).

- The mapView property is now a MKMapView rather than a ASDisplayNode
- The mapSize property has been removed. If developers wish to set an explicit size for ASMapNode, then they can set the preferredFrameSize property.
- ""automaticallyReloadsMapImageOnOrientationChange"" has been renamed to ""needsMapReloadOnBoundsChange""
- ""-addAnnotations:"" has been renamed ""setAnnotations:""
- All scalar size properties (_maxSize & _nodeSize) have been removed (yay!) in favour of `self.bounds.size` or `self.calculatedSize`
- ""-calculateSizeThatFits:"" has been removed as suggested by @nguyenhuy 
- ASMapNode now automatically fetches a new map snapshot if it's size is changed, as opposed to only on orientation change.

825,2015-11-07 15:10:17,"I had some free time on a plane yesterday and saw this piece of low hanging fruit that didn't require much focus. I would like to contribute an ASLabelNode in the next couple of weeks and updating the backing renderer is a much needed addition before implementing methods like `minimumFontSize` and `adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth`.

Some unit tests are failing right now, as it seems that the floating point math doesn't produce consistent results. @appleguy, you might have deeper insight into why this is. Going to dig a bit deeper into the TextKit sizing behavior to see what changed from the original implementation of ASTextNodeRenderer.

There were some API differences. I ended up adding an exclusionPaths attribute to the CKTextKitRenderer, which probably would make sense to contribute back to ComponentKit. `isTruncated` is reimplemented, as the truncation range is no longer exposed. And I ran into a build error when trying to include `ASTextKitRenderer.h` in the umbrella AsyncDisplayKit.h, as it seems to be trying to build the header as a C header and is confused where to find the `#import <vector>` c++ std lib header. I haven't worked much with Xcode's C++ integration, so help would be appreciated.

I removed the legacy tests that were specific to the original renderer API. Naturally, I would like to bring up the tests to speed and need to decide a good testing strategy for this implementation. CK has a great suite of unit tests and there might be some value in copying them over to increase the coverage stats in the project. On the integration side, a snapshot test or two could be valuable, but need to identify possible areas of regression before spending too much time on creating test cases.

Ahh, yeah now I remember. There's a hack in ASTextNode that allows that test to work. It was added by @mboyd1017. Not sure exactly how to fix that in the cached renderer world... perhaps store a value with the calculated size as its key in the renderer cache?

Both CoreText and TextKit will return different values when laid out with one constraint, then recompute the layout with the calculated bounds. Due to a combination of float math, complex line breaking algorithms, and magic... it's inconsistent. The best we can do is workaround it.

BTW, I didn't notice before, but this doesn't pull in the renderer cache. You're gonna miss out on some of the perf and memory benefits without that... but this should be a cleaner implementation to support in the future.

The use case is as ""simple"" as having a horizontal collection that goes into a vertical scroll view, and wanting to know the height of the overall collection in consideration of its items.  Another is when showing a modal sheet, if it is wrapping a small ASTableNode that may only have 3 or 4 items, calculating the necessary height of the modal can be tough.

@Adlai-Holler had looked into this a bit to see if we could at least provide a well-defined hook that, by its call time, contentSize is set.  It seems like even this is difficult, even after controlling for the async measurement operations, but I'm not exactly sure why.

The first issue seems pretty simple to fix - we don't always exit all our ranges in tear down. 

The second issue is deeper and is more of a structural problem. This has to do when we perform updates (inserts/deletes, etc). The ASRangeController is maintaining an array of index paths for each range (Render and Preload) and as the range of visible index paths change we update these arrays and call enter or exit for each underlying node. This all works fins until we insert or delete items. At that point our index paths become invalid. Currently we set a flag (_rangeIsValid = NO) and discard all the old index paths. The problem is that we don't exit these index paths, so it's possible we will either enter them twice or never exit them at all. Failing to exit nodes in the Rendered range will cause the cell nodes to be retained in memory forever (they will accumulate in the ASRangeHandlerRender's workingWindow.)

I could totally be wrong about this (maybe all the issues I'm seeing are entirely from the first issue), I'd love to get some additional eyes on this. I'm looking specifically at  [ASRangeController.mm:117](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/a1dee22a0959b81835706caef510ae62df26c30e/AsyncDisplayKit/Details/ASRangeController.mm#L117).

I've been considering a couple fixes for this:
1. exiting all ranges/nodes when we first have changes is probably safest but would likely cause other issues and have a significant performance cost.
2. Somehow tracking the nodes either instead of or in addition to the indexPaths for each range. This could allow us to handle this edge case, but we would have to be careful not to retain the cellNodes too long.
3. A hybrid approach. While everything is valid we work off of index paths the way we do today but we track nodes during changes. So it would look something like the following
   - When we first start making changes (begin updates), capture the nodes associated with all current ranges.
   - When we are done making changes, grab the current visible index paths and get the nodes for each. Compare the previous nodes with the new ones and make sure we exit/enter the deltas.

   - When we first start making changes (begin updates), capture the nodes associated with all current ranges.
   - When we are done making changes, grab the current visible index paths and get the nodes for each. Compare the previous nodes with the new ones and make sure we exit/enter the deltas.

797,2015-10-30 21:08:30,"I've been tracking leaking ASCellNodes in my application and, thanks to reading up on #791, I think I'm on the right track. 

The first issue seems pretty simple to fix - we don't always exit all our ranges in tear down. 

The second issue is deeper and is more of a structural problem. This has to do when we perform updates (inserts/deletes, etc). The ASRangeController is maintaining an array of index paths for each range (Render and Preload) and as the range of visible index paths change we update these arrays and call enter or exit for each underlying node. This all works fins until we insert or delete items. At that point our index paths become invalid. Currently we set a flag (_rangeIsValid = NO) and discard all the old index paths. The problem is that we don't exit these index paths, so it's possible we will either enter them twice or never exit them at all. Failing to exit nodes in the Rendered range will cause the cell nodes to be retained in memory forever (they will accumulate in the ASRangeHandlerRender's workingWindow.)

I could totally be wrong about this (maybe all the issues I'm seeing are entirely from the first issue), I'd love to get some additional eyes on this. I'm looking specifically at  [ASRangeController.mm:117](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/a1dee22a0959b81835706caef510ae62df26c30e/AsyncDisplayKit/Details/ASRangeController.mm#L117). Funny thing about that part of the code base (_rangeIsValid handling), I think I was the last one to touch it. @appleguy, @levi and @nguyenhuy, what do you think, am I right about this being a problem?

I've been considering a couple fixes for this:
1. exiting all ranges/nodes when we first have changes is probably safest but would likely cause other issues and have a significant performance cost.
2. Somehow tracking the nodes either instead of or in addition to the indexPaths for each range. This could allow us to handle this edge case, but we would have to be careful not to retain the cellNodes too long.
3. A hybrid approach. While everything is valid we work off of index paths the way we do today but we track nodes during changes. So it would look something like the following

Clearly ASLayoutSpec is capable of performing all the calculations needed; we just need to determine what a reasonable specialized behavior is for ASScrollNode and how to integrate it seamlessly in a way that is intuitive.

One way might be: children of ASScrollNodes are given unbounded size in the direction of scrolling, if we can determine the scroll direction at layout time.  Then we need a way to actually set the contentSize, which might be based on using CGRect unions of all of the layout specs / nodes within the scroll node and using the maximum width of that joint rect?

We create our own NSURLSession, instead of using +sharedSession.  Is this necessary?  It would seem to be more efficient to use the same object, especially because the session probably does some degree of concurrency limiting to more efficiently manage the network bandwidth.

More importantly, it would then also make sense to avoid using the delegate property entirely, and have a completion block.  The block would of course retain self during the task pending, but if it gets cancelled (which occurs when the ASNetworkImageNode is deallocating) or finishes naturally, then the block would run and be destroyed — freeing the ASBasicImageDownloader and breaking the cycle.

If you have any time to look at the code and consider making those changes, I'd be greatly appreciative.  It would allow me to focus on a few other changes I'd like to do.  Just let me know if you're not available though, and I will start reading more deeply about NSURLSession (since it came out with iOS 7 & I used custom networkers in most of my projects, it's quite new to me).

If anyone else has time to investigate a more targeted fix here, which requires some refactoring of ASBasicImageDownloader, it would be appreciated.  @TernTuring I'm pretty confident you could figure out a solution, too; basically we need to use something like a completionBlock instead of a persistent delegate so that the retain cycle is only temporary, and does end when the request finishes or is cancelled.

759,2015-10-21 17:31:51,"@robmontesinos Do you somehow provide a fixed constrained height for each cell node? I asked this question because currently ASTableViewDataSource can't provide different constrained heights for each cells. And without a fixed constrained height (63, right?), the text nodes can grow vertically to wrap their texts. I think it makes sense to have -constrainedHeightForNodeAtIndexPath: in ASTableViewDataSource (note: not constrained size but constrained height, because we want table view cells to always fill the table view width). @appleguy, @rcancro: What do you think?

In case you are curious about why setting ""all three"" works, here is my explanation:
- Since the vertical stack is a child of a horizontal stack, enabling flexShrink on the vertical stack means it can shrink horizontally (flexShrink is effective on the stack direction). So the vertical stack fills the available width.
- The 2 text nodes are children of a vertical stack, so flexShrink means they can shrink vertically and thus fill the available height, which is 63 in this case.

Also, can the caption text (and title text) be really long? If so then it is possible that one of the 2 text nodes (likely titleTextNode because caption text is usually much longer) will be asked to shrink to a very small size that it cannot render even 1 line of text (or even asked to shrink to 0). This is because stack layout spec distributes stack-dimension violations evenly to all of its flexible children. Fortunately, you can easily handle this case. 
- Instead of enabling flexShrink on titleTextNode, you can set its maximumLineCount to 1 (or maybe 2). This change causes titleTextNode to always have enough space to render at most 1 line, and captionTextNode can fill the remaining height.
- Or if the caption is optional, you can just disable flexShrink on titleTextNode. This way, titleTextNode will take as much (vertical) space as it wants.

759,2015-10-21 17:41:33,"@appleguy: I think it's a good idea to have flexShrink enabled by default for text nodes. @rcancro: How about you?

> One framework improvement that would be nice — but may not be logically compatible with the overall layout rules of Flexbox... — would be if a stack containing all flexShrink = YES items were automatically flexShrink itself.

Since flexShrink is used against the stack dimension of the parent stack, I think this can confuse other developers. For example, if all children in a vertical stack can shrink (vertically), that doesn't always mean the vertical stack itself should shrink horizontally (if added inside a horizontally stack). It is true in @robmontesinos's layout because he happens to want a fixed height, but not in other (normal) cases.

757,2015-10-20 20:19:45,"@wy19901227 do you mean, why are they not the same width?

The reason is that the text is actually not exactly the same width.  The width of a given character, in this case the digit, does vary a little in most fonts.  Only in true Monospace fonts is that not true.

The right way to solve this depends on how you want the design to look.  For example, if you really did want the grey region to not reach to the left and right sides of the screen, you would need to have a mechanism to determine the text that is maximum width and then make sure that all the other ones also adopt that width.

@rcancro I bet there is a way to do this with layout specs, automatically, but I'm not totally sure what it would be...if you imagined that the 0-9 cells were actually all subnodes of a single ASCellNode, and the ASCellNode returned an ASStackLayoutSpec from -layoutSpecThatFits, would it work to set the .flexBasis = ASRelativeDimensionMakeWithPercent(1.0) on each of the text nodes contained by the stack?

755,2015-10-20 20:30:05,"@nguyenhuy since you just significantly revised how batch processing works, take a look at this stack and let us know if you think it would be addressed by your diff.

@nvh, please look at the active PR that is up for that.  If you were already running against master, if you could do a quick test for us against @nguyenhuy's patch it would be really awesome.

Batch updates in particular have been a weak spot for a long time; my ASDataController refactor from a couple months ago stabilized the basic editing flows, but it's taken until now to get the critical investment needed to finally eliminate all remaining issues with slightly more complex editing flows.  This is arguably the #1 priority of the project right now, so being able to confirm whether Huy's patch is sufficient or incomplete will be excellent input.

755,2015-10-27 05:54:55,"@nguyenhuy thanks a bunch for digging into this.  We absolutely have to fix this.  @nvh we appreciate you trying yet another patch and apologize for the fact that this has not worked in your app.

@levi, was it your app that had an NSFetchedResultsController?  We really need to make a checked-in examples/ test case that uses an FRC and can reproduce a case as stressful as @nvh's app causes, as I think we have at least 5 different apps with pretty serious edit behavior that haven't yet broken master.

I experimented a little more tonight but didn't make much progress.  I'm sure it'll be easy for you to see where the mistakes are.  Here's a demo project of what I have so far on the cells.  The only problems at the moment are that the +1 isn't inside the gray circle for the profilePictureGroupNode, the likes aren't aligned to the right, and when the message has an image, the text should be added to the bottom of that image.  

Oh, also, I can't get the profileGroupNode to layout without wrapping it in a staticLayoutSpec which doesn't seem like it should be necessary.  I assume I'm doing something with its layout wrong too but maybe thats just the way it works?

Does your code have any reference to contentsScaleForDisplay, if you do a full text search of the project?  I have never seen this issue reported, so it initially seems like it would be an issue where you set this property to 0.  Unlike some other areas where you can set 0 and expect it to automatically use the screen scale, that's not the case for this property.

718,2015-10-06 22:25:44,"@vitalybaev ah, so are you asking about animating the size of the cells?  I am very happy you provided images as it REALLY helps understand your use case.  However, I don't completely understand these because neither of them have an image placeholder state, and the first one also doesn't show the ""some text at the bottom"".  So I'm not sure what the desired behavior is, that you would like it to have, to get from the placeholder state to the final state.  Happy to help figure it out once I better understand the intended behavior!

Look at the examples/Kittens app for some examples of cell resizing and relayout.  When you tap on a cell, it does a relayout, which involves calling -invalidateCalculatedLayout and calling -reloadRowAtIndexPath:.

@nguyenhuy sorry to ask again, but could you remind me if there were any other method calls required here?  The ASTableView /SHOULD/ be able to detect that the cell has an invalidated layout, and requires a synchronous measure pass as part of the row reload, but does it do that right now?  Lastly, can you think of an API improvement we can make for this to be a one-line call?  Two ideas for that:
          - Method on ASCellNode, like ""reload"" (but different name), that triggers a full relayout /and/ messages the owning ASTableView or ASCollectionView to reload its index path.
          - Method on each ASTableView and ASCollectionView to ""relayoutAndAnimateHeightForIndexPath:"" or something.

716,2015-10-06 15:45:54,"I started replacing my previous solution (a `UIPageViewController`) with a `ASCollectionView`,since it would allow me create cells ahead of time (working range). The thing I am seeing and is validated by this #540, is that the cells won't be deallocated, so the `UIViewController` it has as a subview, will be kept alive. After scrolling  for about 50 cells, the app eventually gets killed due to memory constrains. What would be the best approach in this case? 

After seeing @ryanfitz's approach by keeping a reference to the header node and then calling `recursivelyClearContents` is something I am contemplating, but I wonder if I am missing something here.

The cell itself is quite simple and the mechanism maybe slightly archaic:



I understand the need to get all the different cells in order to calculate the size of each cell. But my expectations were: if a cell is out of the working range, it should be purged.

That's true even if the containing node uses -layoutSpecThatFits:.

-measureWithSizeRange will be automatically called on the ASCellNode by the containing table / collection.  The actual call is in ASDataController.mm if you are interested to understand it.  There may now be an API to provide a full size /range/ for constraining the cell nodes — I think this was added recently.  If not, it would be trivial to add.

That said, by using preferredFrameSize, you should normally not need to use the minimum size on the size range.  If you encounter any problems with the layout system where it's not clear how to achieve the right layout, please post here.

712,2015-10-07 02:52:16,"@richardoti very cool!

Have you taken a look at .imageModificationBlock yet?  This should be able to do what you're demonstrating, and on older devices, will help scrolling performance...at the cost of /slightly/ longer time to prepare the image.  It's a pretty good tradeoff overall.

Note, if you are enabling shouldRasterizeSubnodes on the parent (e.g. cell) anyway, then this essentially won't matter because the whole hierarchy will be collapsed.

Important note about shouldRasterizeSubnodes: ideally, you should structure your hierarchy in a way that allows you to AVOID including network-loaded images (particularly big ones) and large blank areas in the rasterization.  If a big network loaded image is included, then when it loads, it will cause everything else in the rasterization area to have to be redrawn.  Plus, blank space is part of the same rasterization area, and memory is spent on it.  In the scheme of things, these are actually smaller optimizations, and you will still notice big performance improvements from rasterization in many cases even without doing it.  But the rule of thumb is that views are not ALWAYS bad, and you may want to have a rasterized node for your feedback interface at the bottom of the cell, a rasterized node for the header information at the top, and leave the photo itself (and padding around it) outside of a rasterized zone.

The +4 example you give here, even if you have it network-loaded, would be pretty reasonable to rasterize as re-drawing the +4 is not particularly expensive, and the rasterization will collapse the overlay effect for you.  But I think it's probably better overall to use imageModificationBlock and leave rasterization off, unless you had the asset locally stored rather than network-loaded..
",appleguy,richardoti
712,2015-10-08 01:32:15,"@richardoti rasterizing each of the individual components, without doing it for the cell itself, is a good approach.

You may consider extending your working range (rangeTuningParameters, for either network or rendering) if you are seeing blank placeholders onscreen too frequently.  If you scroll extremely quickly though, you have to choose: either you drop frames, or you allow some unrendered content onscreen.  I'd encourage you to experiment with the rather amazing new property, .neverShowPlaceholders, on ASCellNode.  If you set it to YES, it should prevent placeholders from ever being onscreen.  The effect is that slow and normal speed scrolling remains perfectly smooth (as long as the working range is big enough), but high speed scrolling starts dropping frames in order to ensure there is never a totally blank element onscreen.

- In ASDataController our enqueued edit command blocks are now `(_ASHierarchyChangeSet -> Void)`. During `endUpdates` we create a change set, run all the blocks to load it up with data, then call `markCompleted` so the changeset does its logic, then we do `accessDataSourceWithBlock` and go through the sorted, coalesced changes, applying them using the same code that we USED to use in the edit command block.

Let me start by saying that I'm not afraid of a change that hugely changes ASDataController — obviously it would need to be rigorously tested, but let's face it, the class needs some upgrades.  The critical piece: we must get the architecture RIGHT.  It isn't worth the testing pain of a really big change if we can spot any difficult limitations of its structure that wouldn't be resolvable with later improvements moving in the same direction.

That said, it does seem likely that we could solve this problem with a more surgical change.  I'd buy it that this direction may be BETTER despite the higher initial risk, if we believe it results in code that is easier to debug, read, maintain, extend, or more performant — or any combination of a few of those.

693,2015-10-01 02:08:30,"This is really awesome, thanks so much @Adlai-Holler for your large-scale contributions!  I will review in detail this weekend.

Let me start by saying that I'm not afraid of a change that hugely changes ASDataController — obviously it would need to be rigorously tested, but let's face it, the class needs some upgrades.  The critical piece: we must get the architecture RIGHT.  It isn't worth the testing pain of a really big change if we can spot any difficult limitations of its structure that wouldn't be resolvable with later improvements moving in the same direction.

That said, it does seem likely that we could solve this problem with a more surgical change.  I'd buy it that this direction may be BETTER despite the higher initial risk, if we believe it results in code that is easier to debug, read, maintain, extend, or more performant — or any combination of a few of those.

691,2015-09-28 16:39:16,"Issue #690 brought up a good point I've been thinking about as I was putting together the supplementary view architecture briefly this weekend. The current data controller integration with ASCollectionView reiles upon layout invalidation from reloading/inserting/deleting/moving items or @nguyenhuy's new relayout items based upon the collection view's bounds changes. These behaviors closely model the specific implementation of a table view, but it's clear as we have begun to mature the behavior of our collection view most of the sizing events and values (namely constrainedSizeForNode:) have been built around the powerful Collection view layouts.

I've been doing a bit of research into the `invalidateLayout` and `invaldateLayoutWithContext:` methods. While the provided context is not as granular as I initially hoped, I believe these events are great candidates for us to use as hooks for relayout events in the collection view's data controller.

Moreover, as we query the collection view for constrained sizes I think we should start asking the collection view layout for specific values. This will move the layout (constrainedSizeForNode:) code we currently have in ASCollectionView into a separate place that is specific to the current collection view layout.

With that, a couple of solutions have come to mind:
1. Make ASDataController an abstract class that table view and collection view have concrete implementations of. This will give each view the ability to add custom behavior such as supplementary views for collection views and header/footer nodes for tables views.
2. Once that we have a concrete ASCollectionDataController with supplementary view support, the data controller interfaces with a strategy object that provides all the necessary answers to questions from the data controller about the current layout. For example, ""how many supplementary views are in this section?"", ""what's the constrained size for this node?"". This strategy is provided by the client of ASCollectionView and either set directly as a property on ASCollectionDataController or is composed in ASViewController and its values returned at specific points of the data controllers data source method (I'm leaning toward the latter). The default limitation would be a generic strategy for flow layouts.
3. We migrate ASCollectionView to start node invalidation and relayout on ‘invalidateLayout‘ events. I already have the proxying of invalidateLayout working in a branch, but it's beyond the scope of implementing supplementary views into ASCollectionView. This will allow us to support ‘itemSize‘ changes in a flow layout, for example, and respect the layout invalidation events that can at times use animation transitions to change the item's sizes. 
#1 and #2 is where I'm planning to go this week to get my branch building and running. I feel that it should be a flexible enough solution to test and also to continue composing as custom layout authors investigate using their layouts with supplementary views. #3 is where I'd like to start discussion, as it's a little more involved and not something I'm planning to do this week.

Wrote this on my phone, so let me know if anything doesn't make sense.

I'm also engaged to learn you are using ASDK with Core Data, as I have some experience doing that at Facebook (Paper originally used Core Data, but a major port removed it in the second year of development; Facebook used CD in production for a long time, but has also ported to a custom stack).  It is definitely one of the most likely cases I can see that would hit this bug.

It is a reasonable thing to block the main thread on a background queue, naturally just as long as the background queue structurally has no reason to ever want to block on main.  Incidentally, the implementation of the ""synchronous concurrency"" features I talked about at NSSpain will require blocking the main thread on completion of in-flight rendering in certain cases.

671,2015-09-25 03:13:08,"I spent more time investigating this.  I'm actually pretty worried at this point, because I don't have a lead or a good idea for the debugging approach.

The tests are definitely running within a UIKit app.  The stack traces that show the calling of the @dynamic methods (which crash for doesNotRespondToSelector) clearly show UIApplicationMain at the bottom of the stack.  I don't think there should be any difference between the way CALayer handles the @dynamic methods in a regular running session vs the test app, but there quite clearly is.

There is at least one place where we may depend on the fact that CA makes the properties KVC-compliant when it generates them itself.  I'm not sure if this would be supported if we manually implemented these methods, and would really like to avoid doing that until someone is able to help us understand the root cause for the behavior change.  The biggest mystery here is not only why the same code behaves differently under Xcode 6.4 vs 7.0, but also why it only affects the test application. 

I studied the project file / build configurations, but didn't see anything suspicious in the setup for the test environment.

649,2015-09-22 19:31:55,"What classes are you using to contain the images?  The behavior you've described would definitely be the case if you are using UIImageView anywhere, but it should not be the case with ASImageNode (or ASNetworkImageNode, ASMultiplexImageNode).  These are tuned such that even on an iPhone 4, with a slow single-core processor, ASDK can achieve 60FPS while scrolling through large images.

I'd love to help you analyze a Time Profiler trace (from Instruments) if you can capture the phenomenon.  Since uploading files can be tough, maybe you can start by taking a quick trace (just 10-30 seconds of experiencing the issue), and then paste here a screenshot of the top costs being charged to the main thread during that period (e.g., after application startup, just the scroll session highlighted).

649,2015-10-01 03:33:59,"@richardoti forgive me if I asked this, but what version of ASDK are you running?  There are several fixes to layout with shouldRasterizeDecedents that went in around the time of the last 1.2.x releases, and I'm not sure if all of them were in 1.2.3.  We were considering a 1.2.4 but it did not happen, so they may only be complete in the master / 2.0 Beta branch.

I have not had time to release an actual 2.0 Beta branch, but master is very stable at the moment (the notable exception being certain types of more complex batch edit operations with ASTableView, which are still better-handled in master than 1.2.3).  As we continue the discussion to get to the bottom of the issue, can you make sure your podfile is pointing to master and retry your test of rasterization?
",appleguy,richardoti
649,2015-10-01 03:51:49,"@richardoti thanks for the link to the project — that is really awesome!  I would love to get it running.  I got InfiniteScroll set up, with pods installed, but it crashes when I launch the app saying there is no JSON file for the english locale.  Do you have a local fork that I could run?

The behavior you describe is interesting and certainly useful to help debug the problem (fast scrolling is smooth, but slower scrolling is choppy).  This suggests to me that it /could/ be the image downloader or another system that is contributing to the frame drops.  It may also be ASDK, although I have not yet seen that behavior with ASDK in quite a few different apps.

I'll try to respond more quickly, but it's up to you if you'd like to continue debugging one step at a time or if you prefer I get set up with a working version of the app to proactively debug the issue.  I really would like to fully understand and fix it with you, so either way is fine to me.  Even if we fixed the layout of rasterization, and that fixed your issue, I'd love to see profiles of the slow case.

The image cache will mainly impact users revisiting images after they were initially downloaded, and memory usage.  In general an app should have a way to move images from memory into disk cache, and also manage the purging of the disk cache appropriately — otherwise there is a tendency to want to cache more in memory, which 1) puts the app closer to being evicted by the system, which is not always signaled before it happens; 2) shuts down other processes the user has open, slowing them down.  The symptom however would be greater LOAD TIMES for images, and to my knowledge should not have any impact on frame rates.

649,2015-10-02 00:47:07,"I was able to reproduce the issue thanks to your help, @richardoti .  It does appear that using the latest ASDK changes the symptoms of the layout problem with rasterization, but there is still a problem, particularly the size of the image.  I am having trouble debugging it because I have not yet used the debugger with Swift, and it is preventing me from printing out simple variables from a breakpoint in CellNode.swift:

It's very odd to me, and I'm not sure how anyone could use Swift if it didn't allow debugging, so I must be doing something wrong...

The actual input image size should not matter, but preferredFrameSize is a good property to set if you know the size it should display, but don't have a subclass where you can easily override -calculateLayoutThatFits:.
",appleguy,richardoti
649,2015-10-05 00:30:10,"@richardoti ok, I'm in the midst of debugging.  The debugger is occasionally working, in different method scopes, and I'll add NSLogs for other areas...a bit frustrating, still not sure what's up with that.

Important questions for you, though:
- What is the intent / need for the ""height"" and ""width"" properties on PostComponentNode?  I am not yet sure how these are used, but I'm pretty confident they are not hooked up properly to integrate with ASDK's layout system.
- You should be able to use -calculatedLayout (and just call the size property), or -calculatedSize, on any ASDisplayNode.  This is set after -measure: is called on them, which is what triggers the pass of ONE of the following methods, depending on which you've chosen to use: -calculateSizeThatFits: / -calculateLayoutThatFits: / -layoutSpecThatFits.
- If you're interested in using the newer layout components (e.g. ASLayoutSpec), they would work perfectly for this app and make the layout code MUCH cleaner.  Implementing only -layoutSpecThatFits: would eliminate both -calculateSizeThatFits: AND -layout, and be more readable.
- If you'd prefer the additional manual control, I'd recommend at least porting to -calculateLayoutThatFits:.  This allows you to eliminate the -layout method entirely.

I don't yet know if the behavior difference with rasterization on is due to a bug in ASDK, or is a side-effect of your implementation not fitting with the assumptions that ASDK makes (e.g. intended structure / usage of the API).  I would like it to behave the same even if API usage is not quite correct, so I'll investigate further, but I think one of the best things you could do is refactor the layout code a bit to use some of the new 2.0 concepts.
",appleguy,richardoti
649,2015-10-05 02:49:57,"@richardoti what made me a bit concerned is it seemed some things had width / height /in the initializer method/, rather than just properties that the node computes.  That's not a normal pattern and may be contributing to the issues here.

I'd recommend refactoring that stuff, and completely eliminate the height / width properties.  Any issues you run into from deleting them should lead you to the areas that would benefit from refactoring.

BTW, for the inset, a great pattern would be to create an ASInsetLayoutSpec in the cell node's -layoutSpecThatFits: method.

The change that resolves it is https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/710.

I tested your code locally and it works fine with this.  As I alluded to before, I was pretty torn by the fact that there were any visual differences with the rasterize mode on, as it should not be the case even if the layout code is not ideally factored.  I can imagine certain substantial misuses of the API that might cause that, but although I didn't completely understand the layout implementation in your test code, it did implement both -calculateSizeThatFits and -layout — so it should work.

That said, I'd love to help you adopt the 2.0 layout constructs if that is something you're interested in.

Depending on your layout, indeed it may be important to set a non-zero minimum size.  Call -measureWithSizeRange: instead of -measure:.  This is also a new API in 2.0.  We will likely discontinue the -measure API (mark it deprecated) because it is somewhat confusing to have this behavior, where the min size is set to zero by default if you use -measure.

Could you open a new task for us to continue the interesting discussion on the new layout patterns, and then close this one?  The feedback from following your experience trying out the new API is very useful.  Of course, given that there is no documentation, I apologize it will be a rough road to learn some of this stuff — that's entirely not your fault!

644,2015-09-08 18:32:25,"Three notes:
- We should carefully consider alternative methods to terminate the recursion (provide a base case for) calling -finalLayoutable.  Ideally we could remove the Parent argument, and ASDisplayNode / ASLayoutSpec base classes would return ""self"".  This may not be possible, but failing to do so means that the abstraction is in some way impure; the base class implementations would quite literally be false if they return nil.  This may inhibit curious parties from fully understanding the system as they explore the code (it's the most likely method to get looked at, as subclassers override it and want to look at the superclass implementation)
- We should think about alternatives to the NSCopying / merging of ASLayoutOptions.  I am fairly confident that it would be better for the ASLayoutSpec subclass to bear the responsibility of exploring the layout tree to whatever depth it requires to operate properly.  In the case of ASStackLayoutSpec, it should probably traverse to the leaf nodes in its search for baseline-alignment hints, and then we can document this behavior next to the definition of those properties.
- Lastly, some way to bring visibility to the @dynamic properties will likely be important.  Right now they're hidden in a separate file, and may not be observed by users of ASDisplayNode or ASStackLayoutSpec.

638,2015-09-06 00:41:40,"Hey Connor, I left the same note as a pull request on your repo, but I'll post it here too for reference:

> When a collection view is instantiated and its `layoutSubviews` method is called, it will automatically call `reloadData` to initialize the data within the collection. Problem is ASDK loads collection view cells off the main thread, delegating the bulk of the work to the `ASDataController` to notify the collection view to reload specific sections and items when the nodes in `_editingNodes` transition into the `_completedNodes` collection. Thus you won't have any data until the data controller is completely done with its initial rendering of the cells in your data source. The most straight forward way to work around this is the `reloadDataWithCompletion:` method which will give you a callback to do any work once the reloadData is done in the data controller.

It's not a completely obvious solution at first glance and @eanagel has brought up a good note in #587 about possible ways to make handling callbacks fired from the data controller clearer. Feel free to leave some feedback on that thread if you have ideas on how to improve the experience of dealing with async rendering.

",eanagel,appleguy
619,2015-08-26 20:55:16,"Ok I think I understand the problem here. Each change we ultimately push to UIViewController happens in a separate run loop (beginUpdates, insert, delete, endUpdates in separate blocks, for instance), so it is possible to do things on the main thread while we are in the middle of a begin/end updates block. When this is true, UITableView sees the original state, but we are updating _completedNodes as we go so it sees the updated state. Therefore, index paths that appear valid according to UITableView may be invalid (or wrong) when using nodeForRowAtIndexPath: This means it's not safe to get the node for an indexPath while this is happening, which I have several use cases for.

I think the ultimate solution would be to make sure all changes are committed to UITableView in a single runloop (beginUpdates/insert/delete/endUpdates in a single block) This would require some possibly significant refactoring of ASDataController to accomplish. My work around was is to keep a flag indicating I'm in begin/end updates and defer anything that might ultimately rely on _completedNodes. (Which is not a pretty picture, btw.)

613,2015-08-17 18:39:09,"This PR aims to improve the performance of `ASDisplayNode -init` by offloading invariant tasks to `+initialize`. This is done in a thread-safe manner by adding a method to each subclass of `ASDisplayNode` (and `ASDisplayNode` itself) which sets `_flags` and `_methodOverrides` with pre-calculated values. (Previously we were doing this work on each init.) Because `+initialize` is guaranteed to run before any other methods in the class, I believe it is thread-safe and reasonably goof-proof.

Of course due to the dynamic nature of Objective C, this can be broken. In fact, my initial implementation was broken immediately by our own tests which use a dynamic implementation of respondsToSelector for it's tests. I've added code that handles this case (degrading to the old functionality if it detects that `+respondsToSelector` or `-respondsToSelector` has been overridden.), but there are still a couple ways a really creative developer could break things: by adding methods we are testing using `class_addMethod` and friends, or by changing the return value of the respondsToSelector results after an instance has been created (which would break the current implementation as well.) These seem like pretty unlikely scenarios to me.

Since this does impact each and every instance of a node, it probably deserves some close inspection before we merge it in. I've tried to structure things so future developers can add to it without getting into the weeds too much.

Note: @appleguy I' did a trial merge into 1.2.3 to test in my application and found it pretty challenging because the code bases are shifting apart a bit here.

I think the right abstraction is some form of verticalOffset / baselineOffset property.  verticalOffset is the most general, which is great especially for something that applies to ALL nodes and specs...not just text nodes, and not just stack specs.

verticalOffset does tempt a different direction, though, something like a UIEdgeInsets.  That would capture the ascender / descender model, and it could be layoutOffset or something.

Interested in your thoughts Ricky — is there a compelling case for ascender and descender separately?  I know you're a Swift fan; it would be nice to have protocol extensions to support ASLayoutable evolving into more domain-specific areas without too much pollution of the common protocol.

A key reason to avoid putting too much stuff into it is that engineers new to the framework will often balk / fail to understand the abstraction if it has a ton of stuff, which is already a problem with ASLayoutable considering the stack-specific elements.  @nguyenhuy let us know if you have any ideas for how this could be improved (even if you can't do the change), because we only have about a month before we can't easily change it.

The essential issue is that, without these completion handlers, there is no guarantee that the UITableView's data is in sync with the asyncDataSource. You can handle some things by always relying on ASTableView (or ASCollectionView) as the source of truth for your data, but sometimes you just need them to be in sync.

Sorry about that guys — I'm not sure what's going on yet, especially since Paper and Instant Articles both clearly use non-default link colors and most certainly uses ASTextNode.

@mmiedlarz just want to say again how much I appreciate you uploading the test project.  It is very helpful to getting something like this fixed.  I'm sorry there's been a long delay on this, but as you can see there has been a lot of activity on the project with really big efforts, like adopting a big update to the text rendering engine and important internal capabilities like .interfaceState and .hierarchyState.  We are now starting to get to issues like this.

@samhsiung - I don't expect you to spend a lot of time looking at this, but since you recently figured out some really quite tricky issues with ASTextNode and attribute handling, do you think this bug might stand out to you?  There is definitely special handling of NSLinkAttributeName in the code, and that's probably to blame, considering that removing that attribute from the sample code provided causes the color to come through correctly.

548,2015-07-09 07:19:30,"This PR adds a new property for ASTableView (automaticallyAdjustsContentOffset) that, when enabled, will adjust the contentOffset for inserts and deletes before the visible viewport so the users view is maintained. In order to use this effectively, animations must be disabled while performing updates. To facilitate this an option has been added to endUpdates (and also a completion handler that has many uses.) Because this only works well with animations are disabled and it may require some thought to use effectively, it defaults to off.

You can see this in action with a simple demo app at: https://github.com/eanagel/ASDKVirtualizationDemo

There is a performance trade-off for this feature that I'd like anyone to weigh in on. In order to make this work, we need to know the heights of the nodes being inserted or deleted. (well we actually only need to know the heights of the ones before the visible cells.) I've extended our delegates to pass that information own to the ASTableView, but if it's not used it is a waste. These data is pretty easily available for inserting nodes, but in the case of deleting nodes, there is the additional overhead of capturing the deleted items and passing them down. There are alternative approaches I'm sure we could work out of this seems like it could be a big performance hit.

Additionally, this includes a **speculative** fix for a problem where ASDataController appears to be calling it's endUpdates delegate method before the didInsert/Delete delegate methods. The fix included here works for my tests but it does **not** pass the ASTableViewStressTest, so there may be more to the story here. I bow to @appleguy's wisdom on this one. See issue #564 for more details.

I think this handles the common cases for virtualization, but there's more that could be added to it to make it even more robust. Right now, it doesn't handle insertion/deletion of sections and you must explicitly disable animations in endUpdate to make it work correctly. If we wanted to make things more automatic we could separate the items that would be inserted before the visual window and make those insertions/deletions without animations (in a separate begin/end update block) and then follow up with any other updates in an animated fashion. It's considerably more work, but that would make this an ""it just works"" feature which I like ;)

@appleguy: thanks for the review. I'm not 100% sure of things here, since I'm not insanely experienced working with the responder chain, but here are my thoughts so far regarding your questions:
- layer-backed/rasterized nodes shouldn't ever care about becoming first responder, as this only really pertains to `UIView` hierarchies. To be more explicit about this, I now check if a node is `layerBacked` when calling `becomeFirstResponder`/`resignFirstResponder` and immediately return `NO` if so.
- I'm not really sure how to measure the performance degradation you're worried about. I don't know how UIKit keeps track of what views can become the first responder - presumably it tracks some kind of internal state on each view in the hierarchy to avoid having to recompute the first responder every time it's handling a touch event. That feels pretty lightweight in concept to me, but I suppose you could probably devise a worst-case scenario that might require traversing a lot of views when adding/removing children. Honestly, I'd be surprised if the responder chain was really a performance bottleneck when dealing with complex view hierarchies, but  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
- My intended use case is actually the same as #11 - I'd like to allow long-pressing on an `ASTextNode` subclass in order to show a `UIMenuController` and copy its contents. I'm currently doing this is in the app I'm working on (pointing at my branch of ASDK) and it's working well. Also, not sure if this really counts as a use case, but I've also updated `ASEditableTextNode` to implement these methods properly and it feels sane to me.
- I've added a couple of simple unit tests. They mostly just test that the default/subclassed/`layerBacked` behavior works as intended.

Ultimately, given that the changes here require opting-in via subclassing anyway, I'm in favor of merging early and waiting to see if anyone actually encounters any performance issues in practice, but I'm obviously a bit biased : )

514,2015-06-25 21:36:44,"This is a candidate fix for the race condition @appleguy tracked down in #458. This version uses the single pending `NSIndexPath` approach but adds code to validate that the pending index path is always contiguous with respect to `UITableView`'s `indexPathsForVisibleNodes`. (I had previously discovered that the approach of tracking all visible nodes using willDisplay/didEndDisplaying is flawed because `UITableView` doesn't always call didEndDisplaying. Boo. See #427)

In order to do this we may make up to two calls to `-[ASDataController  numberOfRowsInSection:]` but this _only_ happens when we have a pending index that is not part of the existing visible range (a rare but important edge case.) From what I've seen this happens pretty rarely and should not impact overall system performance.

I took great pains to validate the logic for the `isAfter(...)` method, so I think we are in good shape there. (It even covers odd situations like sections with no rows.) One caveat, if the pending value is an invalid `NSIndexPath` for our dataSource for some reason, weird things can happen. If we need to cover this edge case as well it can be done, but it would require additional calls to `ASDataController` to validate it.

The current master branch is now ""2.0 Beta"" because it includes his extensive changes to the layout system, which will significantly help us deal with this situation.

That said, this is an area where AsyncDisplayKit 1.x requires some manual work from the programmer to set -invalidateCalculatedSize and perform a new -measure / -layoutIfNeeded pass.  One reason is that the relayout could either be done synchronously or asynchronously, and the original framework didn't make an assumption about what is best for all apps when the frame changes (so this behavior forces the app developer to explicitly implement the desired behavior — after calling -invalidate, you can either call -measure on the main thread to block synchronously, or you can call it on a background queue to prepare the new layout asynchronously).

There's a new image modification block, `ASImageNodeTintColorModificationBlock()` — it was added by @andyscott in #283, and an argument could be made that we should delete the `tint` property in favour of it.

I think this is actually a reasonable justification to support image modification blocks on stretchable images, beyond simply maintaining consistency.  Deleting the `tint` option would further simplify this code path.  Thoughts?

369,2015-03-10 18:55:52,"I've run into a problem using ASCollectionView which is similar to what @ryanfitz describes here: https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/issues/344#issuecomment-77764729 and is probably a bug.

When you attempt to combine one of the update methods with another one the app will crash. ASDataController will call dataControllerLockDataSource from performDataFetchingWithBlock: on its data source for each group of changes (so once for deleteItemsAtIndexPaths:, once for insertItemsAtIndexPaths: and once for reloadItemsAtIndexPaths:). After the first call the datasource is already locked which will result in a crash on the second call because of the Assert in dataControllerLockDataSource in ASCollectionView.

I'm assuming this is not intended behavior. To solve this I've added a lock counter to ASCollectionView which gets incremented in dataControllerLockDataSource and only locks asyncDataSource on the first call. The counter gets decremented in dataControllerUnlockDataSource and unlocks asyncDataSource when the counter reaches zero.

I can create a PR if you guys think this is a good way to fix this.

EDIT: Just realized that in my solution it would probably make a lot more sense to add the counter to ASDataController.

The following race condition exists:
1.  image node enters fetching range, this `dispatch_async()` is triggered
2.  image node exits fetching range, `_cancelImageDownload` is synchronously executed
3.  this asynchronous block executes and image downloading continues

Let's move this dispatch out of the image node and into ASBasicImageDownloader, and let the downloader object be responsible for cancelling not-yet-executed download blocks.  We should probably also update the `ASImageDownloaderProtocol` docblock to require that implementations not block the main thread — we shouldn't work around this in individual nodes.  h/t @appleguy
",secretiverhyme,appleguy
362,2015-03-11 20:40:55,"> If you are on master, you can increase the working range so that the image can be downloaded much earlier. (See - [ASTableView setTuningParameters:forRangeType:])

Working ranges have been configurable since AsyncDisplayKit 1.0 via the `rangeTuningParameters` property, so you actually don't need to be on master to increase the range's size.  The API @lxcid mentioned will be released in ASDK 1.2 because we're now differentiating between ""rendering"" and ""network"" ranges — you can, e.g. enable 1-screenful render-ahead but 3-screenful download-ahead.

> ASDK does not provide a caching support for image but does provide hooks for caching to be supported through 3rd party implementation.

Note that if you're using the default downloader, your requests are cached — ASBasicImageDownloader uses NSURLSession, which uses your app's shared NSURLCache.  `[[ASNetworkImageNode alloc] init]` should Just Work™ out of the box; if you require a more flexible or explicit cacheing strategy, you can easily implement your own.  @ide's [WebASDKImageManager](https://github.com/ide/WebASDKImageManager) may also be worth a look.

@maicki, this change reproduces the issue. If the user initiates a drag, even though it will rubber band back into place, that will trigger the load. I think that is why this issue has not been widely reported. Probably the right thing to do is to use a new Hook from the ranch controller to check whether a batch fetch needs to be triggered, because the range controller runs its update pass in a variety of situations including edit operations and the appearance or disappearance of cells.

312,2015-02-13 00:32:39,"This PR introduces a new API for `ASTableView` and `ASCollectionView` to be notified when scrolling near the tail end of the available content. Notifications are limited to vertically scrolling near the bottom of `ASTableView`, and vertical and horizontal scrolling to the bottom and right, respectively, for `ASCollectionView`.

There are 2 new delegate methods for `ASTableView` and `ASCollectionView`:
- `-shouldBatchFetchForCollectionView:` returns a boolean to determine if a collection view should initiate the fetching process.
- `-collectionView:beginBatchFetchingWithContext:` is called when near the end of content.

`ASTableView`'s APIs are identical and differ only by classes and naming conventions.

The `ASBatchContext` object passed to `-collectionView:beginBatchFetchingWithContext:` has the method `-completeBatchFetching:` which **must** be called when finished fetching and processing your content. You can call this method synchronously, or after an asynchronous process such as fetching content from the network. 

If you fail to call `-completeBatchFetching:`, you will never be notified to fetch batch content again. This mechanism exists to prevent over-notifying and over-fetching.

The API adds `@property (assign) CGFloat leadingScreensForBatching` to both `ASTableView` and `ASCollectionView`, which defaults to 1.0. Changing this value will adjust the distance from the end of content that batch notifications will fire.

The Kittens project has been updated with an example of how to batch load content. The ASCollectionView project has been updated to simply demonstrate batch notifications with horizontal scrolling.

Unit tests are included, but this is the first iteration, so YMMV :smile:

297,2015-02-09 03:13:49,"@blessingLopes: @tanliboy might be better suited to answer this but i'll give it a shot:

When `ASCollectionView` begins to load your cells, it loads many `ASCellNode` objects at once and sizes them (I don't believe the process of allocating each is asynchronous and by this I mean each cell is allocated sequentially, but the layout and rendering is, someone can correct me on this!).  This means you'll see your `nodeForItemAtIndexPath` called consecutively until it reaches the end (does it still do this post-batch updating merge @tanliboy or is it only working range cells that get allocated now?).  Meaning if you're doing any image decoding (e.g. calling `UIImage(named: dataSource[indexPath.item])`)  in this call or in your `ASCellNode` subclass `init` method then it must wait to decode said images until it can continue and begin showing your table.  

Not only that, since `ASCellNode` is not reused, if you give the cell a strong reference to an image, it will live in memory until that cell is destroyed for some reason (like from a `reloadData` call).  This can bring a lot of memory pressure quick and In my experience caused an out-of-memory crash at some point once it begins to render many many images.

By moving your image decoding to a on-screen basis (and making sure to dump it from memory in either the exit hierarchy call or in an overridden `reclaimMemory` method) you cut all of that processing required to allocate and size each cell, so it can get to the whole showing your table part faster.

Maybe's there's an even better solution to all of this, but I haven't had too much time to experiment other then using the `willEnter/didExitHierarchy` methods.  Perhaps `didLoad` could work also?

Unfortunately, in order to support edit/update methods on ASTableView and ASCollectionView, we had to make data loading thread-affined:  if you call `-insertSections:` on a background queue, nodes will be processed on that queue, but when UIKit initially renders ASTV and ASCV, it processes nodes on the main thread.  For now, you need to start out with an empty data source and then add all content (e.g., using `-insertSections:`) on a background queue to avoid blocking with large data sets.  This is clearly not great, but improving it is possible now that editing support has stabilised.  =]

@kylehickinson, here's a bit of context on `-willEnterHierarchy`/`-didExitHierarchy` and friends (cc @rnystrom, who's working on the changes described here in #285):

We originally built AsyncDisplayKit as a necessary first step before building [Paper](http://facebook.com/paper).  The Paper story strip isn't a UICollectionView and its working range isn't powered by ASRangeController.  Since it isn't a UIKit component and isn't based on view reuse, its working range directly corresponds to ""everything in the view hierarchy"" — Paper keeps many card nodes offscreen, and uses `-removeFromSuperview` to keep memory usage in check.  `-didExitHierarchy` was therefore the logical place to free up memory (images, text rendering objects, and the like).

Of course, this design doesn't work in apps that use standard UIKit components and navigation!  Even scrolling through an ASTableView or ASCollectionView is enough to trigger many `-willEnterHierarchy` and `-didExitHierarchy` calls as the cells are reused (NB: ASCellNodes are not reused, but their containing cells are).  So, we replaced `-willEnterHierarchy` with `-displayWillStart` and introduced `-reclaimMemory` in lieu of `-didExitHierarchy` (79e65342b1b1273130392d75867ded5d793a7074).

This works for nodes that implement custom drawing, as ASTextNode and ASImageNode do, but it's only a first step.  For the ASDK 1.2 release, we're changing these subclass hooks to something like this (method names not final):

**rendering range** — formerly ""working range"", most people won't need to use these:
- `-displayWillStart` — called as nodes enter the working range and first start rendering
- `-clearRendering` — called as nodes exit the rendering range and should clear their backing stores

**network range:**
- `-fetchRemoteContent` — the appropriate place for custom nodes to load data, e.g., downloading images from the network
- `-clearFetchedContent` — called as nodes exit the network range and should clear their fetched content

This should hopefully be clearer and offer more flexibility.  It'll be possible to tune the rendering and network ranges, and they'll differ by default.  This will let you, for example, keep a small number of fully-rendered decompressed JPEGs around (`layer.contents`) but store a larger number of downloaded compressed JPEGs (`.image`).
",secretiverhyme,rnystrom
285,2015-02-05 02:28:49,"Awesome!  ~~Some~~A bunch of thoughts:
- Let's preserve the default asymmetricity of ASRangeController ranges.  The idea is for the bulk of render-ahead to be ""stuff you're scrolling towards"" (the ""leading"" parameter), with just enough ""stuff you're scrolling away from"" (""trailing"") staying in memory for the experience to not be jarring when you change your scroll direction.  I'd suggest that the render range stay 2 leading/1 trailing and the preload range become 3 leading/2 trailing.
- Our range-related methods are starting to look a little unwieldy.  There's currently no explicit `-render` method, but when we add one, we'll have `-fetchExternalContent`/`-purgeFetchedContent` and `-render`/`-reclaimMemory` balanced range entry/exit methods.  Introducing an allocation range will further complicate the matter (`-load`/`-unload`?).
  
  What do you think about adopting a ""verb""/""clearVerb'sResult"" pattern for these methods?  For example, we could use something like `-fetchData`/`-clearFetchedData`, `-render`/`-clearRendering`, etc.  This would also make it clearer what you're supposed to clear where.
- `-recursivelyPurgeFetchedContent` in ASDisplayNode.mm:L1355 recursively reclaims memory, instead of purging content.  :)
- Let's not make `-fetchExternalContent` automatically recursive — just like UIView's `-layoutSubviews` and CALayer's `-display`, most methods on nodes only apply to the receiver.  (We might want to revisit this at some point, but let's favour consistent-but-confusing over confusingly-inconsistent.  :D)
- Can we update ASMultiplexImageNode using the new API, mirroring these changes to ASNetworkImageNode?
- In ASFlowLayoutController.mm:L36, let's explicitly set tuning parameters for the render and preload ranges using the ASLayoutRange enum values -- if someone re-orders the contents of that enum, this code will silently start doing the wrong thing.
- What do you think about renaming `ASLayoutRange` to `ASLayoutRangeType` and the methods to `...ForRangeType:(ASLayoutRangeType)rangeType`, so it's clearer that we're passing in an enum value and not, for example, an actual range?

250,2015-02-02 19:03:51,"@toulouse — there's a simple answer to this.  Remember FBStoryNode?  It's just one example of many where a node hierarchy needs to contain a scroll view, and unless the UIScrollView is wrapped in a node, asynchronous layout will be interrupted for children of the scrollable region.

We addressed this in Paper by doing an initWithViewClass:.  We now have initWithViewBlock:, which is an improvement, but still—scrollable areas are such a fundamental part of iOS UI, that a scroll node fits right alongside ASControlNode, ASImageNode, ASTextNode, ASTableView, ASCollectionView...

Beyond the unambiguous utility (although it may not save a lot of work for developers, it is definitely going to be used and also does reduce client code while cleaning up style), it will also serve as an example for developers about how to wrap synchronous views.

That said, I appreciate you weighing in here and asking these legitimate questions as we are making API changes.  It is really great having more eyes on this.

Based on your comment [here](https://github.com/adly-holler/AsyncDisplayKitGrowingTextCellDemo/blob/master/AsyncDisplayKitTableCellTextView/ViewController.m#L29), perhaps your question is: why calling `invalidateCalculatedLayout` doesn't cause a relayout. The answer is that `invalidateCalculatedLayout` simply marks the calculated layout of the node invalidated. It neither triggers a relayout nor propagates the invalidation to its supernode.

I was a bit surprised when [calling -setNeedsLayout on the cell node](https://github.com/adly-holler/AsyncDisplayKitGrowingTextCellDemo/blob/master/AsyncDisplayKitTableCellTextView/ViewController.m#L31) works. The rule of thumb for relayout is that developers should call `-setNeedsLayout` on the node that causes a layout change, in this case it is the editable text node. Failing to do that usually would cause the (text) node to use its old cached layout. The reason your demo works is that ASEditableTextNode invalidates its layout in `-textViewDidChange` ([here](https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/blob/master/AsyncDisplayKit/ASEditableTextNode.mm#L421)). And that leads to 2 interesting questions:
- Should editable text node calls `-setNeedsLayout` instead? This actually makes sense and will make relayout more robust-- i.e any layout changes originated from an editable text node automatically trigger a relayout. 
  - The only problem I see is that `ASCellNode` must then somehow trigger an empty batch editing transaction (so that the hosting table/collection view will animate to the cell node's new size). This can be done either by a delegation or allowing `ASCellNode` to have a weak reference to the hosting table/collection view.
- Should we eliminate `-invalidateCalculatedLayout` completely? Or at least, for backward compatibility, make it to call `-setNeedsLayout` internally?
  - ~~One drawback of this approach is that relayout will be done very frequently-- i.e every time `-setNeedsLayout` is called on a node. We can fix this by scheduling the relayout to be done in the next layout call of the main run loop-- i.e the next time -layoutSubviews is called.~~

Would love to know your thoughts on this matter, @adly-holler, @appleguy and anyone else.

211,2015-01-23 00:00:01,"@wockerwalker — yes, we're planning changes to this behaviour in order to better handle large data sets (cc @rnystrom).  ASTableView and ASCollectionView currently blindly instantiate and measure _all_ available nodes as soon as they're available, but the ""a node is never onscreen if it hasn't been measured"" invariant can be preserved with incremental loading.  We're thinking of adapting the working range to only instantiate nodes when they're likely to be needed / destroy them as necessary for memory warnings.

For a stopgap measure, your suggestion of feeding ASTableView data in chunks — tail-loading, à la infinite scroll — is your best bet.  It's possible to have your code execute closer to display time using, for example, `-displayWillStart`, but this may actually be detrimental depending on what you're trying to do.

Hope this helps!  =]

Then in AppDelegate.swift of the sample project I added `import AsyncDisplayKit` and got the error when building the app (also got a similar error when adding `@import AsyncDisplayKit;` to an Obj-C file). Importing the Synchronized framework works fine.

At a glance, this architecture matches what I'd had in mind for a possible ASCollectionView — most of the core async logic can still be shared in ASRangeController, and this will make it easier to implement editing / updates support for ASTableView and ASCollectionView simultaneously.

One complication:  ASRangeController can compute working ranges for any single-axis scroll view (table views, flow layouts, …), but UICollectionView supports arbitrary layouts (like two-dimensional scrolling and panning).  It might be worth replacing `ASCalculateWorkingRange()` with a block property, so collection views can have custom working-range logic for custom layouts.

cc @appleguy — one of us should be able to do a more-detailed code review soon.

This feature has been rarely requested, but the fact that it's come up about three times now definitely indicates we should find a good solution.  Any thoughts from the community on the tradeoffs / requirements that we should define?

From my note to @tuyuan2012 --  I think it is possible to hook up the UIMenuController, though it is not very flexible and so there was some discussion about whether it would be best to build a custom callout bubble (that style of button selector). Are you wanting to use the full selection system with ASEditableTextNode, or just the menu controller with static ASTextNode ? Do you need to be able to use the selection handles to select a range, or just copy all in a given block? If you're able to upload an image of the case you're looking at in the UI that you'd like to implement, that would be a helpful guide for us to think through the possibilities (the two main branches being - integrate with UIKit's menu controller stuff, or instead just make something custom that is more flexible).

- Removed redundant `readwrite`
- No spaces between ""getter = name"" (""getter=name"" instead)
- Property method overrides renamed as well
- self.isBlah, while technically not entirely correct, still resolves to [self blah], so left alone (@kimon had advice on this sort of naming issue last summer), and largely inconsequential

- Compile and run
