In any case, that seems like a bug, no? I would expect to be able to change log levels at any time, or at the very least have the new log level take effect the next time a Realm is created. Same with the error handler.

At the very least, it's a documentation bug. There's no mention of this requirement in either the Swift logging section (which just says: ""The synchronization subsystem supports a number of logging levels, useful while developing an app. These can be selected by setting the logLevel property on the SyncManager singleton to the desired verbosity"") or the Realm Object Server documentation Logging section which is linked to from the Swift docs for more information (btw that link takes you to the top of the documentation rather than directly to the Logging section which made me assume at first it was a broken link until I found the section myself).",einsteinx2,bdash

>We should certainly update our docs to reflect that Alcatraz requires resigning Xcode.

I’m not sure that we need to mention how to resign or unsign Xcode 8. 
Without Alcatraz support and resigning/unsigning Xcode, we can successfully install RealmPlugin in Xcode 8(with release.zip)
Using Alcatraz is more convenient but it is not the mandatory to use RealmPlugin, I think. 
If some users want to install RealmPlugin using Alcatraz tools, 
they could get the solution from the Alcatraz repo.

Thanks ! ",freak4pc,bdash
4714,2017-03-05 21:50:10,"@bdash Was able to more accurately pinpoint the problem. This seems to be related to a situation where, if the Realm file was deleted after creation, consecutive `try! Realm(configuration:_)` won't create a new Realm file for some reason. 

I made a reproduction project, here it is: 
[RealmNukeExample.zip](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/files/819781/RealmNukeExample.zip)

A good way I could ""work around"" this for now is only destroy the realm if it's not empty, Or just deleteAll of the objects in the realm itself, instead of the Realm file. but I would still love to understand what's causing this.

Flow of things: 
1. AppDelegate initializes `OrderManager` singleton that creates the first empty realm (file exists) - `AppDelegate.swift:L16 , OrderManager.swift:L13`
2. Quite immediately after (on `viewWillAppear` of first view controller), the Realm file is deleted by a method that is supposed to make sure ""everything in the app is clean"" before initial onboarding - `ViewController.swift:L24`
3. Consecutive calls to create a fresh realm past that point don't help and the realm isn't actually being created. - `Realms.swift - Lines 19-29` 

If past that point, the next call won't have the delete (which my app won't for the second time), the realm will be created successfully after a restart of the app. 

Again, I highly appreciate your help!",freak4pc,bdash
4714,2017-03-05 22:31:37,"@bdash Thanks again. Is there anything problematic with just moving to an approach of just removing the objects of the realm instead of deleting the realm itself ? 

On the subject of deleting the file itself, Is there any way to actual understand which objects are ""retained"" in the Realm or perhaps a more verbose way to clear the cache in that situation? I assumed a `try! Realm()` always creates a new Realm file if one doesn't exist. Since realms can be created in many threads where the data needs to be accessed in, it might be tricky to actually make sure everything is closed in that specific moment.

Also, in the example I posted, There is no data inserted into the Realm, it is just created and then deleted so no references should be held from any of the objects, so just the empty Realm is cached? Perhaps it could be more verbose in creating a new realm and clearing the cache if the file doesn't exist at that path anymore? (clearly aware there is probably more to this I'm not considering)

I currently changed my `destroy` to a `THRealms.reset` method just clearing the objects. Is there anything problematic with this approach? 



Many thanks,

因为当前这个问题比较紧急，而当前的项目又不能单独拉出来发给你们。
目前我的处理方式：
通过先将数据库中的相关结果[这种数据比较少]查出来，放在内存中，然后在循环中对在内存中的的结果集进行filter。从而避免在循环里面对realm进行filter.
调整后，该问题暂时解决了。
暂时将改问题关闭，后续我会将单独拉出来的project发给你们。

For the first question, yes the crash always happens on `[RLMRealm realmWithConfiguration:error:]` `(RLMRealm.mm:271)`.

My assumption with this crash is that it happens when you remove a KVO observer from a RealmObject in the main thread and then delete that same realm object in another thread. 

If you could provide some insight into what the Realm stack trace is trying to do I may be able to modify my example code to reproduce it. From what I can see it looks like its trying to go out and notify its observers of changes. As I mentioned in my first post, if I remove the ""invalidated"" observer on the RealmObject on the main thread the crash no longer occurs.

DS: Am seeing the same issue - It feels like a  possible race condition - My code is almost exactly the same - the realm has just been connected but I am guessing there isn't any sync operation yet in progress so the `addProgressNotification` is returning nil (which it's documented to do if the block would never be called in the case of no outstanding work).  I wrapped my version of this in a main queue dispatch as suggested  with the same result. (see the Realm-ProgressAPIDemo - I just added a “FirstRunDemo” app to it whose job is to keep the login screen up with a spinner until the D/L  is done.  The first time it runs it’ll get a few records — but not al of them even though its set it `.reportIndefinitely` but 4 out of 5 times it’ll just return nil and never get the notification token

4619,2017-02-15 23:03:57,@austinzheng that was the motivation behind the `setPermissions` method on the `Permissions` object. Could also make it a static method but seems nice to me as a member method if you are changing existing permissions. I would imagine making subsequent requests to create permissions for the same user/url combo would overwrite the previous value.,alazier,austinzheng
4619,2017-02-16 11:06:28,"> Not sure why we would need two methods, one to create a PermissionChange object and another to set it. It isn't clear from the naming if it is creating a permission, or editing an existing one. Also am not a fan of passing in three booleans to specify permissions (prefer the bitmask). Otherwise looks fine!

- I went with the 3 nullable booleans, because I wanted to handle the case where we can leave certain fields unmodified. Alternatively we could have `setPermissions` and `addPermissions` methods or just another parameter `mode: Additive/Absolute` and go with the bitmask.
- I split it into two methods, because the number of arguments was rather large, but if we go with a bitmask, it's perfectly fine to combine in one method (yielding essentially what @austinzheng is currently proposing).
- I don't think people should care if it's creating a new permission or editing an existing one as long as it does what it's supposed to do :)

In my opinion, we should try to avoid making backend changes and work with the existing API instead. The reasons are that 1) we already shipped the existing API, so that should be supported, regardless of the changes we make and 2) it will require a lot more effort to change the backend in return for very little gain.",nirinchev,austinzheng

My guess on the implementation for @austinzheng proposal https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/pull/4619#issuecomment-280171907 is that it would still use `PermissionChange` underneath the hood, but that:

will require a new API to retrieve the permission state for another user, but I think it is a good idea.

I am more in favor of Austin's approach for the reasons listed above. It simplifies the concept of permission state and mutations, while all my additional comments show how it can be used in an offline scenario which a basic wrapper on the models fails to do so.",bigfish24,austinzheng
4619,2017-02-18 12:11:51,"@austinzheng how do you get the permission state for another user? Right now a user has his/her own permission realm for state and management realm for mutations. I would imagine the API to get the permission state for another user would need to be a new API that retrieves this from the admin realm. Also it seems unlikely that another user's state could be a Realm object that live updates since we already have some performance issues with keeping the user's permission state in the permission realm up to date, not to mention, I am not sure how that would work, where does this live object live?

From an API perspective I like it but after talking with @nirinchev last week I think we should be more pragmatic and just stick to the wrapper APIs on top of the current system, and focus on shipping since the permission realm is still not shipped for example.",bigfish24,austinzheng

For deleting and refreshing the realm file I need to clear, not only any references to Realm, but also to any object that is of type Realm.Object. If I don't do this, I have to kill the application for the content from the new Realm file to appear.

This means I can't pass persisted objects between viewcontrollers as you have no way of knowing when the viewcontrollers are dealloced (and the realm instance is freed).

An IPA of the app is sufficient. I can then re-sign it to work on one of my devices. It would be ideal if the app is built using the dynamic Realm framework (rather than the static one) so that I can replace the contained framework to test fixes or add extra logging.

> As for the usage pattern in question. The reproduction code above hits at least some bug in 2.2.0 and I highly suspect that fixing one will fix the other(both our app and the code above have no issue on 2.1.2 and a reproducible issue on 2.2.0. So obviously something changed in that version)

What leads you to believe that the cause of the growth in the test code is the same as what you're experiencing in your real application? The test code is clearly prone to the lock contention / fairness issue that I described, while you say it's not likely that your app is hitting that.

> One last thing, if my model of how the Realm file versions things and grows is correct, and what you're saying about the issue being locking is true. Wouldn't it follow that adding a [realm invalidate] at the end of the autorelease block in insertRun should have no effect? If we're being pinned while trying to perform a transaction and causing old copies to linger, then what happens afterwards should have no effect, correct?

>However, if you invalidate the realm there, the issue goes away. My understanding of the matter is that the autorelease pool should have had the same effect, except it doesn't, for some reason

One thing I _did_ just notice is that your `-realmFileSize` method opens the default Realm in a way that will result in it ending up in the main thread's autorelease pool. It's possible that this instance is what results in an older version of the Realm data being pinned, and that the explicit `-invalidate` you're adding works to close that Realm instance's read transaction and unpin the older version within the Realm file.

Then again, this is on the main thread so the Realm should be advanced to the latest version on each iteration of the main runloop, though I'm not sure whether that work would be scheduled before or after the main runloop's servicing of the main dispatch queue. The order matters since if the main dispatch queue is serviced first then the next invocation of `-testRun` will happen before the Realm is advanced to the latest version.",bdash,bdash

4554,2017-01-17 22:31:35,"@bdash Makes sense in terms of the complexity needed.
The manual version for such a computed property, for example:
var userCuriosity:EventCuriosity? {
	return from( curiosities ).singleOrNil{ $0.person.id == User.currentUserPersonID }
}

However the problem with not supporting such scenarios is that it makes the whole Realm architecture extremely fragely. We've had to compartmentalize Realm one refactor at a time to something that ""can't do too much damage"". The moment you can't use Realm filtering to store collections in its Results/Lists abstractions, you can't do fine-grained change notifications and need a custom mechanism there. Then you do that, you realize you can't communicate across threads – need to further compartmentalize there. Suddenly you need to hand-build everything because something is seen as ""complex"" and not supported, instead of rolling up the sleeves, tackling it, and understanding that without it you will not have partners succeeding on the platform.

Therefore I see this as absolutely critical for Realm to live up to its mission. Otherwise you have to re-architect your whole app (we have now twice) to get rid of Realm – making it very hard to re-architect again in its favour just to assess whether ""it's now ready yet"" – then discover it isn't.

Is there a solution where we could provide an arbitrary block to use for the sorting (this is also a scenario that's super critical). The trade-off could be sorting performance – FINE – but at least you could maintain the architecture desired for Realm to ""take over"" and model things the way you guys want them modelled. Re-architecture costs shouldn't be trivialized. You can launch any number of iterative features but if people can't add them on because they have been forced to architect in a different direction you will never have the adoption you need to make the features be used.

Points and cases:
- fine-grained notifications were launched but we had to build out own notification mechanism regardless
- Sub-path sorting was launched but doesn't support one-to-many. Therefore we had to build our own sorting, change detection and list-item update mechanism.
- Cross-thread object passing was FINALLY implemented (huge limitation from the beginning of Realm, so congratz to team there) but due to custom sorting logic missing we had to do this on out-of-bound objects anyways, on background threads as to not block UI, so an extra non-Realm model layer had to be introduced ANYWAYS - thus reducing Realm objects to dumb Data Access Objects, as opposed to rich model objects as they are intended.

These features should be set as P1's, above launch of hip ""synching platforms"" and all the other stuff the team's been working on lately (perhaps at the pressure of VC funding screaming down monetization down everyone's throats). An ORM, sync platform and enterprise services that are all Proof of Concept level across each pillar is much worse than having a single, battle-tested, production-level mature pillar that WORKS.

@bdash Does that mean every time I read data I'm pinning my thread? How do I release that lock? I do a lot of reads throughout my code. Some of those reads are on background threads.

And by that calling `realm.deleteAll()` removes the object from the Realm, but it´s still persist in memory due to to pointer from the internal Object?

`realm.objects(MyRealmObject).count` is `0`after executing `realm.deleteAll()`, but maybe the Realm Object still exists in Memory due to a (unknown) pointer from the internal Object?

Now in my second Code Sample I explicitly used `realm.deleteAll()` to remove all Objects from the Realm. This should have in fact solve the cascading delete Issue - but unfortunately there´s was another problem in my Code: A race condition with another write request for the same Object from a different Thread:

1. Thread A calls `realm.deleteAll()`
2. Thread B calls `realm.deleteAll()`
3. Thread A/B calls `realm.write`
4. Thread B/A calls `realm.write` - and there the crash happens, an Object with the same primary key already exists

So in the end there we're two causes for the error
1. `realm.delete(object)` is not enough, if there are linked Objects inside the Realm Object
2. Ensure simultaneous `realm.delete()` and `realm.write()` calls from different Thread on the same Realm-File are executed **without** interruption

4485,2016-12-27 23:47:08,"@austinzheng that looks like it fixed the problem of not writing the Realm file locally, but it does appear the connection gets closed quickly (preventing future syncs if the data changes)

The `upload` being denied made me assume that, for whatever reason, my app was attempting to write something (I'll see if I can find out why). So, I went ahead and gave the user `mayWrite` permissions for the Realm and now the connection isn't being closed — and ""it works"".

However, this seems to circumvent the goal (a ""readonly"" Realm that is synced locally to a client iOS app), and it makes me curious whether I'm trying to do something Realm wasn't designed to do?

From the docs, I'd assume I could achieve a behavior like this...

4481,2016-12-27 17:41:39,"Alright, I've done a little bit of thinking. I'm not 100% familiar with all of the inner workings of `Realm` just yet, but I see the problems that you've brought up and I have some ideas to start discussing.

> How can you make sure that this validation is applied even when Objective-C/Swift accessors aren't created? For example, when using KVC on Realm Collections, Objective-C/Swift classes are never created for the individual Realm objects whose properties are being modified.

What if we made the validation method a `class` method on `RLMObject`. It would take an instance of `Self` as a parameter and validate that object. Then, anywhere where we are saving/creating an object with KVC we can still call the class method. 

Alternatively, we could create some sort of pre-defined property validations and use some sort of annotations for them. If I'm understanding correctly, we could then map the validation on to the `RLMProperty` objects. I haven't done enough work looking at how `RLMProperty` objects are derived or utilized yet, so this isn't fully fleshed out, but I am going to look into it more. This is what I imagine it might look like if we go down this route:

`

> How should the concept of validation be enforced when not all changes to a Realm are being made through the Objective-C or Swift SDK? For example, if changes are made by the Realm Object Server or by other SDKs via synchronization?

I don't know a lot about this yet, as I'm not using the `Realm Object Server` personally. I can look into it a bit, but I'd love input from the team. If the validation was a part of the schema, rather than a custom validation function, would that be able to be synced over to the `Realm Object Server`as well and handled then? This seems like it would likely be possible if we implement the second proposed solution with the pre-defined validation.

This implementation would probably go all the way back to the `realm-object-store` repository. Which would be nice because it means that the implementation for the Java SDK wouldn't be too difficult at that point.

@jpsim Hope to hear your thoughts soon!",AnthonyMDev,jpsim
4481,2016-12-27 19:17:04,"@TimOliver From my example above, you may be able to derive some basic use cases for this.

My primary use case personally is for required fields. 
While `RealmSwift` supports optional or required primitive value properties, because of the introspection in Swift we can't make required relationship properties. The `.required` property validator would be very useful to me.

## Relationships

If I validate a relationship property as `.required`, I could then implicitly unwrap the relationship and feel pretty safe about it.

`dynamic var owner: User!` 

Now I don't need to unwrap my property with `if let` statements all over my application.

## String
Minimum length requirements on `String` properties can help make my code cleaner because I don't have to check if my `String` is empty every time I want to use it.

`

Now see how I use each of these when displaying my model object. In this example, I am displaying a `UILabel` with the string value, but if the string is either `nil` or empty, I need to hide the label. (For example, when using a `UIStackView` so that the label doesn't create empty space.

### Optional With No Validation

`

### Required With No Validation

`

### Optional Non-Empty

`

### Required Non-Empty

`

You can see that the versions in which I can already assume that the `string` is not empty are more concise. Over a large code base, checks for empty strings can add up to a lot of extra lines.

## Numbers

This same value added from the `String` example can be said for `Int`, `Double` or `Float` properties in which 0 (or any default value) would be used to signify a value that hasn't been set. `RealmOptional` works fine when you want to allow the value to actually be `nil`. However in the case where the property is required, but isn't set properly upon insertion, this will now throw an error, alerting you to the issue.

## Importing JSON

The most common use case for me personally is in validating that JSON data sets up my objects correctly. I initialize my object, map my JSON on to it, and then save the object. But what if I have a required `String` property and received invalid JSON that doesn't include the `key` for that property?

Currently, my object would save with the default value for the property (usually an empty string).

I hope that I have convinced you that my proposal would be a valuable addition to `Realm`. 

Thanks for your time.",AnthonyMDev,TimOliver

A quick win would probably be to keep track of the playback duration separately and update the Realm object when the video player is dismissed, but this would just take the issue a bit longer to surface. What is the reasoning for moving the transaction log into the realm objects itself and is there a way to clear / compact the transaction log? There must be information in there that is not needed?

From reading the earlier tickets I understand you are using the transaction logs for migrations? That would only mean schema changes right? I suppose the additional logs for write operations are there to facilitate rollback functionality? In the use cases for my app I would not need rollback support (only schema migration support) so it would be great if the extensive read / write operation logging could be disabled somehow.

Is there a way to log the realm size to the Xcode console?

I don't know if this makes sense, but could something like this be an idea to forcibly disable transaction logging for write operations?

I am getting crash reports indicating that these objects are getting invalidated at some later point, but much more rarely and I can't duplicate them so far.

Many of these crash reports are frequently associated with `NSArray enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:` which in turn uses `enumerateObjectsWithOptions: NSEnumerationConcurrent`.  I'm using that in many places indirectly from a library.  Could this be the underlying problem?

EDIT:  Actually, though the library uses `enumerateObjectsUsingBlock` the stack trace shows only `enumerateObjectsWithOptions`.  The only two *public* options are `concurrent` and `reverse`.  It may be that there is another private option that apple is using for synchronous operation, since `enumerateObjectsUsingBlock` says that it is synchronous.",timothycosta,kishikawakatsumi
4455,2017-01-02 06:04:42,"@kishikawakatsumi Below I'm including several logs where I'm receiving this exception.  After my last post I re-wrote that library I was relying on to avoid using `enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:` and since then I have crashed once with the same exception during`importLessonDetails` so perhaps that isn't the root cause.  This is not yet in production though.

Could you comment on whether the following two methods look safe, and what possible triggers of `Object has been deleted or invalidated ` could be besides threading and explicit deletion?

Importing objects:
1. Fetch `LessonMetadata` JSON from any of various server sources (search, feed, course list, etc...)
2. Create or update `LessonMetadata` from JSON using [+ createOrUpdateWithDictionary](https://gist.github.com/timothycosta/89e6a5461a21562fe0b64b47671aa88c)
3. Use a) `[realm addOrUpdateObject:metadata]` b)`[someRealmObject.lessons addObject:metadata]; ... [realm addOrUpdateObject:someRealmObject]` c.) both a and b together
4. *Never* call `[realm deleteObject:metadata]`
5. Always work with realm on the main thread except for one case [+ importLessonDataWithClient](https://gist.github.com/timothycosta/94812bec83ce7f8f40b4d3e001a5440e).  The crashes are frequently before this, though.

Using objects:
1. Import `Feed` which includes `Feed.lessons` and put lessons into an NSArray or reference them from blocks **
2. Import details a few at a time using that array (as in my first post)
3. Before 2 is complete, do 1 and 2 again (user refreshes list, etc...).  Refreshed `Feed.lessons` may not contain the same `lessons` as before.  Objects that are no longer in `Feed.lessons` may still be floating around the system, e.g. a lesson may be open or details are waiting to be imported in 2.

Stack Traces - All these are from the main thread:

Using `enumerateObjects...` - https://gist.github.com/timothycosta/856afecaf4fef5dc74f323e98e8892c3

But when there are animations involved (which due to the bugginess of UITableView are hard to prevent), you can get multiple overlapping updates where it reads the wrong value for the # of rows and gets into an inconsistent state. So I have to put updates and most importantly changing the value of the overall # of rows value into a different serial queue and use a semaphore to block until the animation is complete.

@tgoyne's comment just above mentions exactly how to do that: you can either not call `refresh()` or remove the notification blocks on `Results` or `List`s.

However, in general I think you may be using the wrong architecture for this. The whole point behind change notifications is that you can react to changes no matter where they originate from: other threads, processes, or even devices. Having a single point of change handling helps simplify and localize code.

In your case, it sounds like you're using both change notifications, as well as a callback mechanism to be notified when changes are available in other ways. I suggest you reconsider this architecture to simplify it to use this single point of change handling concept.

You can learn more about how to architect apps to be reactive and notification-based in our recent series of articles ending with [Live Objects and Fine-Grained Notifications: Updates with Realm](https://realm.io/news/live-objects-fine-grained-notifications-realm-update/).",jpsim,tgoyne

Allrighty, after a lot of head scratching I have progressed a bit:

I have narrowed down that the crash is happening in the setup of the realm config in 'didFinishLaunchingWithOptions'. At let _ = try! Realm()..

I use the following code to set up the default realm. I'm basically checking that the standard realm exists and if it does I move it to a shared location so it can be accessible from my extension.
This is the code for the setup:



This is how I was able to identify where the crash happened:
I got in contact with one of the affected users, sent him a TestFlight build where I stripped out the setup of the shared realm. I had then implemented a code that would locate the realm in the shared group container and send that as an attatchment to my email.

I now have that realm-file and it crashes the Realm browser when I try to open it.
Can I send this file to someone at Realm so they can identify what is happening? The file may contain user sensitive data.

",kevincador,bdash
4229,2016-10-17 21:30:11,"Hi @kevincador, looking at your sample code above and the modified version of the example app, you're effectively creating 10,000 concurrent versions of the database, each mutating the db. To preserve isolation between transactions, Realm writes this data in separate locations on disk.

Imagine if Realm didn't do that, you'd lose the isolation between transactions.

Realm preserves each intermediate versions of its state from the oldest still-in-use version (your main thread in this case) and the newest version (the last GCD transaction that fires). Meaning that these 10k copy-on-write versions of the database can't be discarded to reclaim that space.

This is exactly the type of problematic scenario that's documented in the section on [File size & tracking of intermediate versions](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#file-size--tracking-of-intermediate-versions) in Realm's documentation that @bdash linked to earlier.

If you weren't accessing the Realm on the main thread, those intermediate states could be discarded, preventing the Realm file from growing so much.
",jpsim,bdash
4229,2016-10-18 11:24:13,"Hi @jpsim,
I understand this and it would not be a problem if the file size didn't increase constantly. I mean, once the operation is done, there is no need to keep the intermediate versions in the Realm file.
Also, I thought the space would be reused at some point. It doesn't seem to be the case even with an autoreleasepool wrap or after calling invalidate after each transaction.

I think we are using a pretty common pattern:
- read on the main thread to refresh the UI
- write on a background thread after a network activity

The problem is, right now, we have like 30% of our daily user session that crashes with mmap() errors because the database is 1.5 Gigabytes instead of 6 Megabytes.

We tried to work around this by compacting the Realm file (modifying the source to have access to `compact()`) each time we launch the app but since we have other processes reading (like widget, background fetch or Apple Watch app) the compact does not always work.

When the compact doesn't work, we only found one solution. We delete all Realm files and trigger a full sync. Not the best in terms of user experience but there when there is no way to recover from a 1-3 gigabytes database (depending on the device), it is the best we could do.
",kevincador,jpsim
4229,2016-10-24 07:48:24,"Hi @jpsim, I would love to have your feedback about my last comment. Don't hesitate to ask me if you need anything.

I don't know if this makes sense but I think the database size grows a lot when we perform background fetch (iOS background fetch). It would make sense since I assume all the jobs are done in background threads. It would mean that no matter the use case, if you touch at the database in a background refresh job it will eventually crash at launch with an impossible mmap since the background refresh is triggered by iOS several times a day.
",kevincador,jpsim
4229,2016-10-31 14:33:16,"Hi @jpsim,

You could also delete the intermediate versions when the app starts up (or when the Realm file is first  accessed). I don't mind calling something else than compact() at launch if it can help reduce the size of the database. If it is a fast and safe operation, I don't mind calling this new method after each write transaction. 
",kevincador,jpsim
4229,2016-11-14 13:17:06,"Hi @diegomontoya, @bmunkholm,

I've done some refactoring (some heavier than expected) and we now have this configuration:
- Realm read from main thread -> ok
- Realm write from the app (local processing) -> all go through one `OperationQueue` which is backed by a serial `underlyingQueue`
- all other writes (sync, user action,...) -> all go through another `OperationQueue` which is backed by the same serial `underlyingQueue`

I saw some inprovement (🎉) meaning the Realm file size seems to not be as crasy as it was before after 3/4 syncs and 3/4 background fetch. But it is still increasing which is inevitable.

One thing I would like to double check with you guys is that the `Thread` on which the transactions occurs may be different (gcd still creates different threads in the queue even if it is a serial queue). I saw that the thread may be different especially if I go into background and come back to the app. Will this be a problem after running the app for a while? I assume the more the underlying Thread changes, the more we'll see the Realm file size increase. Correct?

4227,2016-10-18 10:39:35,"Hi @jpsim.
It's a bit strange for me, since I spent quite a bit of time thinking about providing such changes and didn't found any breaking changes in it. Let me clarify my point with a table:  

| Method | Current behaviour | Behaviour in my PR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| add(Object) (not exists) | Adds object to database | Adds object to database |
| add(Object) (exists) | Throws exception | Throws exception |
| add(Object, update: true) (not exists) | Adds object to database | Adds object to database |
| add(Object, update: true) (exists) | Updates object in database | Updates object in database |
| add(Object, update: false) (not exists) | Adds object to database | Adds object to database |
| add(Object, update: false) (exists) | Throws exception | **Skipping object with no changes and no exception thrown** |

As you can see, changes was made for one particular use case and it's hard for me to imagine any app that is hardly rely on a fact that add(Object, update: false) will throw an exception if object exists. I will be very grateful, if you can provide me real-world use case, when my change will really broke down something fatally. 
About your solution with checking if object exists - yes, it's not hard to make such change, but it will provide additional layer above database, as well as give overhead in object searching. As I can see in Realm code - when somebody wants to add object, Realm is performing search of row by ID. With your code such search will be performed twice: in my code at first and then internally in Realm. May be it doesn't seems to be a big deal, but I don't see any point in doubling of operations either, especially since our application is supposed to download thousands of objects from our API and write it to the database. 

As about wrappers - well, I can see your point. However, I feel like such limitation on List<> was here for quite a bit of time, so may be it's not a bad idea to give users of library a built-in solution, while you guys are working on correct solution? Also, I think it's possible to map Int to RealmInt internally, i.e. List<Int> would be mapped to List<RealmInt> inside Realm and problem is basically resolved, no? Yes, once again it's not hard to implement in application all this wrappers, but I personally hate boiler-plate code and I'm trying to avoid it as much as possible. I will not feel happy if I will be forced to repeat wrappers over and over again in every project that is using Realm or write separate library for this, which will require additional time spent on its maintenance. 
Hopefully, I made my point clear. I completely understand you concerns about my PR, but I doesn't feel like it's really something big :) Thank you for spending time on reviewing my code and I hope  you would think over about it once again :)

1. Reset Simulator contents and settings
2. Run tests on Simulator (I'm using iPhone 4S iOS 9.3) -> All tests have passed
3. Try to run app on Simulator (crash happens)

This also happens:
1. Reset Simulator contents and settings
2. Run app on Simulator (works fine)

When the unit tests run `TestRealmObject` is added the to on-disk Realm's schema.

So that is a documentation bug, the cocoa docs about when notification is fired stating ""This can happen when an autorefresh occurs, when -[RLMRealm refresh] is called, after an implicit refresh from -[RLMRealm beginWriteTransaction], or after a local write transaction is completed."" ?

Our app uses Objective-C and ReactiveCocoa, and crashes appear usually in `RACScheduler` blocks. So I do not see the possibility of ripping off a part of an app to use as a sample project, sorry.

It is important to understand why Realm instance with wrong `thread_id()` is written to `NSMapTable`.

In terms of the error handling, perhaps swallowing any exceptions on `Realm()` inside the method and returning nil in this case.  Thus `Dog(forPrimaryKey: ""x"")` is equivalent to `(try?

The example code workspace pulls in the Realm Xcode project, which will defaults to building everything with Swift 3. This means that the Swift 2.x example code would be broken out of the box on Xcode 8. Conditional compilation at least means that the example code would compile, but the user would need to tweak the Xcode setting to build the Swift 2.3 code path.

Also, given that this is a getting started document, maybe it'd make sense to have separate ones for Swift 2 and Swift 3? The #if blocks make the code a lot less friendly to beginners.

Yes. To do this right, we should duplicate the `swift-2.2` into a `swift-3.0` directory and update all the examples to Swift 3 in there. Also probably rename `swift-2.2` to `swift-2.x` since it should support 2.3 too.

Despite @bdash's last comment, I do think that we'd need to split it up, assuming we intend to include both Swift 2 & Swift 3 binaries in our release zips when Xcode 8 GM comes out.

You're right, it's not possible. But it's also not possible to specify more than one ""default"" Swift version to use in an Xcode project, so `Realm.xcodeproj` can't say ""just use whatever Swift version the client project is using"". So you'd need to modify that yourself ([`SWIFT_VERSION=2.3`](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/50c1effdec86bcc9a09fe66dc1bd090a303ea1d0/Configuration/Base.xcconfig#L50-L52)).

If a user creates an unsynthesized property that gets/sets an unrelated ivar, it think it's fair to treat this as a computed property unless they opt out. This is a very weird use case, and I think we should optimize for ease-of-use in the common case.

Just like we do not assume all properties are computed unless they explicit specify we should manage them, I don't think we should assume all properties should be managed unless they are ignored. It seems like a reasonable default would ignore properties without ivar backing.

The user simply must add an `as [RealmBoundObject]` to the parameter OR annotate the argument types in the closure. Again, in the case where everything in the array is of a common superclass, no type checker hints are necessary.

2. Rename `transactionWithBlock:` to `writeWithBlock:` and introduce `writeAsyncWithBlock:`; consider renaming `___WriteTransaction` family to `____Write` (aligning with Swift)
3. Keep the existing name and introduce `asyncTransactionWithBlock:` (no API changes, though harder to discover via autocomplete)

One workaround is to introduce an `initWith__:` method on `RLMLinkingObjects` and override this on the `LinkingObjects` subclass.

3763,2016-06-28 14:31:21,"I can confirm that this is a problem and could locate the root cause.

The problem here is that there is a name overlapping of the build product of the static library target generated by CocoaPods (`libRealm-iOS.a`) and the vendored static library used by the podspec (`librealm-ios.a`). Even though the name is not exactly identical, clang's linker is case-insensitive and uses the first matching according to the order of the `LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS`. As both are required changing the order doesn't help.

Usually the linter ensures that a pod can be built and included in a project. But it uses frameworks by default and doesn't additionally check whether a pod can be used in the integration mode with static libraries.

This must be fixed in CocoaPods. 

As an alternative workaround to what @stel proposed before, you could also declare `use_frameworks!` in your Podfile and use frameworks, while this will break backwards-compatibility to iOS 7.0 for distribution via the AppStore.

So to answer your question, yes the classes need to be declared prior to being able to use them as `RLMLinkingObjects` properties to satisfy the Objective-C compiler.

You can do this a number of different ways, as @kishikawakatsumi mentioned above.

You could also have all your models declared in separate files without their linking objects properties, and then in a separate file have class extensions that import the necessary models and expose the linking objects properties from there.

If these solutions don't work for you, please share your models and we'll help you refactor them for all this to work.

So there's a User model (User.h) that looks like this:



A current user model that inherits the User model



And then there is a Relationships.h file that, as I said above, links all the relationships between the above models and the rest of them in the application:



Everything compiles properly when I import the Relationships.h file (without it I get errors that the properties don't exist) however when I run it and call currentUser.feed for example it throws an error saying ""unrecognized selector sent to instance"".

Allow `Object` to be subclassed into generic types and require that all specializations be passed in to `Realm.Configuration.objectTypes` when creating the Realm.

I get the problem if I create a default Swift OSX application from Xcode and add the frameworks in. I've created a sample project here: https://github.com/dmendis/realm-test

As mentioned earlier, the app builds fine. It just fails immediately at runtime.

I ran `xcrun swift -version` on the Terminal and go this output:



Xcode Version is `7.3 (7D175)`
I don't have any other version of Xcode installed in the system.

If I drop the framework from `0.103.0-objc/osx/Realm.framework` there is no runtime issue. (Note ObjC)

> I'm still not 100% what that means ... is `deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded` only working if the schema version is same as last time? or something else? 

Yes. If you're bumping the schema version as well, you're indicating that you want to migrate your schema, which takes priority. The `deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded` is just the last resort if the schema doesn't match. This makes it a nice flag to set for development to avoid writing [a bit of tedious boilerplate setup code](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/3542#issuecomment-219453073), once you understood that schemas are fixed and migrations would be needed once you deployed your app for the first time.

@jugyo: No a migration block is not needed. This is only needed if you specify a schema version and bumping the schema version indicates that you want to delete the file.

",jugyo,mrackwitz
3583,2016-05-17 16:23:18,"cons about nr. 2 - if you're working on a newer version of your app, you have comment out the migration block in order to enable `deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded` - this will probably lead to a bunch of people not enabling again migration when they're finished with their code updates... 

If we get to choose in between the 3 proposed by @jpsim I'm leaning more towards nr. 3.

My personal preference would be to make `deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded` kick-in ONLY when there's no change in the schema version. The benefit of this behavour would be that this will prevent the situation when anyone releases their app with the property set to true and then their users will loose their stored date because of the `deleteRealmIfMigrationNeeded`. (Assuming people will remember increasing their schema version each time releasing a new app version)

The `RLMRealmTranslateException` function itself is only invoked in two places: when opening a shared Realm and when adding a notification block. In the former case the only errors that can be emitted are Realm-specific ones. I'm not sure yet about the latter case.

Getting Realm itself to throw a POSIX error is kind of difficult. They only seem to be thrown in `external_commit_helper.cpp`. I'm not yet sure how to induce a situation where `ExternalCommitHelper` would fail and throw an exception. I'll continue looking into it.

3494,2016-04-30 06:31:34,"> this limitation in Core Data was part of the motivation for designing it this way

Funny, and ironic. 😄 
What you call a limitation, I feel is an excellent feature (or lack there of). There were way too many times that I used this feature, and replaced properties with relationships in my NSManagedObjects, just to get NSFetchedResultsController to shut up.

In my experience, when dealing with the kind of massive UITableView or UICollectionView which display tens of thousands of items, and have even slightly moderate complexity (eg. lets say variable heights on cells), the less frequently you update them the better (on older devices updating even a single row in such a tableView with just 2-3 thousand existing rows can be expensive). Which means not updating them when a random property (that you're not even showing in the cells) updates.

You're absolutely right in saying that being notified of a change to a related object in Core Data would be incredibly hacky and underperformant. But, the beauty of Realm is that it is not Core Data, reading persisted properties & traversing relationships is so fast that I pretty much never have to worry about performance. While using Realm, I do in-memory filtering on tens of thousands of objects. Something that I wouldn't even dream of doing in Core Data. My point is that, if Realm did not provide notifications for changes in related objects, and I needed them, my workaround would be hacky, but not underperformant.

It might take me a little while, but I will be happy to provide you with a sample project that demonstrates the performance issue that I brought up.

Finally, I can pretty much confirm that it was the manually managed bi-directional relationships that was the cause of excessive CPU usage in the notification listener thread (and the un-needed modification notification as already confirmed by @tgoyne). I changed my models to use the newly merged linking object property, and both issues have vanished.

At this point, my only request for you guys would be: If you ever decide to address this bug of modification notifications not being posted for 'linking object properties', please first consider adding, at least as an option, the ability to disable notifications for changes to related objects.

PS: Again, I will try and provide a sample project which demonstrates the performance issue that I brought up, as soon as I can.

According to Crashlytics the users having this issue are not jailbroken.

> A bad Realm file header indicates a corrupted file, which can happen if non-Realm APIs were used to touch the file at all. This commonly happens when users attempt to replace, delete or update a Realm file using system file manager APIs while continuing to access the file using Realm APIs.

It would be strange that the reason for this is file manipulation, specially considering that this started happening exactly after updating to a newer Realm version. 

Maybe this is indeed related with https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/3422, where users that had that problem are now left with a corrupted file, despite @bdash's intuition that there's no relation. I would try to reproduce it but besides being intricate, chances of being able to actually reproduce it are slim - I'd need to somehow create a realm file pre-0.96.2 for an older schema version, then 'update' to 0.96.2 and to the latest schema version, run the migration and hope for #3422 to appear, then update to a newer realm version, create a release build, run the app, and hope for the bad header issue to appear. 

If there's suspicion from you guys that there could be a link between these two I can try - otherwise, any other suggestion? Last resort I will just recreate the file when this exception happens, but I'd like to avoid that, anything not synchronized to our servers at that point will be lost.

> > Have you done any thinking about restricting the number of backlinks to only 1?

We could offer a shortcut to an optional first backlink, equivalent to `LinkingObjects(fromType: Person.self, property: ""child"").first`, but I don't see the value there for the same reasons @bdash shared.

> Objective-C `RLMLinkingObjects` properties are `nil` for standalone objects, but Swift `LinkingObjects` cannot be. How should we reconcile this?

Return a `LinkingObjects` backed by an empty RLMResults? I'd actually say that'd be preferable to `nil` in Objective-C too.

> Do we need to support KVO on linking objects properties in the initial implementation?

Without reviewing too deeply, I'd suspect this already works with KVO when tracking top-level results properties like `count`. If it's not too much work to assess what's missing for more complete KVO support, it'd be nice to at least do that before we determine whether or not it's worth the investment. At the very least we should track completing KVO support as a GH issue if we decide to punt on it.

> Is there a nicer way to declare the properties in Objective-C?

We could introduce some sort of `RLMLinkingObjectsDefinition` class in Objective-C which would likely avoid some user issues with remembering the NSDictionary format:



Naming alternative could be `RLMBacklinkDefinition` depending on if we want to use that term at all.

> Is it ok to make `Results` non-final? Can we avoid it?

We could avoid it by typaliasing `LinkingObjects` to `Results`, which would be nicer in some ways, worse in others.

> What should we do with `Object.linkingObjects(_:forProperty:)`?

I'd vote to deprecate it too.

To address your remaining checklist items, yes I think it's fine to make Results non-final, there's not much users can do to hurt themselves by subclassing Results.

I don't think many people would prefer 1970/01/01 9:00:00 than the old value.
If it is too specific to our case, maybe some warnings or documentation on this behavior would be helpful, because 1970/01/01 9:00:00 was specified nowhere in our project and the migration ended without any warning/error log.

In short, the problem (for us) seems to be related to an NSURLSession dispatching the delegate methods on the `.mainQueue()` if supplied on session creation.

When we then write download progress to Realm in `func URLSession(session: NSURLSession, downloadTask: NSURLSessionDownloadTask, didWriteData bytesWritten: Int64...)` and at the same time listen for changes via a notification block for a results set on the same queue, the `BadVersion` error almost\* always occurs.

_(dangerous because one can then modify the persisted Realm… even from a detached, standalone object, simply by traversing a relationship)_

@jpsim typical use case if that helps you understand the need for this:



`standalonePerson.realm` is nil once detached from the Realm, but `standalonePerson.dog` isn't detached, so the dog gets modified in the DB even if the `Person` _is_ detached from the DB

3381,2016-09-27 06:56:34,"@SandyChapman the use case here isn't too pass an object across threads. It is rather to do a deep copy detached from any Realm in order to create a standalone object for example.

See the detailed use case example I gave in my previous comment above: the need there is to manipulate a copy of the object rather than the original to be sure not to alter the original and/or its dependencies. (This could also be seen in a user case similar to CoreData's concept of ""child managedObjectContexts"")

This can be addressed by renaming the columns of deleted properties to a unique ID at the start of the migration, and maintain a map of names/uuids to use in the renaming operation.

I think it's necessary to remove all new schema validation altogether because of this, and other multi-version schema change scenarios.

How about falling back to looking up the property by name in the new Realm? This would allow the following scenarios:

As far as I can tell, because you're holding to a Realm instance outside the autoreleasepool, there's no guarantee that `dealloc` will be called when you set the variable to `nil` or when your explicit autoreleasepool is drained at the end of its scope.

Try calling `realm.invalidate()` before setting it to `nil`. It's a private method on `RLMRealm`, so you'll have to re-expose it in a category interface.

3222,2016-03-22 14:17:53,"@jpsim @tgoyne 

There are two places where schema validation will fail.
One is here: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/master/Realm/RLMRealm.mm#L350

It is in the `Realm::init` method that is called from `openSharedRealm` method.

Another is here: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/master/Realm/RLMRealm.mm#L374

The former is called when a schema is specified with `objectClasses`,  the latter is called when that the schema isn't specified.

The problem is, the latter is called directly from the Objective-C layer, so  it is difficult to handle deleting and re-creating the file. It is also difficult to replace the Realm instances within the method.

Also it is difficult to determine whether the caller is former or latter. 

Do you have any thoughts?
",kishikawakatsumi,tgoyne
3222,2016-04-15 18:45:48,"@tgoyne @bdash 

I need your advice. What do you think I should do?

It seems difficult for me that deleting Realm file when migration is needed is done within the ObjectStore code.

Schema validations are done in two places. 
The former is done during the initialization of the Realm instance. It is difficult to re-create Realm instance in this timing since the initialization method has an exclusive lock.

The latter is done much after the Realm was instantiated. So it needs to return the method to the Objective-C++ code to release and re-create Realm instance.

We found a crash on crashlytics during beta release and had to identify who was the person who had that, he said that never faced any crash during the beta and we realised that was something related to the notification that awakes the app in background. 

Now we added the flags and released a new version following what we spoke in this thread. And wait a bit to see if fixed or not, as replicate is quite difficult.

I don't think that this is actually possible. If the directory is protected, it should be encrypted when the device is locked. If `NSFileManager` could bypass that, this would be a security loophole.

> I like the idea of adding a file attributes property to `RLMRealmConfiguration` to handle the protection properties of all files related to a Realm instance.

Setting the default file attributes for newly created files won't be enough though. I think we would need to check the parent directory instead. One problem here might be that there could be likely any arbitrary other user files adjacent to the default Realm path, which should be better protected in some cases. So just removing the protection by default might not be the best solution. (Perhaps we should think about scoping the default Realm path by another directory element, so that it is easier to workaround this case?)
We could also have a property `backgroundAccessRequired` on `RLMRealmConfiguration`, disabled by default, but when enabled Realm would fail gracefully directly on first open with instructions how to make sure that the parent directory is not protected. As this is a security critical API design question, we should make sure that the behavior doesn't imply implicit side-effects, which are badly understood but cause risk of exposing sensitive user data accidentally.

We're calling a method on a struct to set our default Realm configuration straight from our `applicationDidFinishLaunching...` method in our application delegate, which fires on the main thread. It's the second thing to get called after setting up our logger.



This part executes fine, but the moment we try to `.write` something to our Realm (from a background thread; this is the first time anything hits our Realm on any thread), we get the same error as @kevinmlong.





This happens well after we setup our default Realm configuration — in fact, we don't write anything to the Realm until _after_ a user initiated action (in our case, a login event). Bumping our `schemaVersion` to 8 produces the same result (much as I'd expect it to, since this happens on a fresh install). If I force all of our Realm `.write` calls to happen on the main thread, we _don't_ get the error, and everything works rather swimmingly.

@kevinmlong let's start with your issue, and what you've shared of your project with us, first:



You say this logs the following:



which would seem to me is impossible given that passing a lower version number than what's currently set in the Realm file on disk will throw an exception at runtime, which is then converted to a Swift error in the `Realm` initializer, preventing that version from being set: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/v0.98.3/Realm/ObjectStore/object_store.cpp#L364

My limited testing confirms that setting a lower schema version number than set on disk throws a Swift error. If you were to share with us a complete sample project that can trigger this strange behavior you're experiencing, we'd be able to troubleshoot further. Otherwise, we're stuck here.

@kreeger I think something else is happening in your case.

> We're calling a method on a struct to set our default Realm configuration straight from our `applicationDidFinishLaunching`... method in our application delegate, which fires on the main thread. It's the second thing to get called after setting up our logger.

Note that `applicationDidFinishLaunching` is often not the first part of your code that runs in a Swift app. If you have any code that touches a Realm in properties with default values of view controllers that are loaded by storyboards, those will access the Realm before `applicationDidFinishLaunching` has a chance to run.

This could explain the `Realm at path already opened with different schema version.` exception you're seeing, as those properties with default values could be accessing the Realm prior to the `setupRealmAndMigrateIfNecessary` function being called, so when you come around to making the migration, the Realm is already open with a different schema version.

If this is not the case, we'll need more information to troubleshoot with you.

Here is my situation. I am keeping two realms synced between iOS and watchOS. In my model, there are subclasses inheriting `Object` and a particular class `Journal`, keep the operation records of the other `Object` subclasses. All Realm objects have an primary `id` in Int64



I use `Journal` to sync between iOS and watchOS. Base on the using pattern of my app, the `Journal.id` is extremely rare to be the same between iOS and watchOS when syncing. So I don't tend to compare whether the ids are duplicated in my own code, I want to rely on the throw error. 



In current Realm, there is no such mechanism to do what I want. So I say it is not friendly. I have to test the ids myself, which in most situations, will pass, which means unnecessary work, in my option.

3136,2016-06-24 22:06:42,"@jpsim The `asyncWrite` function must provide a completion block so that asynchronous errors (on commit after the write block is executed) can be handled. Since most users would probably ignore the error in the completion block, we ought to provide a default implementation that aborts. Unfortunately we are unable to show variant may fail (like the `try!` annotates with synchronous write), but this is a limitation of Swift.

I propose the following functions for the no-parameter and single-object-parameter cases. I agree that the multi-object-parameter variants are also useful, but I would first like to discuss the simpler cases.



Note that the completion block is provided in an overload rather than a default parameter so that users can use trailing-closure syntax in the non-handling case.

It's not straightforward how this API ought to translate to Objective-C. If we wish to provide ""default"" arguments for `queue` in the Objective-C API, we have to provide 2x as many functions, and there are already quite a lot. If we do, I think something like this might be reasonable, but I'm not very happy with the number of ""overloads"".

3136,2016-06-28 21:11:25,"Speaking with @JadenGeller about this just now, I'd like to add to the bikeshedding:
1. Why not avoid adding new ways to handle errors and reuse the ones we already have?
   By making async read transactions (though they have little value on their own), we
   can let users reuse the write methods and associated error handling that they're
   already familiar with.
2. By forgoing variadic arguments, we can use `SequenceType` and preserve the common
   denominator type. In other words, pass in `[Model1(), Model1()]` and the block vends
   an objects of type `[Model1]`; pass in `[Model1(), Model2()]` and the block vends an
   objects of type `[Object]`. Same thing for `RealmCollectionType<T>`.

Here's a small Swift Playgrounds that can serve as a proof of concept:

",JadenGeller,jpsim
3136,2016-06-28 21:23:17,"Elaborating on @jpsim's suggestion, this API design doesn't require us to provide a completion handler.

3116,2016-01-27 23:42:10,"@tgoyne That makes sense, and I thought about doing something like that as well.  However, wouldn't it make more sense to just delay all KVO updates until after commitTransaction is called, even on the same thread?  Otherwise, theoretically any code that could ever be touched via KVO would need to be peppered with checks for whether you are already in a writeTransaction.  Should I already be doing that?  It would be simple enough to create a category with a block which would do that, but it seems a little dirty to me.

By the way, this section of the documentation is a little bit confusing.  ""When you directly assign to it"" to me reads like ""when you assign outside of a write transaction"" (which you shouldn't be doing anyway, unless I'm mistaken).  Something like ""as soon as you assign to it during a write transaction on the same thread"" might be clearer.

> With persisted objects, there are three times when the value of a property may change: when you directly assign to it; when you call [realm refresh] or the Realm is automatically refreshed after a write transaction is committed on a different thread; and when you call [realm beginWriteTransaction] after changes on a different thread which have not been picked up by a refresh on the current thread.

There are 2 possible places where this can be happening on our code from a write:
1. DB compact on start up
2. Write in background

Here is our code that we run when the app launches to compress our DB file size:



Our `Configuration` class is just a object that contains information about which write and callback queues should be used when accessing Realm and the Realm.Configration that we create for each store. We abstract our realm access behind a `PersistentStore` class. The `Realm.Configuration` we create is versioned w/ a migration block and specifies which `Object` types should be managed by the realm instance. (if need you to see this code, let me know)

Our Realm abstraction (e.g. the `PersistentStore` is a generic class that will manage a single object type. We encode/decode the objects to our own entity models so we do not have to have our resources extend the Realm instance. Here is a basic example:



Then each `PersistentStore` will manage a pair of these:



Now we can store instances of `Foo` using the `fooStore` and the `PersistentStore` will handle the encode/decode of to the actual Realm `Object` that is stored. Here is the code for performing a write using the `PersistentStore`:

As for why we are wrapping Realm API's with our own, this is purely for abstraction reasons. The idea is that we don't let the Realm API bleed out of our PersistentStore API this way if for any reason we needed to switch to a different DB we could just by refactoring the PersistentStoreStore implementation. 

We are also using promises (PromiseKit) heavily so we wrap our code (which isn't illustrated in the above code samples), but with wrappers around Realm API's we can provide promise based writes which is very nice for caching purposes:

I've got an app update currently waiting for Apple review that fixes some version-pinning and related issues that I identified in how we were interacting with Realm, as well as gets rid of a long-lived Realm reference that we really didn't need. My hope is that once that goes out to our users there will be a drop-off in Crashlytics reports coming in.

3021,2015-12-30 14:56:00,"hi @mrackwitz , sorry for the late reply.
to better describe the issue i have, lets assume we have entity `movie` which is `RLMObject` subclass, what i have here is 2 tabs application, at the 1st tab is displayed `favourite` movies, which is like:
|--View <---> ViewModel.RLMResults --| 
`RLMResults` here is objects in realm with `favorite = true`

then in the 2nd tab it's a list of all movies weather `favorite = true` or not, so whenever i favorite item from the list ( 2nd tab ), when i go back to the 1st back the newly favorite item is there without reloading ( on simulator ) meanwhile it doesn't appear on the device.

`UITableViewDatasource` methods are getting data from viewModel, e.g :

3021,2016-01-11 16:10:54,"hey @mrackwitz ,
the `viewModel` here is an `RVVM` subclass, `reactivecocoa`.
the issue was strange, that behaviour was on iOS simulator 8.2, but when i tried with 9.x simulator it behaves exactly like the device, so the only explanation i can think about now that simulator version 8.2 was reloading `tableView` at some point, most probably `-viewDidAppear`.

I created reproducible sample project https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/Crash_Destruction-of-mutex-in-use/

#### Step to reproduce
1. Clone the repository and launch the app.
2. Wait for a few minutes (1-10 minutes) until the app will crash.

#### Note:

It is easier to reproduce on devices than simulators.
On devices, `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` in `advance_transact` was occurred in my environment.
On simulators, `Destruction of mutex in use` or `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` in `advance_transact` were occurred.

It seems to send a notification to the freed Realm instances.
According to the screenshot below, the app crashes on thread 5. At this time, the Realm instance is deallocated on other thread whenever (Thread 10 in the screenshot). 

The Realm instances on thread 5 and thread 10 were same (`0x0000000161c7fbf0`).

I think that's not quite true - to be nitpicking I think it's really allowing one ObjectId per _model_ (aka `RealmObject` sublass) **per Realm** which can be null?

Say you have more than one Realm open with some of the same model classes in them, as you might in a complex manual migration scenario. Different, unrelated objects in different realms can have identical `ObjectId` values. These include one null per-Realm.

When you commit a write transaction on a background thread, a notification is then sent to other Realm instances on other threads (this works through a named pipe) to refresh to the latest version of the DB that includes the recently committed transaction. The problem though is that notification is processed on the receiving thread only during the default run loop mode. When you are scrolling, the main thread will run in NSEventTrackingRunLoopMode for that pass of the run loop. This means that Realm's notification will not be processed until the thread is back in default mode.

Just to confirm, `PFUser` is a Parse subclass and `FLPerson` is a Realm subclass; is that correct? Also, what type of class is `FLUser` then?

How much of the implementation code for `FLPerson` are you able to share? I'm curious to see what happens in the `[FLPerson initNewContact:]` method call.

If there are three or more objects, even if you delete the objects without any relation to the query, the result will be wrong.

For example, add `person3` to above code:



Query for `person3` object,



Then delete `person1` object, the results will be empty unexpectedly. Because the row index has shifted.

That's because polymorphism isn't supported yet. You can just store objects of a specific type.
You could follow though the second suggestion of having dedicated lists for each enumeration case.
Alternatively you can also introduce a wrapper type, which can bind all sorts of associated values and have your computed property on this type:

2743,2015-11-03 20:11:30,"## Summary of Discussions

As this verification is very specific, we should think of whether we could do that in a more general fashion at a different place. There are different options, which I want to layout here, so that we could decide on whether we settle on one of them or don't do any verification like that at all. It all boils down to enforcing our modified `RLMObject` class contract in differentiation to the expectations given from Foundation/Cocoa/`NSObject`. For all options, it could likely make sense to reduce the performance impact by executing them only in the Debug configuration and so not affecting distributed builds of the user's apps.

### Variant A: Check type on initial / every value access

Instead of relying on KVC directly via `valueForKey:`, we could instead encapsulating retrieving the properties value in a method / function. This could then contain further type verification and assert when the type conflicts with the expectations.

### Variant B: Scan & forbid overwritten alternate KVC accessors

As Realm implements custom accessors on `RLMObject` subclasses, we could just completely forbid users to implement alternate KVC methods. (e.g. `is<Key>`, `get<Key>`, …)

---

Thank you so much for sharing that, it's really clarified what's happening. There are two bugs here. One of them is in our code, the other is in our documentation ;)

The bug in our code is that we're using the schema version set using [RLMRealm setSchemaVersion:...] rather than the one provided in the configuration object. We've already submitted a fix for this and it will land in our next release: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/pull/2680

The bug in our docs is that the following sentence is wrong:

> Accessing a Realm file created with a previous version will automatically convert these properties to nullable in the file itself, unless explicitly marked not to do so in +requiredProperties.

Although accessing the Realm file will in fact update the file format, the properties won't be converted to nullable until you perform a migration. We'll be sure to update the 0.96 release blog post and our docs to reflect this.

Thanks again for sending this our way.

Do you have any suggestions for handling this frequently, or do you think we should rethink our approach to handle the impact of all do/catch (or try! 🙈) ?

We haven't shipped a version with RealmSwift yet (and we will migrate to Swift 2 before we do), but we did not use the old error handling model more than at the start of the app before, so this comes as a quite big change for us.

I'm using code generation to generate a Swift client library from a RESTful Swagger document. This is producing a bunch of code where after a REST call is made, the response is parsed into a bunch of nested objects which conform to Realms requirements and inherit from RealmSwift.Object.

At the top level of most of my calls is a hypermedia based object which supports pagination. This does not have a primary key, but the content embedded within the paginated object does have primary keys. I'd prefer to call ""add(:update:)"" on the paginated object which ignores the fact that some objects may not have primary keys and thus will have no effect rather that iterate through a potentially complex data structure adding / update keys manually.

So in short, yes, I think your suggestion that the behaviour described for `createOrUpdate:` would make sense.

- Realm 0.96.2 (`pod Realm`, ObjC)
- Xcode 7.1

We just switched to `use_frameworks!` (because we'll need a Swift pod soon) and now when archiving, I see it building the `.mm` files from Realm but when linking the framework sources at the end it generates the following:



And I checked just to be sure, `ENABLE_BITCODE` is set to `YES` on the `Realm` target of `Pods.xcodeproj` as expected (as well as on every other targets and my app).

Of course setting `ENABLE_BITCODE` to `NO` everywhere (in app + in pods via post_install hook) avoids the problem but is not ideal.

I removed Realm and reinstalled it with xcode-select set to Xcode 7 and now have the BitCode-enabled `librealm-ios.a` :+1:  Thx for the tip!

Note that I think it's better to suggest users having the same problem to simply comment `# pod 'Realm'` from their `Podfile`, run `pod install` to uninstall it, then uncomment it and run `pod install` again to force the reinstallation of the pod, rather than suggesting to nuke the `Pods` folder, which would remove the `Podfile.lock` and all the pods locked versions.

Nuking the `Pods` folder will have the side effect that the next `pod install` might install latest versions of other pods when we sometimes don't want to update right away and want those pods to be locked on a specific version until we `pod update` them explicitly. Uninstalling just the `Realm` pod and installing it again doesn't generate this side effect, except just for the Realm pod itself.

> Once your app is built for release, Realm should only add around 1MB to its size.

I'm curious as to why it worked the last time I checked... maybe I tried with an OS X project?

In any case, I think the first thing to do here is to file a radar with Apple at bugreport.apple.com indicating this is a regression. Then we can look into ways that we could work around this from within Realm Swift itself.

Until then, you'll have to use the workaround described by @bdash above.

",kspangsege,jpsim
2459,2015-08-29 17:46:15,"@jpsim, is the following interpretation correct?

From an abstract point of view, there is a fixed schema which goes through a sequence of updates over time (`S_1`, `S_2`, `S_3`, ...). Each of theses updates are exclusively additive (e.g., no attribute removals). Apps (`A` and `B`) will be working with static object types (custom classes with statically specified attributes). The apps will be stepwise upgraded to match the schema changes, but they must be able to cooperate even when they are not upgraded to the same point. For example, if `A` is at `S_1` and `B` is at `S_3`, `A` and `B` must still be able to cooperate.

Contrasting alternative 1: There is no fixed schema. There are no custom object classes with statically specified attributes. Apps (`A` and `B`) work exclusively through a dynamically typed API, and may perform additive schema changes at any time.

Contrasting alternative 2: The schema is partially static and partially dynamic. For example, all objects have properties `P` and `Q`, as well as a dynamically increasing set of additional properties. Apps (`A` and `B`) will always agree on the static part. Properties `P` and `Q` are accessed by means of statically specified attributes in a custom object class. Other properties are accessed via a dynamically typed API.

Having a huge JSON dictionary with only 1 or 2 key missing, it would really be a PITA to affect the properties and relationships (recursively) one by one manually… just because of this.  
And mutating the dictionary before calling `initWithValue:` (only workaround to far) is far from ideal either (string-typed + not this code's responsibility to know the JSON keys anyway)

I might keep it in mind and see if there's a better way to do it (Even if it means some kind of direct communication between the plugin and the Browser).

I reviewed your code, and that looks like the best solution at present to me. That'll cover the portions of the multiple file handling operations that weren't getting covered on Realm Browser's side.

@jpsim I'm happy with this pull request. Shall we merge it in?

Both Classes (Parent and Child) have a primary key and both keys are set (NSUUID as String). Now everything works fine, but if I update the child of the Parent using the Property ""MyChild"", the actual child value inside the Realm get´s update, but the relationship to the Parent is lost. Therefore I had to add the Line ""_myChild = myChild"" directly after the update. I guess this is the same ""wanted"" behavior like the other examples above. 

Isn't there any way to update the Child Property without manually restoring the relationship? This Behavior is really error prone and generates substantial overhead (This is a small Example, my 'real' classes have much more Properties / Code).

@TimOliver mentioned in his explanation that the object doesn't know if the child / relationship is  intentionally nil, or merely unset. But what I don't understand: I never set the child Property to nil, so why get the relationship destroyed by the update?

I also removed the full constructor from `RLMRealm_Dynamic.h` (it still resides in `RLMRealm_Private.h`), and then also moved the dynamic `RLMObjectSchema` method and `RLMProperty` method to their private headers.

The result is that the only methods that are being exposed via `RLMRealm_Dynamic.h` are the dynamic retrieval and dynamic create methods.

Finally, on the Swift side of things, I added three methods for Realm:

I don't think it is possible though to move these methods into a separate module since Clang modules only support C/Objc...

Merely using types declared in its headers doesn't result in it being pulled in. Things don't work quite so well for Swift. Realm APIs mentioning `CLLocationCoordinate2D` doesn't result in CoreLocation.framework being pulled in directly, but it does result in CoreLocation's Swift overlay, `libswiftCoreLocation.dylib`, being pulled in, which in turn pulls in CoreLocation.framework.

It would be easy to declare our own coordinate type instead. The downside is that those users that choose to use our location-based APIs will have to convert between types when doing so. It's probably worth it to avoid pulling in CoreLocation unnecessarily for all clients using Swift.

Yeah, you are very right. I way I am able to grasp the Realm file(s) is to recursively find all of `.realm` files extension and open them all. It was kind of blind-fully because I don't have any info about how Realm Browser is opening the file or what file(s) the Browser is(are) actively opening. 

It works well and effectively in my use case (I have 2 apps in my Simulator with 2 default Realm files in 2 folders), but it seems like it might be not the case for you. :scream: One thing top of my mind right now is to focus just only on `default.realm` file, but the drawback is that plugin cannot be able to handle custom name.

Instead of doubling up on the logic for checking if multiple files are being passed, it might be better to ensure that the Realm Plugin is passing multiple Realm files to Realm Browser via the `openFiles:` delegate method.

2157,2015-07-06 18:57:19,"@segiddins thanks for the reply and the suggestion. I've checked my code for remaining references over and over but I just can't seem to find anything. I'm doing the bugged realm operations within a AWSTask `continueWithBlock:^id(AWSTask *task)` call, could that possibly be an issue?

If I were to migrate in the manner you described, what would happen in terms of schema version and migration when a new user logs in and I create a new realm? Would their realm automatically be updated to the post-migration version?
",ezwu,segiddins
2157,2015-07-06 20:35:24,"@segiddins Thanks immensely for your help. The queue issue doesn't seem to be the cause after some testing, since my other calls to realm occur on a background thread as well and don't cause me any problems.
I think what might be happening is that I'm potentially holding onto a reference of the object I am adding to the realm. Would that RLMObject's reference to the realm instance cause the realm to fail to deallocate? If that's the case, I think that that might be the reason for my issue.

I've tested two different ways of writing the necessary object to realm, the first being the original bugged way which is to call `[realm addObject:]` using my local reference to the object. The second way is to first pull from the online database Amazon dynamoDB, where the object is stored and then to add it to realm using the reference dynamoDB gives me, and that way doesn't cause the migration code to throw an exception.

As for your suggestion, could I just ask you to clarify how schema versions work? Specifically, my migration code sets, for specific objects, a new property that didn't exist on the old version to some default value. So if I were to open a new realm and write these objects with the new property already set to some other value into it, would the schema automatically update to reflect the fact that this property now exists or would it be some default value like 0 that would trigger the migration code to overwrite the value?

2150,2015-07-02 10:42:50,"@mrackwitz , thanks for your answer.

Sometimes, (and perhaps I'm not the only one) I need some further data processing when I retrieve records from realm. Manipulating data before presenting it to the view (like joining with other data, sorting, etc) gives additional flexibility. Don't get me wrong I love realm, but I always felt constrained but little things like inability to handle data easily since end up with custom data types like `Results` and `List`. Ok, here's my example:

I got a table containing bus stops (`List<Stop>`) Each stop has coordinates (latitude and longitude). Before Displaying the data to the view I grab it (and all associated relations), see where the user is currently positioned and enumerating through each item, measuring its distance to the user and putting the ones  within 100m in an empty `List<Stop>`. Say, now I want to sort this List by distance... or process it further, removing some items based on on some other changing conditions. I do not mind, but since `List` isn't a standard type, handling it can be a challenge if you see what I mean.

Reading other issues here I see people are starting to come up with `Extension`s for List and Result types, making some ""post-query"" operations easier.

Just thinking it might be good for me to create (dynamically ) new properties (timestamps) at run time (i need a timestamp for each property in a class).

2021,2015-06-12 19:12:51,"@segiddins - I finally figured it out. It turns out that the issue is [here](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/b51bbf47f508b7815a26c824cd0039824493ea07/Realm/RLMSchema.mm#L86). Workflow links against a lot of frameworks, and `objc_copyClassList` initializes every single class into structures in the runtime. Normally this process is lazy. For a sense of scale, in a sample app that links against every single framework, `objc_copyClassList` causes 7 MB of memory to be used, and the penalty in Workflow is 5 MB. This is roughly a third of the memory available to Notification Center widgets.

I hardcoded a list of `RLMObject` subclasses into `Realm.framework` and the issue is fixed. Do you think you could provide an alternate way of registering `RLMObject` subclasses, perhaps like this:

2016,2015-05-27 22:08:46,"Hi @tgoyne, thanks for your reply.

Well, since I'm downloading over 132 files, saving them when the app opens for the first time adds another 2 minute loading time until all the files are downloaded & created. Instead what I'm doing is getting the files as NSData and saving them in the default realm, then when I need them, I generate only those that I need on the fly in the temp directory.

According to your suggestion, I'm thinking that the way to go is instead of using the default realm (`RLMRealm.defaultRealm()`), create a new realm file in the Caches directory and save the data there. Then probably Apple won't consider this as an issue since that directory is not backed up.

Since I found the documentation about creating new realm files a bit light, can you suggest me where would be the best place to create the new realm file and a few code lines how the new file is created. If you have a link to any example it would be even better.

I'm not sure how to build the project without linking all the classes, that are used in the tests to the test target.

Can you enlighten me as to why this is necessary or how I can achieve not having to link application classes against my test target?

One thing that came to mind, that might be of relevance: I'm using Quick/Nimble as testing framework which encapsulates test descriptions in closures. I think it's not executing them on a background thread, but it certainly seems to queue the test execution on the main thread. Could it be, that this leads to race conditions of some sort?

1965,2015-05-26 19:38:00,"There are a few reasons why we're hesitant to make RLMRealm subclass-able and we should really share those with you.

One of them is that there are many parts of the codebase that assume that `RLMRealm` is just a single class, and not a subclass. [RLMRealm caching](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/v0.92.4/Realm/RLMRealmUtil.mm#L29-L58) to name just one example.

Also, to support subclassing RLMRealm, we'd need to write tests to make sure that in whatever arbitrary way users subclass and override functionality, the database file should never become corrupted, or other internal state should be resilient to such modifications. This is very difficult to do in a general sense.

Not to mention the additional support load of users trying to subclass RLMRealm and inevitably running into corner cases. We have our hands more than full already with even just supporting users who use Realm's public API, and we have to be quite careful about making any changes that would increase that support load and take time away from us fixing bugs and writing new features.

Finally, to echo what @segiddins has said here, we're very happy to work with you to improve Realm for everyone, including reviewing your work to add fine grain notifications and custom object validation (something that's useful to _all_ users of Realm). If that's not appropriate for these changes, then I'd encourage you to find ways other than subclassing, like composition, to achieve your goals.

1965,2015-05-26 19:45:08,"@jpsim I understand your reluctance to make any changes. As of now, I'll remain on my branch and rebase it with every release until it breaks.

I would be happy to share my work with object validation and notifications for someone to have a look at, but it requires a little bit more work on my end first (as I make some assumptions about the objects and primary keys). Ideally I should split this into two separate pull requests too.

As soon as I have had the time to make my code a little bit more generic, I'll make a new issue and share it with the rest of the community. I will try to get around to doing it this week.

In fact, I don't think it's necessary to support kvo for multilevel keypaths at all, and would rather see us only support observing of persisted properties on RLMObjects. This would obviate the need to hold onto accessors internally for multi-level keypaths and I imagine would simplify other aspects of the implementation.

In general I would rather see progress towards supporting changeset notifications which is the overwhelming top requested features rather than perfecting multilevel keypath kvo which no users if any have asked for afaik.

1921,2015-05-12 22:19:24,"Thanks @timanglade, I'll certainly publish an extension if I end up going this route ;) I'm still looking into options at the moment.

The simplicity of the realm API just seems like a perfect fit with the simplicity of react native. I can't imagine many react devs wanting to use CoreData. And at the moment that's not even an option, so a realm extension could bypass that problem altogether and pick up a ton of traction in the react community.

I know it's early to think about supporting react native, but bridging just the realm write and query apis would get most devs 80% of what they need. 

The biggest question would probably be how to handle models and migrations. There seems to be a lot of syntactic sugar surrounding those and I haven't found much documentation about how they work behind the scenes and could be exposed outside of xcode. Maybe that's the deal breaker.

Regarding initialization - I should have been more specific, I meant support for a custom _designated_ init rather than for a _convenience_ init.
Is this still being worked on?

This is important because in Swift convenience initializers can't be called by subclasses' initializers.
This makes subclassing a stored Realm object and calling its super.init(...) infeasible (e.g. Vehicle: Object, Bicycle: Vehicle).

I don't know how the Realm implementation works, but it seems that the problem can be solved on Realm's end by marking all initializers besides the empty init() as convenience initializers.

If the underlying 'problematic' initializers are written in Obj-C, this may be of help:

> For consistency and simplicity, Objective-C factory methods get mapped as convenience initializers in Swift. This mapping allows them to be used with the same concise, clear syntax as initializers.

Any idea regarding the timeline for implementing this? Is it being actively worked on yet?

I've actually come up with a hack around this that you guys might also find useful in allowing designated initializes (including overriding `init()` ).

It compiles fine but I haven't been able to test it yet, since I need to have objects of type `RLMRealm`, `RLMObjectSchema`, and `RLMSchema`.

Any idea how to get this work with RealmSwift?

I've tried simply having `import Realm` / `import Realm.Private` but while this compiles fine, it crashes during runtime with `dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/Realm.framework/Realm`.

I've also tried to directly add the compiled `Realm` framework onto the project the same way I added the `RealmSwift` framework (I'm using Carthage) but I got tons of errors due to ambiguity in which kind of a class to use (the `Realm` version or the `RealmSwift` version).

Any pointers would be much appreciated.

1849,2016-09-15 03:08:45,"@jpsim this is an old thread, but still relevant to me now.

Given the following file:



I get errors at line `super.init()` that `testProperty` is not properly initialized yet, which makes sense. Typically in this case I would just make `init(testProperty:)` a designated initializer, but because I'm required to implement an `init()` with no arguments if I want and custom initializer, I'm unsure how to properly initialize my stored properties with values from the caller of the init.

In this case something like a `func configure(testProperty:)` also doesn't work, as I get an error that `TestObject has no initializers` because no initializer is setting `testProperty`'s value.

Does this mean I'm not allowed to have stored properties without default values in an `Object` subclass? I don't want to make every stored property optional, should I simply set dummy values like `dynamic var testProperty: String = """"`? This feels kinda gross and un-swifty

Looking at all the crashes (we've gotten about 13k crashes now from about 4k users with about 25 different stack traces), it would seem that there is in fact some similarity between them. Most of them include trying to write an object into Realm that previously contained an indexed property (this property is no longer indexed, but is still present in the RLMObject subclass), so there might be a link there. We have not been able to reproduce these issues in piloting or testing, so I imagine it's plausible that this occurs for users that have had their database indexes previously corrupted by the aforementioned issue.

That sounds like a good plan, I'm thinking of the three states you mentioned as such:

### Delete Never

This is current behavior and should probably continue to be the default.  Don't override `cascadeProperties` and the objects are not deleted.

### Delete If Last Linked

If you override `cascadeProperties` this is the default cascade implementation.  This seems like it would be the most commonly desired use case.

### Delete Always

I also can't think of a good scenario for this, so I think this would need to be specified some how.  I haven't thought through how this should go from an api standpoint yet.  Might be considered just `delete` as opposed to `cascade`.

### Additions

I started sketching out the delete if last linked code because that seemed like the next logical step.  It currently covers finding whether or not other objects share the same `parent -> child` relationship, but it doesn't cover external links to the cascade property.  ie:



If I deleted `a` in the above example with `one` marked cascade, it would notice that `aPrime` still has a link and would not delete it.  However, it would not notice the link to `b`. Do you have a suggestion about how to find additional link objects within realm?  If not, it might require some sort of user facing api to mark alternative links.

Thanks for taking a look at some of this, I'm looking forward to any input!

1756,2015-04-14 22:22:08,"Thanks @jpsim , yes, thats what i was referring to, and actually the fine-grain solution would be a great solution.

Either way, I can give you an example to what i had in mind:
It's basically referring to a number of operations i perform in a transaction; If for example i'm performing a Login process to a user, and in that process I am saving a User object and another different object (let's say for argument sake) a Favorites Object. 
This whole login process can be tagged as ""Login_process_completed"" (string).

The LoginViewController (or other classes for that matter) can register to a notification block, and check the tag/name that is passed. if it is equals to ""Login_process_completed"", than i can continue with what i want.

I'm assuming the fine-grain solution can solve this problem as well, althuogh if i understand correctly i would have to ""register"" to a notification block for User object and for Favorites Object, and handle them separately. (or will they be passed as an array inside the same block?)

Because by default OSX's file-system is case-insensitive and by that changeset, we loose the separation of the directories for the headers of realm-core and realm-cocoa, we had before. I'm not aware of any direct issues with that, but it could have potentially unexpected side-effects.

I expect that i run into that:

_On the other hand, an Objective-C catch clause taking a dynamically typed exception object (@catch(id exception)) can catch any Objective-C exception, but cannot catch any C++ exceptions. So, for interoperability, use @catch(...) to catch every exception and @throw; to rethrow caught exceptions. In 32-bit, @catch(...) has the same effect as @catch(id exception)._

If i understand the last sentence correctly its not possible to handle C++ exceptions in Objective-C on 32bit platforms.

For the `CompletedWorkout` model, I'm pretty confused about how to hold the weight lifted and completed sets/reps for each exercise contained within `workout`. I have it set up above to just use arrays to hold that data, but I don't think it's the best way of doing it since they're not linked to an `Exercise` object. Any thoughts on how to clean this up? 

Second question: Exercises that have the same names like ""Squat"" can have a different number of reps and sets from each other, e.g. some workout routines have 3 sets of 5 reps and some have 5 sets of 5 reps. Since each Exercise will need to be unique in that regard, should I add a primary key to it? I might be overthinking all of this...

1584,2015-04-04 18:00:22,"A few comments:

`deleteBeforeOpening` and `deleteIfMigrationNeeded` are probably coming from the Java API. We havn't yet discussed whether they should be included or not. They are just part of my initial brainstorming. I can see why `deleteBeforeOpening` could be replaced with in-memory Realms, we just havn't implemented that yet in Java. 

`deleteIfMigrationNeeded` is a lot better and shorter for a lot of use cases where you don't want to bother with migrations. Forcing people to add a migration block and then call a method for this functionality doesn't seem very easy to me.

With regard to code length, I had the same thoughts as @segiddins about the brevity of unit tests. One just has to remember that unit tests are completely different beast than actually app code. In app code you would either set a default configuration or point to a global variabel holding the configuration, as you have very few Realm configurations there, but they are used repeatedly.

Unit tests might have a lot of different configurations, and I found it a lot easier to either setup a default configuration in the unit test setup method or use a Factory class with almost the same API as the old constructors.

1584,2015-05-05 18:04:20,"We just had a quick chat (@tgoyne @segiddins @bdash and I) and determined that to avoid multi-process race conditions, we should add a `deleteIfMigrationNeeded` to RLMConfiguration. /fyi @cmelchior

1584,2015-05-19 07:59:28,"@segiddins @jpsim @bdash  How do you plan to support schemaVersion/MigrationBlock?

Currently on the Java side we have two separate methods for this:
- `RealmConfiguration.schemaVersion(42)`
- `RealmConfiguration.migration(new MyCustomMigration())`

It might make sense to combine these as having a version above 0 makes very little sense without a migration block at the same time. Something along the lines of
- `RealmConfiguration.schemaVersion(42, new MyMigrationBlock())`

Counter to that is `deleteIfMigrationNeeded` in which case having a migration block doesn't make much sense.

Our current behaviour is this: 

1) If only schemaVersion is set we make a no-op migration behind the scenes that try to upgrade the version number. Schema is validated afterwards and throw an exception if there is mismatch.

2) If newSchemaVersion > currentSchemaVersion and a migration block is set. This migration will be called when first opening the Realm. We also have a method on the Realm for manually triggering this migration. Useful if you want to upgrade on a background thread: `Realm.migrateRealm(RealmConfiguration)`

3) Setting a migration block without a schemaVersion is a no-op, ie. migration code is never called. We might want to log a warning or throw an exception for this.

4) Setting a newSchemaVersion < currentSchemaVersion will throw an exception when opening the Realm.

5) Setting newSchemaVersion == currentSchemaVersion and a schema mismatch is detected will throw an exception when opening the Realm.

1525,2015-02-24 23:58:19,"@segiddins Thanks for following up on this. I actually solved the problem. I'm still new to Realm so I was using it improperly. I am basically using realm to cache objects from our API so all of this data ephemeral. My algorithm was destroying the item and rebuilding a new one from the cache before I deleted the child photo objects. So the child objects connected to the item persisted but the local item did not have references to them in its child array. Ah the joys of cache management...

1471,2015-02-09 04:50:48,"@segiddins - Thanks for getting back to me, I'm enjoying the library so far!

 I posted my current version of the project to a repo <a href=""https://github.com/LoganWright/ShowTracker"">here</a>.

If you pull it, I marked my current changes to the Realm library with the tag `//: LoganWright` so you can do a project search to see what I did.

I believe the underlying problem is in `JSONMapping`, and the way it loads objects from JSON.  This causes the `property->_objectClassName` to be nil during introspection and it cascades into more problems throughout the process because it's never properly set.

There shouldn't be a problem from what I can see, and I'm stuck trying to get the two to play nicely.  The show tracker app is really a means to an end, I'm more interested in building a layer that meshes my mapping, w/ Alamofire and Realm to make easy Rest consumption and persistence.  The show tracker is just a means to this.  

If you have any suggestions I can make to my mapping class to help it play nicely, I'd love to get some of these issues figured out, or build a good workaround.

### Modeling:

All of my realm modeling is in `TVRageNetworking.swift`.  (Some of it looks strange, it's a very old api, so it has a lot of edge cases)

### Mapping:

You can see my mapping process in `JSONMapping.swift`.  My first root class is `LGCodable` which subclasses `RLMObject`.

### Reproduce:

If you remove my changes here:



If you remove these changes, you'll see the base problem which is that the objectClassName is still nil at this point, which results in an exception throw.

Since when I do that, I get something like ""Realm is accessed from the wrong thread"". 
Do you mean that in order to do that, I just need to call <code>RLMRealm.defaultRealm()</code> before every read or write, instead of storing the <code>RLMRealm</code> into a property?

1322,2015-01-14 05:54:40,"Thanks @jpsim that seems to have worked. Here's what I get as my println for the description



It's very strange why such an odd approach has to be taken to get it to work. But anyways, I got to another part in the code where that list of trucks is passed around. And now I want to actually use the keywords on one of those RTruck objects and display each of them on screen. So, there are two strange things that happen here. The first being the following line of code,



If you give the join method an instance of myRLMArrayInstance it says it does not conform to the SequenceProtocol. Which is not correct because I know it does conform to that protocol in the RLMSupport.swift file. So to get around that, I figured I would loop through the items in my RLMArray instance and add them to my own array and do the join that way. Probably not the best approach but I just wanted to get it working first.



So I printed out the truck that came from the method we worked on in my previous comments. It prints out great! except for the keywords part. Here is an example of this println `println(truck.description)`



As you can see, the keywords RLMArray is empty. I'm not sure where these 3 RStrings went. If they just aren't printing out thats fine. However, sometimes the following println, (the one starting with `tdo -`) crashes the app because `truck.keywords` is nil. In the debugger it says the backing array for the RLMArray is nil. Very strange behavior. So if I take out that println that sometimes crashes, it `never` enters the for loop. Perhaps I need to do some more casting here? Either way, I can't really figure it out. I've tried a lot so far. Any pointers?

I then opened up `TruckMuncher.xcworkspace` and deleted the reference to Properties.plist to get it to compile for now. Then I clicked the Run button to launch the app. When the app opens in the simulator it asks for permission to access your location. I clicked `Allow`. Then while the simulator is running, in the menu/status bar I clicked `Debug`->`Location`->`Apple`. Then the important step, `I had to run the application again in Xcode`. Then my logs start by showing what you saw, and then multiple iterations of this:



I was able to reproduce what you were seeing (the absence of the logs that showed the issue) when the simulator did not have a location set and I did not run the app for the second time after setting a location.

I do have one question though. Let's take the situation where you make a network request, construct one of my RTruck objects, use the `createOrUpdate` method and it stores it perfect. Now that truck is stored and has a primary key with the `id`. What if the app is closed and later its opened again and data used to construct a brand new RTruck in memory was taken from the network and then passed to `createOrUpdate`? Even if its a brand new truck in memory, I can't use `createOrUpdate`?

1272,2014-12-30 11:14:40,"I've only taken a brief glance at this - my main concern would be the complexity and overhead required to use the proposed apis. Requiring a user to define a new class every time they need a transformation seems excessive for most use cases.

@jpsim was not around for some of the design discussions we have had regarding this feature set. Some of more important design goals/requirements we have discussed include:
- the ability to specify mapping/transformations using literals - this makes it much easier to specify mappings, especially for simpler use cases
- a non-intrusive design which doesn't require knowledge of the mapping system internally - because Realm objects can be created from any kvc objects it isn't necessary to have special logic in the object create code to apply transforms.
- the ability to selectively apply transformations on a per-object basis is pretty important - with the proposed apis transformations are always applied.

I'll try to look at this in depth later in the week to see if we can tweak the proposed apis to meet these and some of our other design goals.
",alazier,jpsim
1272,2014-12-31 13:15:59,"@alazier I totally agree, it does add a certain amount of overhead, something I debated while deciding between a couple solutions. My use case tends to be integrating with a new data source. Something I don't do often after initial dev, and when I do, I expect there to be some mapping work involved. I'm sure you guys have more use cases you're hearing from customers, so obviously open to all feedback.

I felt the protocol was a good mix of flexibility while aligning to the defined set of steps / behaviors involved with mapping. To help minimize some of the work, the thought was that users could define translation classes as part of the `RLMObject` subclass itself, or perhaps grouped in separate files - e.g. `SourceOneAPITranslations.h/m` and `SourceTwoAPITranslations.h/m`. After implementing the protocol approach in my project, I do need to revisit making some methods `@optional` if we move forward with it.

Yes, as the API stands now, you can have one translation that will always be applied if specified. My plan was to work through the entire problem in two steps:
1. finalize the approach to mapping / transformation, then
2. update to solve the per-instance requirement, which depends on the solution from step 1

I've started sketching out what that looks like. I think it's as straightforward as another initializer - `initWithTranslation:andObject:`. Translation being what we settle on in this first step. This will require an update to the `RLMValidatedDictionaryForObjectSchema` function to pass the instance, something I wanted to discuss with you guys first.

That said, would it be beneficial for me to polish one of the other approaches I debated and submit a separate PR for comparison? It's more similar to the previous mapping-only PR.
",nathanhjones,alazier
1272,2014-12-31 18:09:21,"There are two overarching design principles I am hoping to seewith these apis:

1 - The mapping apis should be on a fundamental level decoupled from the other Realm apis. We don't want to bake in logic to apply transforms in the validation methods as this approach doesn't scale for nested objects - even if we had a creation method which took a translation and an object, users would also need to supply transforms for all nested child objects and we would have to pass the transforms throughout the object creation pipeline which isn't practical.

The simplest (and most common) approach to decouple these apis is to any mapping before using any Realm apis at all. This has the benefit of being completely decoupled, with the downside of having duplicate/copy the entire object tree before insertion. Another approach which avoids the need to copy data is to have an wrapper object which applies transforms when accessing object properties. The wrapper object can then be passed to Realm when creating objects and can be applied on demand. Accessing nested object properties simply wrap these objects on access so this approach should scale and perform well. My hope was is the apis we end up with support both models, standalone value transformation and object wrapping.

2 - The apis should be declarative whenever possible. In general this makes apis a lot easier to use, and the code a lot easier to read. I don't see why we can't have a single initialization for a mapper which takes a dictionary that maps keys to either a source keypath, a transformation block, or any other supported mapping. 

In general, I was imaging the example in this pr looking something like:



which functionally is very similar to what you have proposed, but allows you to specify a mapping at runtime using a single initializer which I think is much more user friendly.

There are still some issues that need to be worked out, mostly that mapper/transformation creation also may need to take an objectSchema and the entire schema being operated on to support nested objects properly. It's possible to infer this information from object being transformed, so this may not be needed in the end - in any case we need to give this some more thought to work through the details.

Hopefully this will give you better sense of what I am hoping for from these apis. I've discussed some of this at various times with @tgoyne and @jpsim but I don't think we ever reached consensus on what we planned to build. If they agree with this overall design I think we can move forward with nailing down the api details pretty quickly.
",alazier,jpsim
1272,2015-01-04 19:16:42,"After digging into `RLMObject` initialization behind the scenes a bit, I've got a better understanding and agree that this over complicated and won't scale. My goal was to minimize changes to existing API and the solution suffered for that.

Yes, mapping / transformation should be decoupled from the validation code. I ran some more complex examples through this PR as-is and there are cases where it breaks down given that validation appears to happen when objects are added to a realm as well.

That said, I agree with @jpsim that mapping and transformation should be separate. I like the idea of an `RLMMapping` class that can be passed on initialization. We could then add a couple additional functions to be called in this order:
1. Convert inbound keys to expected keys - `RLMMappedValuesForObjectSchema(id value, NSDictionary *mapping, RLMObjectSchema *objectSchema)`
2. Transform values to correct type / value - `RLMTransformedValuesForObjectSchema(id value, NSDictionary *transforms, RLMObjectSchema *objectSchema)`
3. Run existing validation check `RLMValidatedDictionaryForObjectSchema(id value, RLMObjectSchema *objectSchema, RLMSchema *schema, bool allowMissing)`

@jpsim - I agree, checking for `_realmMapping` is obscure. Feels odd to manipulate an inbound API response before being able to use it. 

Not thrilled with a bunch of new methods, but I think 3 is reasonable given the functionality added. If a dev wants to specify a mapping, other than default (see below), they use the more verbose constructor. The existing methods would just call the new methods passing `nil`, so shouldn't be much overhead.

**Here are a couple more questions:**
1. Do we still provide API for specifying a default `RLMMapping` object? Personally, I like it and I think it will simplify most of the use cases. I know my use cases have very few scenarios where I need more than one mapper, allowing me to use `initWithObject:` vs a more verbose method.
2. What are your thoughts on the block transformation parameters? I could see cases where receiving all values is beneficial:
   - id(^)(id attribute) - e.g. the single mapped value like '123'
   - id(^)(id attributes) - e.g. the `NSDictionary` of all attributes

1243,2014-12-18 18:33:33,"@timanglade I don't think you fully understand why people keep hitting the file size issue. It isn't an issue of compaction or due to the size of allocations. Its due to the fact that we often times hold onto sparsely populated blocks of data unnecessarily. The real solution is to not hold onto unneeded blocks which is the actual problem here, and none of the workarounds you suggest actually solve this issue and have the following issues:
- Users can already compact their db using writeCopyToPath. The big problem with any of this type of solution is that users don't know they need to call this method (because if everything else worked they shouldn't have to), and there is a good possibility that calling a compaction method could induce noticeable lag in apps.
- Auto-compacting after deletes doesn't make any sense. You don't need to delete any objects to trigger the space wastage - you only need to create object in many write transactions while there is another existing read transaction. What might make sense is auto-compacting after a large number of write transactions resulting into unreferenced blocks. The only way I could see this working is if compaction and writes in general happened in the background to prevent blocking a user's app.
- Changing the allocation size isn't going to fix anything. It could prevent a few users from hitting the limit, but at that point they still have the issue of wasting a huge amount of disk space. One thing we could change is the branching factor in core which will slow the rate that space is wasted, but that is a separate issue entirely.

1160,2014-11-29 05:51:48,"Hi @jpsim, Thanks for your response, and for considering this optimization. One thing I noticed in your reference `UITableViewController` implementation is that, `self.array` is assigned to the result of the `[[DemoObject allObjects] sortedResultsUsingProperty:@""date"" ascending:YES]` query every time a notification is posted. Wouldn't this mean that the query is executed every time we receive a notification?
I ask because, from my understanding of how `RLMResults` works, it should already have the changes made to the underlying Realm when a notification is posted, which would mean that calling `reloadData` on the `tableView` is all that would be needed.

The reference implementation was actually one of the first things I saw, and initially did exactly as it demonstrates, but later, as my query results got larger and the query itself slower (and started blocking the UI), I changed my implementation to only do the query once, right before setting realm notification block in my `viewDidLoad`, and `-[RLMRealm addNotificationBlock:]` only does `[weakSelf.tableView reloadData]`. So, yes, I'm assigning self.array to the result of the query, but unlike the reference implementation, I'm only doing that once. Could that explain why Realm needs to do a count query everytime I reload my tableView after receiving a notification?
",kunalsood,jpsim
1160,2015-01-08 01:40:09,"@segiddins that optimization was made before this issue was opened. Calling `sortedResultsUsingProperty` requires a tableView to exist which is expensive. Only calling `count` doesn't require tableView construction and is usually much faster. It seems that @kunalsood understands this based on his original post (that calling count alone on RLMResults is much faster than calling count on a sorted RLMResults).

I think what is being asking for here is to do tableView creation lazily when calling `sortedResultsUsingProperty`. This is possible but would require a bit refactoring and storing the sort state both in the binding and in core which is something that would be good to avoid.

1156,2014-12-01 17:15:49,"I think the use-case is 90% the latter (we just want to say “call this method if we tell you that it fixes the problem you're reporting”), but we want to be able to pepper it in the right sample apps and code samples. In either case, our answer shouldn’t invite more questions such as “wait why do I never call beginReadTransaction?” or “what’s a read transaction in Realm”? i.e. we should either stick with completely hiding read transactions from Realm, or expose them fully, but just having one method allude to it indirectly is absolutely not the right way to go, from a user standpoint.
- Assuming we want to keep hiding the concept of a read transaction to the user, I think `close` is the best bet. It’s innocuous enough and will coincide with what we use on the Java side. If you really really dislike `close`, we could use `detach`, `sleep`, `drift`, or any other word you can think of that does not invite a direct symmetry. Functionally that method should have the same visibility & impact in our API than `refresh` or the properties `path` and `schema` i.e. something useful & easy to remember for advanced users but that shouldn’t trouble or pique the interest of a novice user.
- If you want to expose read transactions to the user (e.g. if we think this method should totally pique the interest of a novice users) let’s close this PR and design a proper API.

Seems like the best place to do this would be in `RLMProperty`, inside of `setTypeFromRawType`, where the `RLMPropertyTypeArray` case is handled. Instead of throwing an exception when `RLMIsObjectSubclass` returns false, we instead check the `_objectClassName` against a white list of class names (Just `NSString`,and `NSNumber` would be a good start) and then do what Realm would usually do with an `RLMObject` the user would provide as the inner class of the array.

This throws an error without a initialiser called `init()`. So then you create a simple initialiser, like this:



Of course you get a compile error here, because you are calling `super.init()` before the property `someRelation` is set. So should I set the `someRelation` property just to `MyOtherClass()`?



Finally you end up with a bunch of initialisers (`override init()`, `override init!(objectSchema schema: RLMObjectSchema!)` and your custom initialiser).  And this leads to all kinds of bugs, like objects being created with default values.

I created an example:



Now, what should be the appropriate way to init a DemoObject2, init a DemoObject1 and commit them to the database?

I tried:



But this results in 2 DemoObject2 objects being stored, one with a `name` and the other without. The DemoObject1 is stored in the database, but the `someObject` property is always pointing to a record without the `name` value set.

I tried splitting it up in multiple transactions, but this ends in the same problem. (This might even be a separate thread, sorry about that).

Very bad idea. The check is presumably there for a reason. I'm guessing that sometimes a property fetch will fail and the access to the realm to back fill that thread is going to fail.

It's actually alerting you to a bug you have which if left would be much more difficult to find even if it wouldn't happen every time.

The solution is the same for you as it was for me: in your SAX parse, store the primary key of the object you are currently building and fetch it from Realm at the start of every operation. Like @tgoyne said, it's pretty fast (and not a lot of extra code).

Sounds like what works is the alternative which means specify access control on classes and import them and do not include in test target.

983,2014-10-07 18:11:27,"Hi @dismory, as of `0.86.0`, adding an object to a Realm will also add all its links. This is done because a Realm object cannot have a relationship to an object outside that Realm.

In previous versions of Realm, your code may have ran without exception, but would have potentially left one of these objects in an undefined state, under certain circumstances.

I can see the need to throw an exception when adding an object to two different Realms, but is there a reason why adding it to the same realm multiple times couldn't be a no-op? /cc @tgoyne @alazier

Or your own RealmEnumValueConvertible in case the user already implemented CustomStringConvertible and wants to differ the persisted value from it (rare, but could be valid in certain cases).

PS: I find the deltas between the model objects and what's needed to persist them in Realm is really blowing up our domain - I think it would be a great goal for the team to try to prioritize minimizing these differences for the overall adoption/practicality of the framework.

- Data to be synced across multiple clients (iOS, Android, Web, WP7 etc)
- Roles/permissions for objects
- Sever code (similar to Parse's cloud code utility) in order to define validation rules or execute code which has to the ability to bypasses roles/permissions

The above could be accomplished by a paid server hosting service by Realm (BAAS?) or an option to deploy a server library to your own server (similar to what Couchbase does).

Another solution could be to create multiple REST API examples of how Realm can be used, eg. todo list with relationships being synced or a social networking app based off Parse (or another BAAS/REST API).

Interesting reading re: CRDTs. IMO, I don't think many app developers would want to opt for CmRDTs because of all the connection-based stuff. (A user might not open an app for a month or more and still expect it to work).

Dan Grover's sync presentation from '09 has been invaluable to me for getting my head around sync. See here (although this is only one of many possible CRDTs AFAICT): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5035132/how-to-sync-iphone-core-data-with-web-server-and-then-push-to-other-devices/5164878#5164878 (the link is broken, but someone has found it again on the waybackmachine).

> If you're saying that there's a period of time after being disconnected that a local database will stop working, I think there's no theoretical limit on a partition time disconnected (though there may be practical ones) -- meaning that if an app becomes disconnected, because CRDT guarantees local availability by using eventual consistency rather than strong consistency, all writes and reads to the local database are guaranteed to succeed... and when the app reconnects the replica will become consistent with all other replicas assuming that the other replicas (i.e. users on other phones) commutative state changes have been stored for when the replica comes back online (this requires a queue). So an app's local database is ALWAYS available for read/write no matter it's connected/disconnected/partial connected state.

I was referring to your previous para:

> The coordinator will also have to keep track of all the past changes so that when a client reconnects it can send the appropriate changes to the client. These could possibly be consolidated but a major problem is knowing how long to wait for a client to reconnect before declaring them lost. Otherwise, coordinators have to keep track of all past changes indefinitely. This is more or less the question of when to rebase. More recent changes could be cached for users that expect less latency as they are actively connected, whereas users transitioning out of offline mode might expect more latency as the coordinator gets all the past changes to update the client on and do merging.

As I understand it, this connection-based approach is required for CmRDT (not that I really understand what a CRDT is due to lack of concrete examples) because it replays diffs and, as you mentioned, changes need to be kept around indefinitely. I can't see this being a good solution for most mobile apps...

It would be nice to merge it since I spent some time making sure all kinds of row rearrangement work, including if you move for example rows 3, 8, and 10 to index 5. 

But it requires a change to the bindings, which might not be very useful in other cases. The thing is that because dynamic objects aren't really supported yet, I can't use any of the other array related methods (like insert etc). The move method works because it doesn't refer to objects, only their indices, so it never checks the object class.

Perhaps the best thing is to wait until dynamic objects work, then I can use the UI from this PR, add some functionality for inserting and drag-dropping from other windows, and use the dynamic functionality. 

All the same, even when we have a working dynamic interface, it would seem natural to use the move function when we are moving objects within an array, rather than removing and putting back in. So then we would need the binding change anyway.

It should be possible in principle, using reloadDataForRowIndexes:columnIndexes, but:
- This only makes sense for some kinds of edits (not deleting lots of object or array links, or other things that are not yet supported)
- The same object can be viewed in a table, an array and an object link, or even a query. It's very tedious to figure out what exactly to reload and not.
- Total reload is very fast, and since this is something that happens in response to a user event, speed is not that important - we won't have to do it many times a second.
- There seems to be a bug in this method, at least there was a few years ago, and I haven't been able to use it

It now also displays the app name (or rather, xcode project name) for files in the developer folder.

One could potentially want to show the app name for files in the simulator too, that should be possible using the same technique. It's pretty fast, it takes about 100 ms to do the initial query for all files matching *.xcodeproj - this is done at app launch, in the background, and then when the menu is used it takes 1 ms to lookup the app name for each menu item in the developer menu.

This PR contains three things:

*A quick fix for endlessly recursing tooltips. It seems to be a binding issue but a quick glance at the code indicates that recursion is protected against. Will investigate this.

*The column with row order index for arrays

*Ability to double click a column separator to resize it to fit the contents, as in excel or finder.

The latter two shouldn't really be in this pull request but ended up here by accident, because I didn't keep my master clean. They are however quite small and uncontroversial, and should be merged in sooner or later anyway. I removed stuff that was unnecessary.

854,2014-09-02 23:10:00,"Hi @icanzilb, thanks for filing this issue. We intend on adding JSON serialization and deserialization to Realm in the near future, but until that time, it's pretty easy to integrate Realm with JSONModel or Mantle.

An easy way to bridge `JSONModel` with Realm would be to add a category on `RLMObject` with a method called `initWithJSONModel:` that would iterate over the `JSONModel` properties and create an `NSDictionary` that was then passed on to `RLMObject`'s `initWithObject:`.

Something like:



You could even distribute this as a CocoaPod with `Realm` and `JSONModel` dependencies.

I don't think we'll be adding the ability to initialize a Realm object from a model object like this in the binding because it's not exactly optimal for performance or ease-of-use. I'll bring it up with other Realm developers and report back here.

Thank you for looking through it! I've taken care of all your comments now.

As to the generator, there are both object links and array links. Basically the generator looks at the schema of the classes it is initialised with and goes through them to create random values for each type, including links.

It tries to reuse objects that have already been added to the realm, so if you init it with @[@""Dog"", @""Person""] and person has an object or array link property of Dogs, it will link to the objects already created, instead of making new ones. It depends on the order of the classes though.

<code>dynamic var tag: String! //Won't work, crash with **\* Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'Unsupported predicate value type', reason: 'Object type any not supported' </code>

As soon as multiple realms are in use in the app, timing differences
may lead to different file layouts. There are two causes of wasted space:
Fragmentation and retained versions.

Fragmentation may occur and cause a file size which is significantly larger
than the contained data. For larger sizes the fragmentation usually is a
small problem.
But note, that in the context of our leaf sizes, both the files presented
here must
be considered small .. meaning that significant fragmentation may occur.

Retained versions hold data for realms which are older than the most recent.
As these versions are released they become free data, but the free areas can
only be taken into use by commits occurring _after_ the release.

Even though the application exits and the lock file is removed, different
file sizes may
still result, because the database is not ""compacted"" when the app exits.
When
the app exits, all retained versions are freed, BUT all the space they
consumed
will have been allocated in the file, scattered around in it, and as there
is no
compaction, the file does not shrink.

So filesize depends very much on the exact operation of the app. Especially
for
small sizes and applications which (at some point in their live) have many
retained versions.

Core limits the number of retained versions to 100 if I remember correctly.
If each of these versions hold changes to most of the data, each version
may take up as much space as the final version.

693,2014-07-28 18:14:09,"@alazier What do you mean by ""it alters the behavior""?. When the result property is an int, the compiler will create an implicit casting that is going to work the exact way the explicit casting is working.  Meaning that when the value on the db is a long, the property will ended up taking (v & 0xffffffff) before and after my fix. 

Having said that, I think changing objcType to 'l' seems like a simpler change and I'm +1. 

The problem with that though is that when running Swift in 32bits platforms, forcing ""Int"" to ""l"" is probably not the best solution. I'll try to poke around to see if I can think on a better way of fixing it and I'll create a new pull request soon.

2. Edit Xcode's build settings to copy the correct header depending on platform
3. At this point, neither header is imported, so the `#error` inside the headers won't get picked up
4. Edit `Realm.h` to conditionally `#import` the appropriate error header
5. If a user attempts to use the iOS framework in an OSX project, they will catch the same conditional import as 4 and won't get the correct error message

When `youtube_id` is nil, works correctly. 
When the `youtube_id` is not nil it shows this error.

We hear you, null support is a top priority for us. We're adding in null support type by type in Realm's core database engine. Strings are done, and progress on other types is advancing steadily. We'll expose that in the higher level language bindings as soon as it's ready.

In the meantime, it really shouldn't be necessary to completely move away from Realm for this limitation. Our current suggested workaround should be flexible enough to support any scenario: wrap properties that should be nullable in an RLMObject subclass:

# Realm Core Null v1 BETA

THIS IS A BETA RELEASE — USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. It might delete your data or cause other catastrophic events. Please report any bugs or issues on [Github](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues) and clearly mention you are using the “null beta”.

## Release Notes

**Realm Core Null v1 does not expose new features to you**. What it does is silently upgrade our file format to enable null support. This is a critical step for us to validate. Without confirmation from a number of beta-testers, we will not be able to release Realm Cocoa Null Betas, which will let you have null string properties (more types will follow).

**This core release is only compatible with Realm Cocoa 0.91.2 or later.**

You can find the core release that includes null support at https://static.realm.io/downloads/core/realm-core-null-v1.zip

## Instructions

### If you are building Realm from source
1. Build https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa from master (make sure you are using a version of realm-cocoa >= 0.91.2)
2. Replace the files under core-0.89.0 with those contained in this zip
3. Rebuild and use the resulting framework in your file

### If you are using Realm through CocoaPods
1. Make sure you are using Realm version 0.91.2 or later.
2. Replace the files under Pods/Realm/core with the contents of the core folder of this zip.

### If you are using the zip releases from our website

You will not be able to test null support at this time. We may release beta binaries with null support at a later date. In the meantime you can build an equivalent .framework from source using the instructions above.

## Help!

Please report any bugs or issues on [Github](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues) and clearly mention you are using the “null beta”.

628,2015-04-21 08:45:37,"@jpsim I tried to build static framework with null support, but the problem is that after adding new core `build.sh` script downloads old core.

It looks like the realm file gets into some kind of locked state and keeps growing larger and larger while I'm inspecting it. 
Started: 25KB
Reload same data (update or insert): 122KB
Keep loading page over and over (update or insert): 500KB
More (update or insert): 2MB
More: 12.6MB
More: 25.2MB
After 25.2MB it keeps climbing by itself (the app is not running) until it reached ~300MB (I deleted it at that point). I've attached some screenshots of the realm files I would download from the app bundle and inspect.

I'm importing the JSON into models (using an APIObject wrapped via CottonObject) in a background thread, each model has its own write transaction, and when the import is done I execute a completion block with the data on the main thread like this:

I also don't think we need to suffix all examples with the word 'Example'
as they are all in the examples directory. I also think we should add back
the workspace which has all of the examples and builds the framework
automatically as needed.

1. Merge conflicts were too large to continue merging master into this, so I applied the efforts of this branch to master and reopened this branch. This caused commit history to disappear.
2. I have not yet integrated the changes you made in a separate branch yesterday to re-add testing of objc models. I hope to do this later today.
3. I filed a radar ([rdar://17601747](http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5771227683618816)) for the issue stopping us from extending or subclassing ObjC classes from Swift within the same module. I also started a [Developer Forums conversation](https://devforums.apple.com/thread/235252?tstart=0) in hopes to find a work-around.

We all have to be patient with this progress as we are integrating a very immature language and toolset with a complex project.
",jpsim,alazier
487,2014-07-14 07:11:39,"READY FOR REVIEW: @astigsen @alazier @kneth @bmunkholm.

Current State:

Features:
- Supports all RLMPropertyTypes except Any
- +className and column names use demangled class name
- RLMArrays support Sequence-style enumeration (`for obj in array`)
- Xcode 5 project and tests continue to work with these changes
- Swift tests test both Swift and Objective-C models

Caveats:
- Properties other than String, NSData and NSDate require a default value in the model. This can be an empty (but typed) array for array properties.
- The previous caveat also implies that not all models defined in Objective-C can be used for object properties. Only Objective-C models with only implicit (i.e. primitives) or explicit default values can be used. However, any Objective-C model object can be used in a Swift array property.
- Array property accessors don't work until its parent object has been added to a realm.
- `Realm-Bridging-Header.h` is temporarily exposed as a public header. This is temporary and will be private again once rdar://17633863 is fixed.
- Does not leverage Swift generics and still uses RLM-prefix everywhere. This is coming in #549.

So overall, I think this is ready to live in master, with bug fixes coming as future PR's.

I also like the example, but I'm wondering if the shuffling of files is muddying the concepts being conveyed. Moving all the path generation and NSFileManager code to a separate method would help.

Mostly, I think we should embrace Objective-C's verbosity rather than work around it. For example `RLMPredicateGen` should be renamed to `RLMPredicateGenerator` and `OP_TYPE`/`OP_OPTIONS` should be removed.

Moreover, try-catch blocks should be replaced with `XCTAssertThrows` to go from 9 lines to 1-2.

The warning should probably output something like this instead:

of clue about where to get started. It's actually to try to help newcomers!
Once there are many files (and we are getting there now), it's nice to get
a little help understanding the structure. It's not to ""hide"" anything.
Separating them in two simple buckets (PublicClasses, InternalClasses) for
a start would be a help. Or whatever logical grouping that makes sense.
Whether this logical structure is reflected in the physical structure is
less interesting to me (except if it could help tooling for docs for
example).

We’ve been chatting here about not actually including any network logic in the library, but maybe just offering optional Categories that load up methods that rely on AFNetworking. That would wait until after launch. What do you think of this potential approach @kneth?

I think what we do need to have for launch are just JSON<=>Realm mapping functions. I see there is something to map a JSON object to a Realm object, but what about offering a way to do the reverse? Is that automatically handled by your method?

As @timanglade points out we need to have a mapping from `RLMObject` and `RLMArray` to JSON.  We do have `to_json` in the core but it's not what we wish as column names are not transformed. The `*ToURL` family was supposed to do the mapping based on the `RLMJSONSerialization` but we don't have a network layer, we probably just have a `stringValue:asJSON` method.

279,2014-05-09 22:41:48,"@timanglade The idea is to treat the RealmTools CLI, Plug-in, and/or OSX App as a standalone Application independent of the objc bindings. That's why I was thinking of having it in a separate repo. 

The Podfile approach sounds ok to me however it doesn't seem like linking to a local Podspec is the way to go unless we want to maintain the Podspec versions within the objc root. The Podfile in Realm*Examples and RealmTools will need to reference a remote Podspec in order for their Podfiles to specify a version to support. 

Secondly, if we are storing a static version of the core in the objc bindings and tools, we should be versioning those too. Since we most likely won't be using cocoapods with the core, I'm thinking of something along the lines of adding a suffix to communicate what version of core we're using (i.e. libtightdb-0.x.0.a).

Either way, I will keep the RealmTools project in this repo until we have:
1. A remote Podspec with versioning. 
2. A versioned static library for core.

This offers us a number of benefits:
- It allows us to only rely on the objective-c bindings.
- It allows us to give have a buildable project that we can share so that users can install an Xcode plugin via Alcatraz or Xcode.

@alazier for both conceptual and technical reasons, we can't move this functionality to table retrieval.

Conceptual: You might want some initial tables/data in your realm, you might want to create _many_ tables. It makes more sense to do this on the realm level than create many tables when getting a single one.

Technical: Performing write operations _after_ a realm has been created would require the realm to be ""reset"", i.e. fast-forwarded to the latest state. I'm sure @astigsen can come up with more reasons this would be difficult technically.

",timanglade,pauldardeau
119,2014-04-17 01:10:14,"@bmunkholm I will answer your questions both here an in a file (release_note.md or similar).

What's required otherwise in terms of build, setup documentation, download
of examples etc?
The crash reporter 'should' largely be invisible to app developers that make use of TightDB.  With the recent change from linking with libc++.dylib to libstdc++.6.dylib, this removed the requirement of having to explicitly link libstdc++.dylib.  The app should add ""-ObjC"" and ""-all_load"" to ""Other Linker Flags"" in Xcode build settings.  This is because the Apigee code uses categories fairly extensively.

How is crash reporting enabled/disabled?
By default, it's enabled with the changes that I made.  I modified ""TDBContext"" (and will need to do the same with ""TDBSmartContext"") class methods that retrieve the context to initialize the crash reporter.  The code is also surrounded by preprocessor macros that can be easily used to disable all of the crash reporting completely.  TDBContext changes calls into TDBCrashReportingAgentLauncher's ""startCrashReporter"" to do the heavy-lifting of initializing the crash reporter.  This code looks for a key named ""TDBDisableCrashReporting"" as a boolean property.  If this key is found in the app's Info.plist file and has a TRUE value, then it DISABLES the crash reporting (by never initializing it).  Having a value of FALSE, or not having the key at all, will cause the crash reporting to be enabled (as it is by default).

Access to server of logs?
The Apigee app identifiers (similar to credentials) can be found in the top (lines 29 & 30) of TDBCrashReportingAgentLauncher.mm (a new source file).

I would encourage you to go to https://apigee.com/appservices and click on the ""sign up"" (it's free, and they don't spam you too much).  When you sign up, it'll ask you to create an org name (""TightDB"" or ""Realm"") and an app.  In our case, we're not using the SDK in an ""app"", but in a framework, but the name really only has to make sense to you.  You can name the org name and app name whatever you like (Apigee doesn't really care).  Then you can change the hard-coded values in TDBCrashReportingAgentLauncher.mm to match the values that you set up in Apigee's portal.  Once you're set up with Apigee, you use that same url (above) to login to the Apigee portal.  Once inside the Apigee portal, look for the ""MONITORING"" section in the left-hand navigation bar of the portal.  Under that section, you'll see ""App Usage"" (high-level stats about sessions), ""Errors & Crashes"" (this is the part that's relevant for crash reporting!), and ""API Performance"" (network perf stats).

Paul, could you please describe the needed steps to completely integrate
this? (release_note.md update, technote describing this feature?)
I'll add all of this documentation to a file also.

? Can you please provide a test example? And describe how to get and use
the crash-report?
I made some changes to the Stocks demo app, so that it prompts the user whether to force a crash (to test out the crash reporting functionality) when you tap on the ""Chart"" button for a stock.

? How does the crash reporter work (high level)?
The Apigee code makes use of PLCrashReporter.  PLCrashReporter registers itself as an exception handler and gets called (since it registered itself as an exception handler) when a crash is happening. PLCrashReporter quickly and carefully gathers up information about the machine type, OS details, registers, and threads.  It writes all of this data out in a binary format to disk.  NO REPORTING OF THE CRASH HAS OCCURRED AT THIS POINT IN TIME.  The crash report is simply sitting in a file on the device (in the app's sandbox).  When the app is RESTARTED, the Apigee code looks for a crash report.  If it finds one, it reads it (deletes the file), reformats it as an ASCII report and transmits it to the Apigee portal.  After a certain number of minutes (as short as 2, as long as 15 or 20), the email address that was registered on the Apigee portal should receive a system generated email notifying them that a crash occurred (that they received a crash report). You can then go to the Apigee portal and find and view the crash report online.

? How much bigger does it make the lib?
Quite a bit bigger, even though I pared down the Apigee client SDK significantly.  Currently, the Tightdb.framework is 12.5 MB in size.  Adding in the Apigee library (that also contains the PLCrashReporter), the Tightdb.framework grows to 28.8 MB. I wouldn't be too concerned about it because the run-time footprint is pretty small.

? What else should we know?
The Apigee code doesn't even try to initialize PLCrashReporter if the app is running under control of Xcode. Why? Xcode interferes with crash detection.

The crash reports that get uploaded to Apigee are NOT SYMBOLICATED.  In order to symbolicate a crash report, you need to have the corresponding .dSYM that was generated when the app was built (the specific one, not just any one you might have lying around). Some crashes can be meaningfully deciphered even without being symbolicated, and others cannot.

We need to have the user documentation ready as well. Where should what be
written - very specifically?
- update of build flags.
- a usernote somewhere about this 'temporary feature', how they disable it
  and why it's good for them.

We don't want to publish the README you added as it is. It's an internal
note. But maybe we would want a userlevel note about this either in the
distribution or on the web. @Tim, maybe you can help out to figure out
where to put what documentation. I'm afraid users don't like this. We need
to ""sell"" this feature as a help to them.

66,2014-03-13 21:29:14,"Guys, as you know, I find the use of the `TDB` prefix as something of an abomination.

On the other hand, I understand that many of you guys like it. Tim has offered the following explanation of his point of view:

> The lack of namespacing in Objective-C clearly sucks, but I’m actually hugely in favor of prefixing with just “TDB”: it’s one of those things that make you look/feel really native to iOS and that is a huge thing we need to accomplish at this point. It’s also the rule of law as far as Apple is concerned. Additionally, it does not matter so much that someone else may be using “TDB”, as this will not create hard collisions in and of itself; we would have a real problem if there were already Objective-C classes called TDBTable (or TDBContext, etc.) in common usage, which summary searches on GitHub and Google indicates is not likely.

I understand this concern, but I would like to offer some additional thoughts that we might want to weigh in:
- Some will be angry with us, because we steel their prefix. Note the aggravated responses in http://cocoadev.com/ChooseYourOwnPrefix.
- Some will see it as anti-collaborative and dogmatic. I would.
- If we explain why we use `Tightdb` rather than an acronym, most developers will understand it, and appreciate it. We could even score extra points. See below for a concrete proposal of such an explanation.
- As long as the decision is appreciated by the experienced segment, other developers will agree.
- The use of acronyms is probably not ""the rule of law"". See for example http://cocoadev.com/ChooseYourOwnPrefix, and note how they explicitly point out that the use of an acronym is **not** mandatory.
- It is hell from a programmer when he is hit by name collisions.
- Look around you, and see how every other popular language out there has understood that name spaces are necessary.

Now, if by any chance I can convince you to stay on `Tightdb`, I propose that we add something like the following to our introductory text:

> Note that the TightDB framework uses `Tightdb` as a prefix for its class names. We understand that it has been customary in Cocoa to use a short capitalized acronym as prefix, but we see this practice as problematic in that it becomes almost impossible for framework vendors not to collide with each other.

66,2014-03-14 09:48:03,"I appreciate all the good and valid viewpoints @kspangsege. And you are absolute right that the right theoretical technical solution is to use Tightdb. But just now, I don't think that's what's driving the decision. It's more perception and the desire to blend in. And I think we get fewer ""lifted eyebrowns"" if we go with TDB. And I don't think any ObjC programmer will look down on us for that. So that's what I suggest we do for now and during our closed beta period.

But I'm fine with not closing the discussion here and seek input in our talks with people during the beta period.

I have this object:


And I initialize it:
`let road = RoadObject()`

which has this `LinkingObjects` property:

`let roadNumbers = LinkingObjects.init(fromType: RoadNumberObject.self, property: ""territory"")`

I create at my ViewModel this property to get an array with the linking objects:

`let roadNumbers: Variable<[RoadNumberObject]>`

I initialize it (by creating an `Array` from the `LinkingObjects` property):

`self.roadNumbers = Variable(self.road.roadNumbers.toArray())`

And I am trying to bind an `Observer` from the `LinkingObjects` so I can track the changes and access them easily through the `Variable` (I am using the same realm everywhere by the way, and I do not access it in this case from a thread other than the Main one) :



As soon as my ViewModel is initialized it crashes. I back traced the issue and the problem arises when I try to bind. I checked it as an `Observable` (not a `Variable`) and it doesn't crash, but I would like to use the variable for convenience.

The line where it crashes is:

`bool read_only() const { return schema_mode == SchemaMode::ReadOnly; }`

in the `Config` method in the `shared_realm.hpp` file

It doesn't happen though with a `ReplaySubject`, or a `PublishSubject`. Only with a Variable and a BehaviorSubject

It also doesn't happen if I initialize the `Variable` with an empty array (`Variable([])`). It only happens when it is already initialized as `Variable(self.road.roadNumbers.toArray())`

One solution I found is if I initialize the Variable with an empty array and on the subscription I place `.startWith(self.road.roadNumbers.toArray())`",tkallioras,icanzilb
4714,2017-03-05 14:14:02,"## Goals

I'm a bit of panicking over this since it's a production-level issue we're dealing with at the moment. 

We're using RxRealm that wraps Realm object notifications to perform some change observing for object. I noticed that after creating objects, they randomly ""disappears"", and then noticed that whenever this Observable is being used, not just an object or two are gone, but actually my entire Realm file is randomly being deleted (or is never there to begin with?), and not just the Realm file but also the auxiliary files. 

Trying to create a new Realm object doesn't seem to create a fresh file, as well, at this point.

Discussing with @icanzilb (maintainer of RxRealm), it seems RxRealm is only a wrapper around the Realm notifications so this seems like a Realm issue and not a RxRealm issue.

**Important:** This seems to only happen the first time ever the app runs (when rebooting the app it will create a fresh realm file and continue)

I would truly appreciate your help as I'm not sure anymore what's going on and this is causing serious havoc. 

The observable code in question:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/605076/23587893/09609372-0183-11e7-92a0-ac6f38b37f45.png)

## Expected Results

The Realm file(s) should be consistently available but seems to get destroyed randomly by something more lower-level, or even not being created to begin with.

## Actual Results

When using the following code to check for the existence of the files:



If the observing code is there, it outputs: 


If the observing code is replaced with `ongoingOrder = .empty()` (e.g. not there), it outputs:



That is the only difference within the entire app for that situation.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Delete app completely from simulator 
2. Open app that tries to create a realm / create some objects 
3. Have the observing code in the app (for me its in a Singleton).
4. At some points look for the existence of the realm file or try to fetch objects from the realm, the file doesn't exist and the objects aren't returned

If 3 isn't at hand (no observing code), the Realm file exists as described in the ""Actual Results"" section.

## Code Sample

Described above, also providing the code that creates the Realm.
As you can see it's just storing it in the Application Support folder, making sure it exists before setting it.

Right now, we (attempt to) dispatch our sync progress notifications onto the same thread upon which they were registered. We do this to conform to the behavior of our Realm, collection, and object notifications. This works great if the user registers their sync progress notifications on the main thread, and falls down if they try to do it on any other thread.

We wanted to revisit this design decision so we can fix the feature and its semantics. First, I think it might be okay for these types of notifications to be dispatched to a thread other than the one the notification was registered on. Our other notifications all deal specifically with changes to thread-confined objects, which is why it's important to user experience that they run on the same thread they were registered on. However, sync progress notifications don't deal directly with any Realm objects. The sync objects they deal with are all thread safe. More importantly, the biggest use case of a sync progress notification block is to update UI.

With this being said, there are at least three options we can take to fix how this feature works:

1. Dispatch notification blocks to the main queue. The advantage is that users can call UIKit methods directly from their notification blocks. The disadvantage is that, given how frequently the notifications are fired, we risk degrading app performance by flooding the main queue.

2. Dispatch notification blocks to a serial queue we create for this purpose. The advantage is that we don't flood the main queue, and we can configure the queue for our needs. The disadvantage is that we need to call out in our documentation that the app is responsible for throttling and dispatching to the main thread to modify UI.

3. Implement object store throttling, and dispatch notification blocks to the main queue. Object store throttling, in the absence of timers, would work by using the C++ time APIs to avoid forwarding any notifications to the binding during a cooldown period. The biggest disadvantage of this method is that the bindings might be stuck with stale date (e.g. if the last notifications come in during cooldown, but after cooldown ends network traffic stops and no more notifications come in).",austinzheng,jpsim

For example, we've had similar issues in [realm-js](https://github.com/realm/realm-js) and we've had to port and duplicate part of the solution there, but that's not a sustainable approach.

4431,2016-12-10 18:05:09,"Hi Realm Folk,

I was speaking with @jpsim in person and I mentioned the issue I'm having. I assumed it was because of Xcode 8.2 beta but he said to file an issue. So below, I'll do my best to show to reproduce the issue. Its really easy.

Also, the pod file I'm using is pasted below. I made it based on the getting started guide on realm.io. I just changed the Swift version to match what is in Xcode 8.2 beta, Swift 3.0.2



## Goals

The goal is to make a macOS / Cocoa application that uses realm via cocoa pods.

## Expected Results

1. Make a new Xcode project for macOS cocoa application
1. Add pod file
1. Run pod install
1. Open XCWorkspace
1. Select the macOS app scheme
1. Compile

## Actual Results

1. Make a new Xcode project for macOS cocoa application
1. Add pod file
1. Run pod install
1. Open XCWorkspace
1. Select the macOS app scheme
1. Compile
1. Get compile error below

(full text at bottom of post)



## Steps to Reproduce

1. Make a new Xcode project for macOS cocoa application
1. Add pod file
1. Run pod install
1. Open XCWorkspace
1. Select the macOS app scheme
1. Compile

## Temporary Workaround

I have found a temporary workaround. Although it gets clobbered every time Cocoapods touches your project again. But I can find all .h files for Realm. There are two folders with .h files: Realm/Headers, Realm/Realm. If I select all the .h files in the File Navigator in Xcode and then go to the ""Target Membership"" area of the right side of Xcode and change their target membership in their pod dependency from Project to Public, the issue is resolved. See attached screenshot:

<img width=""960"" alt=""screen_shot_2016-12-09_at_15_03_28"" src=""https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7349616/21075163/14a5507a-bec0-11e6-8a77-70cb6763bbfb.png"">

## Code Sample

No code needed. Once Cocoapods adds realm to the project, builds fail.

## Version of Realm and Tooling

Realm version: ?

Realm/RealmSwift 2.1.1 (auto chosen by cocoa pods)

Xcode version: ?

Xcode 8.2 beta (8C30a)

iOS/OSX version: ?

Sierra 10.12.1 (16B2657)

Do all your background async db read/write transactions code blocks in a single serialized dispatch queue in swift. Now you have at most 1 version of db in non-ui thread.

The catch is that of course, you will block other realm async background code blocks and you have just manually ""removed"" the ""concurrency"" feature of realm. On the other hand, you only block other background realm work, so UI is not effected. There is a fundamental difference between concurrency and speed. Concurrency is not speed. So with this method, you only sacrifice concurrency, but not speed.  ~~Parallel writes~~Multiversioning in realm, or any other ~~concurrent~~/mvcc systems which allows limited concurrency,  are not free and are actually very costly.

Edited: remove the incorrect note about parallel writes per @bmunkholm comments and further cleaned up the reply.

Changes:
- Object server tests now each use unique URLs for synced Realms
- Object server multiprocess tests now use separate Realm files for child and server processes
- RLMFileManager API changed so that an instance can be created with a custom root directory path
- Private RLMSyncManager API added to specify a custom root directory path for testing purposes
- Cleaned up RLMSyncManager_Private.hpp to reduce number of imports
- Test code now swizzles `[RLMSyncManager defaultManager]` to return a special instance that is created anew for each test

The new high-level design is:
- RLMSchema and its children no longer contains any Realm-instance specific data (no table columns, no cached table accessors, no KVO tracking), and so we no longer need to make a shallow copy of it per RLMRealm. It does still store the accessor classes, and as a result the separate accessor cache is no longer needed.
- All of the per-RLMRealm data that we need in addition to what the ObjectStore Schema stores is tracked in a new RLMObjectInfo class, which stores the table accessors, KVO info, and provides an efficient lookup of table columns from property indexes.
- Everything that previously stored a table column now stores a property index and looks up the table column on each use. This has a small (~1-2%) negative impact on accessor performance.

3854,2016-07-11 18:00:42,"Calling `renamePropertyForClass:` replaces the object schema with one read from the group, which makes it possible to access all of the other deleted properties. An example test that currently passes, but shouldn't:



This is mostly harmless, but it means that the reported target schema is not what schema the Realm will have after the migration, and it exposes some useful functionality in a _really weird_ way.

Fixing the immediate bug would be quite simple, but it would be a breaking change. OTOH, it's very unlikely that anyone is actually relying on this, so maybe we could get away with it? I think the other option would be to make it possible to always access deleted properties on the ""new"" object in migrations. This would also be somewhat weird as we'd want to still not include them in the object's schema.

@bdash @jpim Thoughts?

The immediate relevance of this is that I'm changing the relevant code and preserving the existing behavior would be more work than fixing it.

This eliminates any dependency on the private members of the schema classes and makes the query code ready for runtime schema changes. The slowdown from the extra column number lookups is in the range of a few percent.

Refactor the code by putting most of the free functions into a class that stores the Schema, Query and Group to avoid having to pass around quite so many values to every single function.

I think it's a reasonable thing to expose. It looks like a user also wanted serial, async reads https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/3755, so choosing between concurrent/serial queues might be another reason to specify. Finally, named queues might be beneficial for debugging.

@bdash Any suggestions of a better naming scheme? We could write them as functions on the dispatch queue / top level functions I guess. The Realm could even be inferred based on the arguments (throwing if not the same for each). This kinda makes the queue a more prevalent part of the API though, so it doesn't fit well with your first concern.

I don't think this should be a huge surprise to users given that Realm objects are thread confined, and there's no guarantee what thread a queue runs on.

We also discussed the Objective-C overloads. We decided that a reasonable solution would be to only include the queue parameter in the most complicated overload rather than including every combination of conveniences.

There are a couple of members (like `count`) that are defined in a superclass marked as `:nodoc:`, which means that Jazzy won't generate documentation for them. I will probably end up moving those methods into the public API subclass so that we can generate documentation for them. (@jpsim)

## Building Realm from source for Xcode 8 Beta

**Important**: Realm for Xcode 8 is not officially supported; the instructions below are intended for developers who are working to port their applications to Swift 2.3 or Swift 3, or otherwise using Xcode 8. During the preview period, the only way to obtain Realm for Xcode 8 is by building from source; we are not supporting dependency managers or providing pre-packaged binaries.

**Prerequisites**: you must have a valid Apple Developer account, with certificates for iOS and/or macOS. Go to https://developer.apple.com and update your certificates if necessary.
1. Clone the Realm Cocoa repository. (Run the Terminal command `git clone git@github.com:realm/realm-cocoa.git` in whatever directory you want the repository to be stored in.)
2. Open _build.sh_ (it is located in the root project directory).
3. Find the line that reads: `CODESIGN_PARAMS=""CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY= CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO""`, and change it to just read `CODESIGN_PARAMS=""""`. (It is line 29 in the file.)
4. Open the Realm Cocoa Xcode project (_Realm.xcodeproj_).
5. If a dialog window appears asking whether to ""Convert to Current Swift Syntax?"", press the ""Later"" button.
6. Click on the Realm project in the Project Navigator.
7. Click on the ""Realm"" target.
8. Click on the ""Build Settings"" tab (make sure ""All"" options are shown, not just ""Basic""), and scroll down to the ""Signing"" section.
9. Expand the ""Code Signing Identity"" field by clicking the triangle.
10. For the ""Debug"" and ""Release"" sub-options, choose a ""Mac Developer"" identity from the drop-down menu (in most cases, just choose the one within the ""Automatic"" section).
11. If you wish to build Realm for an iOS app (iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Watch), for the ""iPhone\* SDK"" sub-options choose an ""iPhone Developer"" identity from the drop-down menu (in most cases, choose an appropriate identity from within the ""Identities in Keychain"" section).
12. Click on the ""General"" tab.
13. Under the ""Signing"" category, press the""Enable Development Signing"" button, and then uncheck the ""Automatically Manage Signing"" checkbox.
14. Under ""Signing (Debug)"" and ""Signing (Release)"", choose the Apple Developer team associated with the certificates you chose in steps 10 and 11 from the drop-down menus. (If there is only one team listed, just choose that one.)
15. If you want to build Realm Swift, repeat steps 6 through 14 for the ""RealmSwift"" target. (If you want to build for Swift 2.3, activate the ""Use Legacy Swift Language Version"" build setting.)
16. Choose the correct scheme (_Realm_ or _RealmSwift_) and device. If you want to build Realm for an OS X application, choose ""My Mac"". Otherwise choose the appropriate ""Generic _*OS_ Device"".
17. Build the project.
18. In the Project Navigator, under the ""Products"" group, right-click on ""Realm.framework"" and select ""Show in Finder"" to open up the folder containing the built frameworks.
19. Drag _Realm.framework_ (and, if using Realm Swift, _RealmSwift.framework_) into your Xcode project. Follow the instructions at https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#dynamic-install to complete setup.

3. Find the line that reads: `CODESIGN_PARAMS=""CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY= CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO""`, and change it to just read `CODESIGN_PARAMS=""""`. (It is line 29 in the file.)
4. Open the Realm Cocoa Xcode project (_Realm.xcodeproj_).
5. If a dialog window appears asking whether to ""Convert to Current Swift Syntax?"", press the ""Later"" button.
6. Click on the Realm project in the Project Navigator.
7. Click on the ""Realm"" target.
8. Click on the ""Build Settings"" tab (make sure ""All"" options are shown, not just ""Basic""), and scroll down to the ""Signing"" section.
9. Expand the ""Code Signing Identity"" field by clicking the triangle.
10. For the ""Debug"" and ""Release"" sub-options, choose a ""Mac Developer"" identity from the drop-down menu (in most cases, just choose the one within the ""Automatic"" section).
11. If you wish to build Realm for an iOS app (iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Watch), for the ""iPhone\* SDK"" sub-options choose an ""iPhone Developer"" identity from the drop-down menu (in most cases, choose an appropriate identity from within the ""Identities in Keychain"" section).
12. Click on the ""General"" tab.
13. Under the ""Signing"" category, press the""Enable Development Signing"" button, and then uncheck the ""Automatically Manage Signing"" checkbox.
14. Under ""Signing (Debug)"" and ""Signing (Release)"", choose the Apple Developer team associated with the certificates you chose in steps 10 and 11 from the drop-down menus. (If there is only one team listed, just choose that one.)
15. If you want to build Realm Swift, repeat steps 6 through 14 for the ""RealmSwift"" target. (If you want to build for Swift 2.3, activate the ""Use Legacy Swift Language Version"" build setting.)
16. Choose the correct scheme (_Realm_ or _RealmSwift_) and device. If you want to build Realm for an OS X application, choose ""My Mac"". Otherwise choose the appropriate ""Generic _*OS_ Device"".
17. Build the project.
18. In the Project Navigator, under the ""Products"" group, right-click on ""Realm.framework"" and select ""Show in Finder"" to open up the folder containing the built frameworks.
19. Drag _Realm.framework_ (and, if using Realm Swift, _RealmSwift.framework_) into your Xcode project. Follow the instructions at https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#dynamic-install to complete setup.

dynamic API (since the properties array visible to you will actually match what
you passed in), is required to support having the array of properties be a
subset of the table columns, and simplifies handling columns being rearranged a bit.

Also a little faster since it's O(N) rather than O(N log N), but if you have
enough properties for it to be even remotely noticeable something has gone very
wrong.

Here is a helper class that I'm hoping can help our users write more robust unit tests involving Realms. It's basically a helper class based off our `RLMTestCase` base test case, but with no XCTest dependencies.

The idea is that a user would create an instance of this class belonging to every test case class they make which uses Realms. They'd have to override `invokeTest` on their test class to call the helper's `invokeTest` method. They'd use this class's methods to perform async and sync work, but write their tests as usual otherwise.

This isn't so much of a review as it is asking what you think of the basic concept. How is the API? Could it use more helper methods? Is it too cumbersome? Let me know your thoughts.

(If this is something we want to pursue further I'll add documentation and a Swift wrapper.)

If this is approved I'll fix all the tests that broke because of the lack of ""isEqual:"".

- Changed build.sh to generate symlink for support file whenever a build is triggered
- build.sh now updates the support file symlink whenever a build is triggered from the command line
- Added a new Xcode build target to generate the Realm support file. This target is now a dependency of the Realm, Realm iOS static, and various test build targets

3665,2016-05-28 00:47:05,"The current fine-grained notifications approach makes it challenging to support scenarios where the UI is updated before the data model, rather than the reactive approach of the model being the canonical source of truth that the UI merely displays. The simplest motivating use-case is UITableView reordering; when using the built-in functionality for dragging rows around the delegate is merely notified of changes already displayed in the UI, and re-applying those changes in the collection notification block after the Realm is committed will corrupt the order to the UITV. Because notifications are coalesced, users can't reasonably filter out these redundant updates themselves. and even if they could it would be very easy to get wrong.

We should expose a variant of `Realm.write(_:)` that would specify that the transaction should not produce notifications on the current thread, as the things they want to update with the notifications are already up-to-date. In addition, this variant of write transactions would block until all async notifications are ready and delivers them, since otherwise the UI could easily get ""out of sync"".

An alternative approach would be to instead let the user pass in the tokens for notification blocks which they want to suppress. This is more flexible and makes it work with commits on a different thread from the notified thread, but maybe would make the API even more complex.

@tgoyne has implemented a proof of concept of this in #3439, and there's more discussion in that thread, but that work is currently on hold.

3571,2016-11-22 01:45:06,"The **good news** is, Realm internally already computes move operations.
The **bad news** is, move operations are converted to insertions and deletions at the very end of the change calculation algorithm: https://github.com/realm/realm-object-store/blob/28ac73d8881189ac0b6782a6a36f4893f326397f/src/impl/collection_change_builder.cpp#L35-L38

I vaguely recall this being done due to UITableView APIs not handling move operations very nicely, that they would crash in certain scenarios despite having perfectly valid results. As this never happens with insert/delete pairs, and that this feature would be used to power UITableView's 99% of the time, we opted to ""flatten"" moves to work around this issue.

I'm fuzzy on the details, so unfortunately I don't recall what those problematic cases were, or if we filed a radar, or what the status of that potential radar would be, so I apologize for that.

@jpsim typical use case if that helps you understand the need for this:



`standalonePerson.realm` is nil once detached from the Realm, but `standalonePerson.dog` isn't detached, so the dog gets modified in the DB even if the `Person` _is_ detached from the DB

I think it's necessary to remove all new schema validation altogether because of this, and other multi-version schema change scenarios.

How about falling back to looking up the property by name in the new Realm? This would allow the following scenarios:

@TimOliver has been working on some documentation around this, but it's not live yet on our site since it's still pending review, but I'll post it here because I think it would be useful to you:

### Using Realm with Background App Refresh

On iOS 8 and above, files inside apps are automatically encrypted using [`NSFileProtection`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSFileManager_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/constant_group/File_Protection_Values) whenever the device is locked. If your app attempts to do any work involving Realm while the device is locked and its parent directory isn't set to `NSFileProtectionNone`, an `open() failed: Operation not permitted` exception will be thrown.

To avoid this, it is necessary to ensure the `NSFileProtectionNone` file protection attribute is applied to both the Realm file itself and its [auxiliary files](https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest#auxiliary-realm-files). Since the auxiliary files can sometimes be lazily created and deleted mid-operation, it is recommended to apply the file protection attribute to the parent folder containing these Realm files to ensure the attribute is properly applied to all of them.



If your app contains other files for which you don't want to disable protection, we recommended that these Realm files be moved to their own separate directory.

As seen in the second commit, it is currently possible to define an `Object` subclass, overwriting all initializers, which are declared as required, which perfectly compiles, whose object schema validates, but which can't be used universally at runtime as it e.g. fails when trying to access `valueForKey` on a `Results` collection of that object. The error in this case is:

3257,2016-04-19 13:50:24,"Did a walk through of the Cocoa API with @nhachicha, reviewing from his perspective from a Java binding developer. We found most of the actionable feedback to be done on the Java side. See this comment for his action items following the review: https://github.com/realm/realm-java/issues/1594#issuecomment-197904615

The cocoa team has identified a number of APIs that should be deprecated. See #3442, #2593, #1324, #3396 & #2849. Review of those deprecations will be delegated to those pull requests rather than this overarching ticket.

In a more general review of the Objective-C API, the biggest sore point in my opinion is the concept of a default Realm. `[RLMRealm defaultRealm]` offers no error handling, the shorthand default Realm methods add a heavy layer of duplication to the API, and finally the mutable default configuration has been a source of confusion and bugs for users.

However, so many users rely on the default Realm that it would be unwise to break it at this point in time. Might be worth considering an alternative with Realm 2.0 😉.

The migration & dynamic APIs are also ripe for improvements after a 1.0 release, but not urgent enough to invest before then.

The Swift API isn't burdened by most of the default Realm problems the Objective-C version has thanks to default parameter values, but the mutable default configuration might be worth deprecating post 1.0 too, since it really doesn't save all that much code in the Swift API compared to storing desired configurations in user-defined global variables.

---

All that to say that other than existing work to refine the API as outlined above, I don't think any further API refinements are necessary before a 1.0 release.

There are two places where schema validation will fail.
One is here: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/master/Realm/RLMRealm.mm#L350

It is in the `Realm::init` method that is called from `openSharedRealm` method.

Another is here: https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/blob/master/Realm/RLMRealm.mm#L374

The former is called when a schema is specified with `objectClasses`,  the latter is called when that the schema isn't specified.

The problem is, the latter is called directly from the Objective-C layer, so  it is difficult to handle deleting and re-creating the file. It is also difficult to replace the Realm instances within the method.

Also it is difficult to determine whether the caller is former or latter. 

Do you have any thoughts?
",kishikawakatsumi,jpsim
3222,2016-04-15 18:45:48,"@tgoyne @bdash 

I need your advice. What do you think I should do?

It seems difficult for me that deleting Realm file when migration is needed is done within the ObjectStore code.

Schema validations are done in two places. 
The former is done during the initialization of the Realm instance. It is difficult to re-create Realm instance in this timing since the initialization method has an exclusive lock.

The latter is done much after the Realm was instantiated. So it needs to return the method to the Objective-C++ code to release and re-create Realm instance.

3095,2016-01-13 18:08:43,"Hi @mrigdon, yes you have to keep that migration block in your app, because this new version of your app can be installed over any other previous version of the app. But the migration block will only ever run when applying the migration, which will only happen _at most_ once per schema version number.

> I asked Stack Overflow but got no response that's why I'm opening an issue

I assume you're referring to [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34758675/realm-swift-update-all-model-objects-and-remove-migration) StackOverflow question that was posted a few minutes before you filed this GitHub issue? That's [since been answered](http://stackoverflow.com/a/34759403/373262) by @TimOliver:

> Yes. Since you used a migration to bump the `schemaVersion` number of the Realm file, that migration block is required with the assumption that another migration may be required in future.
> 
> If you want to completely reset the migrations and remove the migration block, you'll need to delete your Realm file from disk and recreate it (i.e., simply deleting just the objects isn't enough).

For future reference, there's no need to post questions multiple times in different places. If you follow the guidelines described in the [Getting Help](https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#getting-help) or [Reporting Realm Issues](https://realm.io/docs/objc/latest/#reporting-realm-issues) sections of our docs, we'll find it!

I created reproducible sample project https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/Crash_Destruction-of-mutex-in-use/

#### Step to reproduce
1. Clone the repository and launch the app.
2. Wait for a few minutes (1-10 minutes) until the app will crash.

#### Note:

It is easier to reproduce on devices than simulators.
On devices, `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` in `advance_transact` was occurred in my environment.
On simulators, `Destruction of mutex in use` or `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` in `advance_transact` were occurred.

It seems to send a notification to the freed Realm instances.
According to the screenshot below, the app crashes on thread 5. At this time, the Realm instance is deallocated on other thread whenever (Thread 10 in the screenshot). 

The Realm instances on thread 5 and thread 10 were same (`0x0000000161c7fbf0`).

Essentially @ajitam was building a framework that bundled Realm & some Realm models. So to support users of that framework also being able to use Realm without being effected by the framework's usage, the `+[RLMObject shouldIncludeInDefaultSchema]` class method on each of the framework's model classes need to be overridden to return `false`, and then explicitly list those object types in the `objectClasses`/`objectTypes` array on the configuration object used to open the Realm.

Supporting the framework user using a different version of Realm from the one you're using in the same process would be tricky. All of the obj-c class names would need to be mangled similar to how `cocoapods-packager` does (but without trying to mangle anything else), and then build the library as a dynamic framework which has Realm statically linked into it.

As this verification is very specific, we should think of whether we could do that in a more general fashion at a different place. There are different options, which I want to layout here, so that we could decide on whether we settle on one of them or don't do any verification like that at all. It all boils down to enforcing our modified `RLMObject` class contract in differentiation to the expectations given from Foundation/Cocoa/`NSObject`. For all options, it could likely make sense to reduce the performance impact by executing them only in the Debug configuration and so not affecting distributed builds of the user's apps.

### Variant A: Check type on initial / every value access

Instead of relying on KVC directly via `valueForKey:`, we could instead encapsulating retrieving the properties value in a method / function. This could then contain further type verification and assert when the type conflicts with the expectations.

### Variant B: Scan & forbid overwritten alternate KVC accessors

As Realm implements custom accessors on `RLMObject` subclasses, we could just completely forbid users to implement alternate KVC methods. (e.g. `is<Key>`, `get<Key>`, …)

Wasn't sure what style you all wanted for documentation/testing so I just guestimated based on code elsewhere (sorta shooting from the hip!)

As a user I can already get this functionality myself by using an unsafeBitCast on the result of KVC, but it's nice to wrap away these types of casts so the user doesn't feel like they're doing something wrong.

We will keep trying harder to keep investing enough time into documenting and explaining our thoughts and ideas behind the API design and not only in moving forward with fixing bugs, implementing new features etc. 

It's not always easy to keep up in a fast moving environment like ours with Swift, especially with things like documentation, which are likely the most important as it's the first part of our database you come in touch with. But you have to see that some of our users are still stuck with Swift 1.2. Understandably! If you have a larger codebase, the changes required [are immense and it's not a trivial effort](https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/648671170695335936).
We invested massive efforts in trying to keep up with the pace of Apple and are still supporting two Swift versions at the same time, with our [own tooling around documentation](https://github.com/realm/jazzy), we've build to make that possible for us [and others](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaDocs-Colo/). We seemed to have missed the best point in time to fully go Swift 2.0 with our docs.
It's not quite true though, that we didn't take care for our website since 2014. You'd wonder if you'd see what massive changes we did to that since then. I will note though that this was seemingly still not enough. :memo: 

Gladly, I can report that we made some good progress on that. @jpsim just made sure that we automatically verify our code snippets in our documentation and discovered some typos and outdated snippets, we didn't quite caught when going through manually for every release. That's just a tiny piece in the puzzle, but one which will help us also in future to provide up-to-date code snippets. :tada:

1) That will be addressed soon - we're working on that, right now.
2) The API docs should be up-to-date as they are re-generated by CI on release. What are you missing / what is wrong specifically?
3) The examples in the repo are also built by CI to ensure that they always work with the latest release. I can also confirm that the examples especially in the here relevant [swift-2.0 directory](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/tree/master/examples/ios/swift-2.0) work for me locally. Do you want to describe what kind of issues you're experiencing specifically?
4) So Simple examples are there. :relieved: I'd agree that there is a need for even more advanced examples. You're really welcome to describe for what kind of use-cases, you would expect further examples and more help from us.

I am using Realm.io to build a file manager. Right now I fetch a set of files into an RLMResults object and display them as a list on a table view. The issue is I would like to allow swipe to delete on a file and don't want to refresh the entire table view. There should be a way for me to remove a single object from the RLMResults collection.

1. `-[RLMRealm migrateRealm:]` doesn't appear to respect the schema version from the configuration, instead using only the schema version set via the legacy APIs. @tgoyne's change in 16194870 fixes this issue. We should pull that change into a point update.
2. With version 0.96 you'll need to explicitly state that your `NSString *`, `NSDate *` and `NSData *` properties are required by implementing `+requiredProperties` in each model class to avoid requiring a migration. Those data types are now considered to be nullable unless `+requiredProperties` says otherwise.

2. The Swift tests only run on Swift 2 in Debug mode because they rely on `@testable`. Funnily enough, dynamic objects work for the Swift tests.

In core master, it's no longer private so our hack is no longer necessary.

The two most suspect pieces:
- I was caching my realm instance per-thread, to avoid the overhead of creating and configuring it every single time I accessed it.
- I would use a different realm path depending on if encryption was enabled or disabled. It's possible that something else was wrong with this and caused me to access a realm at one path, and then at another. (From a fresh install, so both would be brand new, but perhaps this causes the migration code / dispatch once to fall over?)

@TimOliver, I were trying several things, but I got no luck. :crying_cat_face: 

Using `[[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] launchApplicationAtURL:self.browserUrl options:0 configuration:configuration error:&error]`. or replacing with `options:NSWorkspaceLaunchDefault` seems to work, but it fails to open Realm File on the subsequent runs (meaning that closing the Realm file window without quitting the Realm Browser and go to File > Open Realm ... in order to open Browser with Realm file again)

I am not familiar enough with Apple Script so unfortunately I couldn't make the `[NSWorkspace openURLs:withAppBundleIdentifier:options:additionalEventParamDescriptor:launchIdentifiers:]` to work. 
:(

So, I decided that to the least having a check from plugin's standpoint is doable from my side. I went ahead and implemented those quickly in this PR. If you have a smarter way for this, I am all ears.

Ahh, okay then. It looks like we've ironically got just the wrong set of API combinations to make that possible. That's a bit of a shame. Sorry to have made you go away and research that! I might keep it in mind and see if there's a better way to do it (Even if it means some kind of direct communication between the plugin and the Browser).

I reviewed your code, and that looks like the best solution at present to me. That'll cover the portions of the multiple file handling operations that weren't getting covered on Realm Browser's side.

Thus, by recommendation of @jpsim in the issue (https://github.com/kittinunf/RealmBrowser-Plugin/issues/1), I think it is a nice idea to extend the functionality of Realm Browser plugin itself by combining my implementation into yours. This PR is to serve this purpose, and ultimately deprecate my plugin once it is merged.

Awesome! Thank you so much for this! As someone who debugs Realm files in a production app, this sort of thing is incredibly useful for me!

That being said, I think I found a bit of a problem, although it might be an issue on Realm Browser's side that I could potentially take care of.

I just tried using the plugin on my own copy of Xcode, and this happened:
![realmbrowseroverload](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/429119/8542459/6d5e0380-24c8-11e5-8272-ed656ddbee34.jpg)

One of my apps uses Realm in a pretty crazy way. It has a standard default.realm file where all of the main data is kept, and then for each user-generated file in the app, it has a subsequent .realm file that stores cached information about each file. When I opened the Browser via the plugin, it looks like it was instructed to open every single .realm file in my Simulator device's directory, including all the cache files.

In any case, it might be best if I include some safeguards in Realm Browser for these kinds cases (Maybe a prompt that appears when a certain number of Realm files are opened at once)

1948,2015-05-15 20:49:35,"This is significantly incomplete, but I wanted to make sure no one had objections to the basic idea before I spend too much time on it.

For KVO support on keypaths, I need to keep the observed linked-to objects alive for as long as the source object (i.e. when observing `foo.bar.baz`, `foo.bar` needs to continue to exist as long as `foo` does (or until it's changed)). The simplest way to do this is to just store the linked-to object in the ivar for the link property, and update it if needed in the property getter.

Outside of KVO this also gives a bit of a performance improvement when the same property is read repeatedly, and might make ignored properties work more sensibly. Currently if you do `obj.link.ignoredProperty = 5` and then immediately read `obj.link.ignoredProperty`, you'll get 0 (or whatever the default is), because you get different objects each time you read from `link`. With this change it'll work correctly, but I'm worried that there could be confusion with the related case of two different accessors for the same row, where maybe a user would expect both accessors to return the same linked object?

Any thoughts on if this matters, or any other potential problems from this?

Unfortunately, upon removing the beta badge, all that was left behind a simple, flat, black 'R' on it's own. Needless to say, it looked pretty plain, and definitely didn't fit the app icon design standards of OS X Yosemite.

So, ideally, before we launch v1.0, it'd be great to have a nicer looking icon for the Realm Browser. :)

I just spent around 10 minutes playing with my copy of [Element 3D](https://www.videocopilot.net/products/element2/) and came up with this image:

It's a OpenGL-rendered version of the Realm 'R' in the same 3D perspective as the Yosemite system apps. It's just to get the ball rolling for now, so what do you think? :)

With the static library file you provided here https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues/1516 i still get a crash after i added a writeCopyToPath: to our app directly after launch to shrink the database as suggested in the cocoa docs. 

The crash happens when reading an object from the realm and it only happens when the realm file was big before it was compacted (e.g. from 50 megabytes to 500 kilobytes after shrinking). I can launch the app after the crash again and i dont get a crash then anymore.

1584,2015-05-19 07:59:28,"@segiddins @jpsim @bdash  How do you plan to support schemaVersion/MigrationBlock?

Currently on the Java side we have two separate methods for this:
- `RealmConfiguration.schemaVersion(42)`
- `RealmConfiguration.migration(new MyCustomMigration())`

It might make sense to combine these as having a version above 0 makes very little sense without a migration block at the same time. Something along the lines of
- `RealmConfiguration.schemaVersion(42, new MyMigrationBlock())`

Counter to that is `deleteIfMigrationNeeded` in which case having a migration block doesn't make much sense.

Our current behaviour is this: 

1) If only schemaVersion is set we make a no-op migration behind the scenes that try to upgrade the version number. Schema is validated afterwards and throw an exception if there is mismatch.

2) If newSchemaVersion > currentSchemaVersion and a migration block is set. This migration will be called when first opening the Realm. We also have a method on the Realm for manually triggering this migration. Useful if you want to upgrade on a background thread: `Realm.migrateRealm(RealmConfiguration)`

3) Setting a migration block without a schemaVersion is a no-op, ie. migration code is never called. We might want to log a warning or throw an exception for this.

4) Setting a newSchemaVersion < currentSchemaVersion will throw an exception when opening the Realm.

5) Setting newSchemaVersion == currentSchemaVersion and a schema mismatch is detected will throw an exception when opening the Realm.

1272,2014-12-31 18:09:21,"There are two overarching design principles I am hoping to seewith these apis:

1 - The mapping apis should be on a fundamental level decoupled from the other Realm apis. We don't want to bake in logic to apply transforms in the validation methods as this approach doesn't scale for nested objects - even if we had a creation method which took a translation and an object, users would also need to supply transforms for all nested child objects and we would have to pass the transforms throughout the object creation pipeline which isn't practical.

The simplest (and most common) approach to decouple these apis is to any mapping before using any Realm apis at all. This has the benefit of being completely decoupled, with the downside of having duplicate/copy the entire object tree before insertion. Another approach which avoids the need to copy data is to have an wrapper object which applies transforms when accessing object properties. The wrapper object can then be passed to Realm when creating objects and can be applied on demand. Accessing nested object properties simply wrap these objects on access so this approach should scale and perform well. My hope was is the apis we end up with support both models, standalone value transformation and object wrapping.

2 - The apis should be declarative whenever possible. In general this makes apis a lot easier to use, and the code a lot easier to read. I don't see why we can't have a single initialization for a mapper which takes a dictionary that maps keys to either a source keypath, a transformation block, or any other supported mapping. 

In general, I was imaging the example in this pr looking something like:



which functionally is very similar to what you have proposed, but allows you to specify a mapping at runtime using a single initializer which I think is much more user friendly.

There are still some issues that need to be worked out, mostly that mapper/transformation creation also may need to take an objectSchema and the entire schema being operated on to support nested objects properly. It's possible to infer this information from object being transformed, so this may not be needed in the end - in any case we need to give this some more thought to work through the details.

Hopefully this will give you better sense of what I am hoping for from these apis. I've discussed some of this at various times with @tgoyne and @jpsim but I don't think we ever reached consensus on what we planned to build. If they agree with this overall design I think we can move forward with nailing down the api details pretty quickly.

1243,2014-12-19 09:27:21,"Just had a conversation about this with @astigsen and @bmunkholm. Takeaways:
1. We believe that now that we have `invalidate`, there are very few legitimate cases in which you would need to compact files in-place. That said, there will be a few, so we do need to have an in-place compaction method somewhere in our API. If we expose one, we have to assume people will try to use it, and as @tgoyne highlights, it’s very easy to shoot yourself in the foot with the current (& proposed) compaction methods.
2. @astigsen comments that realm/realm-core#591 may not be safe enough. There may be scenarios under which we could endure shadow writes or even corruptions if people try to read the file while it is compacted. We need to design a live compaction mechanism that assumes the file will be read while it is compacted.
3. Once it is live in core, we should expose this safe compaction as an in-place `compact` method on RLMRealm — we can debate hiding this method from our public API if we want.
4. Optionally, we can debate running `compact` automatically after people call `deleteAllObjects`, since that’s the scenarios people seem to hit most often.

1. Some indicator of whether the realm has changes that are yet to be saved to disk (is this possible?)
2. If 1 is possible, some method of flushing said changes to disk (when the user hits Apple-S)
3. NSDocument generally expects to be able to pick the document representation up off disk and move it somewhere else — it's probably possible to do that ourselves, but we would need a method of ensuring a realm is flushed to disk, then closed before moving the file elsewhere. It's possible some kind of realm to realm migration/copy might be a better option here (essentially atomically copying the contents of the realm to another location)
4. It seems like the realm file is only created after the first transaction is committed? There would need to be an option to initialise an empty realm on disk so that NSDocument is happy (it expects to be able to locate a file for the document after saving)

There's really two scenarios here that I'd love to see supported:
1. The realm file itself is the document (flat NSDocument)
2. The realm file is inside a document bundle

I'll have a bit more of a think about what else is missing — my early experiments with getting this working weren't particularly successful, but I haven't had much time to dedicate to it yet.

The iOS project was built on Yosemite (updated last night), Xcode 6.0.1, and using Realm 0.86.3. I've noticed this happen when I'm creating a default object and saving it to the Realm but only making sure I have one instance of that object ever saved. In my case I have an app where we'd expose that app to the user to allow them to create more but for now we aren't. So to proceed with that I ended up creating a service in the repo I linked earlier that had this:



I'm using a Service class here since I need to pass in the realm so I can do tests. I have a separate issue where if I try to override RLMRealm.defaultRealm (test target) I get an ambiguous error if I reference it in my app target code. So I avoid doing that by using service classes where I can pass the realm in to do tests.

In the example service above I sporadically get a swift dynamic cast conditional error (most of the time). I thought maybe if I save an object to Realm it might not be immediately available to query but in a twitter conversation with @jpsim this shouldn't be the case. I'm not sure if that's the problem but it came to mind so I tried writing the method a different way, and this solution seems to always work (tests always pass):

@tgoyne @alazier hopefully we can discuss this approach in the office tomorrow.

Major points I still dislike with this:
1. `import Realm` will still expose the entirety of the Objective-C interface. This may be easily solved by creating a new `RealmSwift` target, but I haven't tested that yet.
2. Even with a `RealmSwift` target, all `RLMObject` methods will still be exposed, since `Object` is typealiased to `RLMObject`. We could work around this by checking for either `RLMObject` or `Object` as the parent class in the binding and creating an `Object` wrapper around `RLMObject`, much like the approach taken with most of the other Swift classes here.
3. This doesn't support generic array properties. See `ArrayProperty` for details.

Point 3 seems impossible to solve in an elegant way given Swift's current state.

- ios xcode6 debug: `build/DerivedData/Realm-Xcode6/Build/Products/Debug-iphone`

So we're consistent (other than iOS Xcode5). Should we move that one to `build/DerivedData/Realm/Build/Products/{Release|Debug}-iphone`?

653,2014-07-23 07:36:11,"Hi,

I'm using latest version of xCode 6 (beta4) and I'm try using Realm in a swift iOs project with CocoaPods without any success.

I'm getting the following error on build time : 
<b>File not Found ""Realm/Realm-Bridging-Header.h"" </b>

I notice that @jpsim post a [radar](http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=5771227683618816) to solve this problem.

Until xCode team fixes the issue, is there a workaround?

Thanks,

PS : Realm looks very powerful, I can't wait for running it on my app. :)

645,2014-07-22 11:40:28,"The previous examples structure was not working very well. We had to run `sh build.sh build` to build the framework in order to build the examples. This PR moves the structure around and only introduces a single Xcode project per platform/language group, with the appropriate Realm Xcode subproject. So the new examples structure looks like this:



The process to package examples for release is:
1. Install Xcodeproj gem from master (https://github.com/CocoaPods/Xcodeproj)
2. Run `./scripts/package_examples.rb`
3. Move the folders in these locations

Follow these steps and all projects should build. Note that there are 3 `Realm.framework`'s. One for iOS, one for OSX and one for Swift (iOS).

- Codesign framework (iOS/OSX, Xcode5/Xcode6, Release/Debug)
- Use framework instead of subproject in examples
- Build framework if not built when running examples

@emanuelez note that there is no script to package these examples for release, but that shouldn't be too difficult.

# Realm Core Null v1 BETA

THIS IS A BETA RELEASE — USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. It might delete your data or cause other catastrophic events. Please report any bugs or issues on [Github](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa/issues) and clearly mention you are using the “null beta”.

## Release Notes

**Realm Core Null v1 does not expose new features to you**. What it does is silently upgrade our file format to enable null support. This is a critical step for us to validate. Without confirmation from a number of beta-testers, we will not be able to release Realm Cocoa Null Betas, which will let you have null string properties (more types will follow).

**This core release is only compatible with Realm Cocoa 0.91.2 or later.**

You can find the core release that includes null support at https://static.realm.io/downloads/core/realm-core-null-v1.zip

## Instructions

### If you are building Realm from source
1. Build https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa from master (make sure you are using a version of realm-cocoa >= 0.91.2)
2. Replace the files under core-0.89.0 with those contained in this zip
3. Rebuild and use the resulting framework in your file

### If you are using Realm through CocoaPods
1. Make sure you are using Realm version 0.91.2 or later.
2. Replace the files under Pods/Realm/core with the contents of the core folder of this zip.

### If you are using the zip releases from our website

You will not be able to test null support at this time. We may release beta binaries with null support at a later date. In the meantime you can build an equivalent .framework from source using the instructions above.

## Help!

I also don't think we need to suffix all examples with the word 'Example'

Just to specify... for the lint test I temporarily uploaded a 0.22.0 framework to static.realm.io (now deleted) and run the pod command. It resolved the version correctly, downloaded the file locally and tried to reach the documentation page for 0.22.0, which is missing, so that's where it failed.

All in all I was only interested in the version resolution and that worked fine.

",timanglade,astigsen
480,2014-06-27 22:18:35,"I think that we should keep the macro. One concern is that by using the
protocol we put it on the user to remember a lot of syntax, so every time
(they don't use the template) they will have to look up the how exactly the
protocol was supposed to be written.

With the macro it is a lot easier. You remember that there was some macro
you had to write, so you start writing RLM_... and then autocompletion
shows you the rest.

The good thing about it is also that it is self-documenting the other way.
When a new user looks at a model and there is this strange macro at the
bottom, he can command-click it and see it described what it does and why
it is needed. With the protocol it just looks like a pretty random
leftover, so he might either be puzzled or even try to remove it (since it
is in no way evident what it does or why it is needed).

- Would be nice when we have dependent prs to use the dependent branch as the base branch - not an issue here, but for big dependencies doing this will actually make it possible to review
- Now that we are starting to duplicate tests in multiple languages, we should start being a bit more diligent about how and what we are tests. To me this means actually coming up with test plans/matrixes to both make sure we are covering all our features, and not writing duplicate unnecessary tests.

416,2014-06-11 22:16:32,"- allows building with xctool, xcpretty or xcodebuild directly. xcpretty is the default because unlike xtool, it just parses xcodebuild which means that when xcodebuild gets updated (Xcode6!!), xcpretty just works whereas xctool breaks down. So you get the parsable output of xctool with the robustness of xcodebuild.
- builds/tests iOS/OSX in Release and Debug configurations (will be trivial to add support for Xcode5 and Xcode6 flavors, once that's merged)
- moved `download_core` to build.sh since it's such a small script and doesn't affect the readability of build.sh

> I feel like RLMMigration.schemaVersion should rather be RLMSchema.version. The schema has a version, not the migration. It's Person.dog.age rather than Person.dogAge.

In general I would agree, but in this case the schema pointed to by the realm will change during the course of the migration, so the version number will not remain accurate. The `schemaVersion` property really indicates the version the schema was at at the beginning of the migration - perhaps we should change the name to reflect this. Ideas?

If we go that way based on what I'm filtering out of the docs then we
should only have RLMRealm, RLMObject and RLMArray at the root and
everything else in that separate group, since that's exactly what my
ignores are meant to do. Is that what we want?
Personally I always find mismatches between Xcode and disk structure
extremely distasteful (such as RealmTests vs. Realm/RealmTests), but maybe
I haven't spent enough time in objective-C land.

By the way, I'm only removing those classes manually from our user docs in
an abundance of caution (because I think they may give some developers some
bad ideas about how to use us, or make our library look more complicated
than it really is). That's why I'm surprised we'd ever want to remove them
from the view of committers — I'm not even 100% sure we should hide them
from the view of users! :D
To be honest, I half-expected you or @alazier to step in and argue I
should add a few of those classes back to our docs :p Please do compare the
output of both `sh build.sh docs` and confirm I'm not hiding anything that
should be public…

328,2014-05-28 06:34:10,"To me it's about reflecting the design in the structure to give some kind
of clue about where to get started. It's actually to try to help newcomers!
Once there are many files (and we are getting there now), it's nice to get
a little help understanding the structure. It's not to ""hide"" anything.
Separating them in two simple buckets (PublicClasses, InternalClasses) for
a start would be a help. Or whatever logical grouping that makes sense.
Whether this logical structure is reflected in the physical structure is
less interesting to me (except if it could help tooling for docs for
example).

- Currently the project requires that the Tightdb Core is installed on your machine. 
- Realm.framework at the root level of tightdb_objc.
#### Debugging
- The build binary gets outputted into `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/RealmTools-{HASH}/Build/Products/Debug/`

@alazier for both conceptual and technical reasons, we can't move this functionality to table retrieval.

Conceptual: You might want some initial tables/data in your realm, you might want to create _many_ tables. It makes more sense to do this on the realm level than create many tables when getting a single one.

Technical: Performing write operations _after_ a realm has been created would require the realm to be ""reset"", i.e. fast-forwarded to the latest state. I'm sure @astigsen can come up with more reasons this would be difficult technically.

Also that once sync-style merge rules are in place, writes will also be implicit and we'll no longer need to update via notifications or to wrap the insert/delete in dispatch calls.

A couple of things to note:
- Everything is done in the Objective-C binding, becuase it was the easiest way, and in some respects, also the best way.
- I have introduced a new class `TDBSmartContext` which so far has support only for `tableWithName:`, nothing else. That class name is up for discussion, of course.
- The demo app shows both the old and the new way of working with TightDB (reading only). It has two 'tabs', one called 'Old' and one called 'New'. There is only one database and one table in it. Both tabs show the same database. It also has a background thread that performs a conventional write transaction once every 5 seconds where the first, middle, and last table entry is updated with a new string reflecting the number of write transactions performed so far. Try it out if you can.

I have reordered the selectors in the headers for the top-level classes (TDBContext and TDBTable), so that they are more readably and so that they present the selectors more or less in the order you would expect to need them.

There is also a huge number of selector we could remove now that we have support for object subscripting, so for now I have just moved them to the bottom.

66,2014-03-13 21:29:14,"Guys, as you know, I find the use of the `TDB` prefix as something of an abomination.

On the other hand, I understand that many of you guys like it. Tim has offered the following explanation of his point of view:

> The lack of namespacing in Objective-C clearly sucks, but I’m actually hugely in favor of prefixing with just “TDB”: it’s one of those things that make you look/feel really native to iOS and that is a huge thing we need to accomplish at this point. It’s also the rule of law as far as Apple is concerned. Additionally, it does not matter so much that someone else may be using “TDB”, as this will not create hard collisions in and of itself; we would have a real problem if there were already Objective-C classes called TDBTable (or TDBContext, etc.) in common usage, which summary searches on GitHub and Google indicates is not likely.

I understand this concern, but I would like to offer some additional thoughts that we might want to weigh in:
- Some will be angry with us, because we steel their prefix. Note the aggravated responses in http://cocoadev.com/ChooseYourOwnPrefix.
- Some will see it as anti-collaborative and dogmatic. I would.
- If we explain why we use `Tightdb` rather than an acronym, most developers will understand it, and appreciate it. We could even score extra points. See below for a concrete proposal of such an explanation.
- As long as the decision is appreciated by the experienced segment, other developers will agree.
- The use of acronyms is probably not ""the rule of law"". See for example http://cocoadev.com/ChooseYourOwnPrefix, and note how they explicitly point out that the use of an acronym is **not** mandatory.
- It is hell from a programmer when he is hit by name collisions.
- Look around you, and see how every other popular language out there has understood that name spaces are necessary.

Now, if by any chance I can convince you to stay on `Tightdb`, I propose that we add something like the following to our introductory text:

> Note that the TightDB framework uses `Tightdb` as a prefix for its class names. We understand that it has been customary in Cocoa to use a short capitalized acronym as prefix, but we see this practice as problematic in that it becomes almost impossible for framework vendors not to collide with each other.

64,2014-03-12 00:59:33,"I have added initial support for Object Subscripting on cursors so we can play with the syntax.

It mainly need some more error checking. When we get support in the basic table methods for taking native obj-c types like NSData as values, it should be easy to transition it to using them directly.

One note about the cursor object in general. I noticed that it holds a TightdbTable reference (i.e. the obj.c object) rather than a direct TableRef. I wonder if that is needed? It is a bit of unneeded overhead to have to do everything through obj-c selectors if we could have used direct method calls.

So sh build.sh test-cover (after clean and config). Will generate two XML files, binding-coverage.xml and core-coverage.xml. See the commit message for 8692494e013f0c633a5e45acdfa81b0e4ecf66e1 for more details.

It is only then that I was told that I should run a special tool instead to
accept the license agreement. Running config afterwards, clearly disallowed me
to overwrite the config, but the script didn't report this in a pretty way.
