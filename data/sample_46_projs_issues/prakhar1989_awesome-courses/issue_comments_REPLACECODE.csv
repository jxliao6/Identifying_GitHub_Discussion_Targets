focus on regression and classification methods. The syllabus includes:
linear and polynomial regression, logistic regression and linear
discriminant analysis; cross-validation and the bootstrap, model
selection and regularization methods (ridge and lasso); nonlinear
models, splines and generalized additive models; tree-based methods,
random forests and boosting; support-vector machines. Some unsupervised
learning methods are discussed: principal components and clustering
(k-means and hierarchical).",ababen,2017-03-18 16:57:29

212,2016-10-05 06:12:39,"In a nutshell, what is the purpose of travis? Can it be of some benefit to this repository?
",awelch83,
212,2016-10-07 05:18:59,"Hi! Well, Travis is a CI tool and is usually used to run tests etc on every commit or a PR.
So it _could_ be used to ensure that any pull-requests to this repo follow certain rules. One such example could be that whenever a new PR is submitted, Travis checks that the link is valid (doesn't 404). 

I'd ideally like to have a way to make sure that contributors stick to the correct formatting / alphabetization etc. However, since we aren't quite dealing with structured text, it might be hard to implement this check.

Hope that answers your question.
",prakhar1989,
212,2016-10-07 18:24:22,"Thanks for your reply, Prakhar! I'd like to try to implement this. I figure that I can start first with the 404-check, and then functionality can be expanded from there.

I was also thinking that it might be nice to be able to set up an automated process that would scan all existing URLs at a set interval to check for broken links
",awelch83,
212,2016-10-07 18:59:53,"Sure! Thanks for taking this up! For the 404 checking, you can refer to [Awesome Bot](https://github.com/dkhamsing/awesome_bot). I'd also suggest taking a look at this [PR](https://github.com/prakhar1989/awesome-courses/pull/146) in order to understand the issue we had when we tried to implement it for this repo. I'm sure @awesome-bot would love to chip in.

- Converting legacy C++ projects into relatively easier to understand Python.
- Provides a Linux VM containing necessary dependencies which makes assignments easier to install.
- Adds lectures on convolutional neural networks which are the bomb.com in image recognition now

I can add a link to the VM directly if you would like (it's kind of buried in the first assignment page), but I figured it might break the pattern you have going on here so I left it out of this initial commit.

94,2015-02-10 15:29:11,"@prakhar1989 To answer your concerns from #93, I agree that courses which offer assignments and lectures, in addition to readings, are more useful. I still think, however, that CS 6650 serves a purpose, because this subject matter isn't currently addressed by any other course listed in the readme. In the future, if someone finds a course on this subject that does have assignments to go with it, they will hopefully delete my entry and replace it with their own. Aside from that, I also got rid of the extra bullet point that I somehow created at line 615, in pr #93.

@robbyoconnor I deleted .DS_Store, as you mentioned. I'm not sure why, or how, that file somehow finds its way into my commits from time to time.

Bottomline, they will keep coming back because they are generated automatically by the OS. To avoid that, you should use  `gitignore` files. This [link](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) will help you overcome this issue.

I'm still kind of new to github. If I'm making several changes to a file, as was the case here, is it better to roll them all into a single commit, or to make separate commits for spacing, alphabetization, etc, and then send them in a single pull request?

The (slight) problem in the above PR was that my earlier merge commits were sent again. Ideally, to get the latest set of changes from upstream, try doing `git pull --rebase` instead of a `git pull`. That would have just been one commit instead of 5 which it is showing now.

There was a complaint on the [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8806910) that this page didn't have enough theoretical CS courses listed, so I decided to start one with CIS 500.

It sounds like this PR will preclude adding other courses from Prof. Weiss. However, If you're a newcomer and want to know about operating systems--which I came here looking for--you'd not find Prof. Weiss' courses in this list, and just assume there hadn't been any added. I know I was disappointed to only find the MIT OS course. But now I see Prof. Weiss' OS course that I found only because of this PR.

I believe CSE341 is more or less identical to the [coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/course/proglang) by Dan Grossman from UWash - which is fairly popular by itself. My idea was to keep this repo exclusive to courses which are not popular as a MOOC. What do you think?
",prakhar1989,2014-12-26 07:04:25
7,2014-12-26 06:32:26,"Hmm, this is true. I was debating including it, but went for it because I figured you'd let me know if that was the case :D . That being said, can you still access the course if you weren't in it to begin with? I know some coursera courses turn off non-enrolled students' access a bit after the course has ended. I can't tell if that's the case with 341 (because I was in it) , but if it is it might be worth adding to the repo. 

EDIT: Additionally, I'd suggest making it clearer that any pull requests should be made with directly university-offered courses, not MOOC's off edX or Coursera. I think most people would figure that out anyway, but it doesn't hurt to clarify :smile:
