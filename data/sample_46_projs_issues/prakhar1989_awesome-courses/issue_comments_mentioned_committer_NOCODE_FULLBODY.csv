I just happened to see your repo and checked the build failures on travis so thought it would be nice to have a build status button. :)

Should they be removed?

And there are a bunch that are duplicated.. we can either
1. white list each of them
2. allow duplicates..

Let me know if you'd like me to help correct or if you want to do it yourself

Bottomline, they will keep coming back because they are generated automatically by the OS. To avoid that, you should use  `gitignore` files. This [link](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) will help you overcome this issue.

I still think, however, that CS 6650 serves a purpose, because this subject matter isn't currently addressed by any other course listed in the readme. In the future, if someone finds a course on this subject that does have assignments to go with it, they will hopefully delete my entry and replace it with their own. Aside from that, I also got rid of the extra bullet point that I somehow created at line 615, in pr #93.

@robbyoconnor I deleted .DS_Store, as you mentioned. I'm not sure why, or how, that file somehow finds its way into my commits from time to time.
