562,2017-01-12 02:48:54,"Hey @jeremydubreil thanks for the suggestion I'll do that for now.  My intuition is that Infer does a `==`check on the keys.  This would explain why `float` generated the bug report but `Float` and the hardcoded `1f` doesn't.   i.e. looking just at the keys of the two map.get() calls, these are the three scenarios:





`1f == 1f //true, null check is honored`",cxzhang2,jeremydubreil
559,2017-01-10 18:28:19,"Hi @msridhar.

It is theoretically possible to follow the annotations from the 3rd party libraries. One thing that is not so clear is that different libraries do not necessarily follow the same convention when it comes to `@Nullable`. For example, for analyzed source code, 

is equivalent to:

for Eradicate, meaning that parameter are consider non-nullable by default except when analyzed with `@Nullable` explicitly.

However, your example suggests that we would want to do the opposite assumption for 3rd party libraries when unannotated variables should be considered as `@Nullable` by default except when annotated with `@NonNull`. But this approach would not work for Guava for instance, which uses `@Nullable` more or less as Eradicate expects it. So there should be a way to tell Eradicate, or to detect automatically, which convention is used for each library. 

Or we may want to follow a 3-value logic for libraries and consider no annotation as `unknown` together with `@NonNull` and `@Nullable` ",jeremydubreil,msridhar
559,2017-01-10 18:56:24,"Hi @jeremydubreil yes that's a good point.  My example was contrived; I wanted to keep things simple to make sure I was running the tool correctly.  Probably the right thing to do is to assume usage similar to Guava when annotations from class files are being parsed.  If it's clearly documented, I think that would work well for most cases.  Also, maybe the default should be to behave just as Infer does now (ignoring annotations in class files) to avoid surprises and/or a ton of unwanted false positives.  ",msridhar,jeremydubreil
559,2017-01-10 20:36:23,"@sblackshear, it would actually be easy to load the annotations from the 3rd party library. There is already some support for analyzing the dependencies. For example (changing the example a bit to avoid the issue with `@NonNull` mentioned earlier):


and

We can actually have Eradicate report the issue using the undocumented `--dependencies` options:

The reason why we don't use `--dependencies` by default is to avoid duplication of work when using Buck as the same class. e.g. `java.lang.String` could otherwise be analyzed on many different Buck targets.

The new genrule based approach to integrate Infer with Buck could actually allow use to analyze the third party libraries only once (decorating `prebuilt_jar`) and cache the analysis artifacts, which would contain the annotations as well. cc @kageiit
",jeremydubreil,sblackshear
559,2017-01-13 22:39:58,"@jeremydubreil That sounds like a great idea. As long as infer knows how to extract the analysis artifacts from the `prebuilt_jar` or `prebuilt_android_aar` decorated infer/eradicate genrules, the performance impact will be minimal and the quality of analysis will be a lot greater.

simply change it to let infer_cxx_models = false.

It would be nice, to make it configurable, though. That would make patching `infer` avoidable.

Problem statement :

>  What I am trying to achieve is to run Infer on some files, then re analyse those files after fixing issues. 

First I whitelisted some files on which I want to run infer then,
_I tried all these commands._ 
`infer -- ./gradlew run`  //I was running this each time after fixing my issues It worked but it is taking too much time. 

`infer --reactive -- ./gradlew --offline run` // This gives no issues found each time after first build

`infer --changed-files-index changed_files.txt --reactive -- ./gradlew run` // This gives no issues found. If I don't use --reactive It takes same time as` infer -- ./gradlew run`

I tried 
`-j 16` but It was not of much help because it took same time.

[Here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/checkers/liveness.ml) is a simple checker that you can imitate to get started. This checker computes the set of live variables at each program points, which requires traversing each instruction and expression type in SIL.

Once you've created  a checker that looks like this, you can add it to the checkers to be run in registerCheckers.ml, then run the checkers on code with `infer -a checkers -- <build_cmd>`

For detecting `x % y`, I would do something like this:

428,2016-08-05 10:53:47,"Hello @xennygrimmato,
To use `L.err`/`L.out` you have to be in developer mode, which means you need to invoke infer with the `--developer-mode` argument (as you can see [here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/fe780cb6ffd236cf618c2f9b63b03ddd2de18764/infer/src/backend/logging.ml#L142-L148))

But even if you use that, there may be many different processes running one after the other during the analysis thus overwriting the content of the `analyzer_err` and `analyzer_out` log files, and this should explain why they look empty at the end.

For now, try using `L.stdout`/`L.stderr` to get your output in the console, and you don't need to run in developer mode to use it.

Thanks

427,2016-08-09 11:28:53,"@brotherpaul143 Thanks for your interest in Infer. Perhaps there is some oversight, but as far as we understand Infer does not satisfy the SATE criteria. Infer produces two basic forms of output: 1) specifications of procedures / functions / methods, and 2) issue reports for property violations. Only the inferred specifications are claimed to be sound (subject to some idealistic and optimistic assumptions). Here the notion of sound is that from the logical tradition. In particular, if infer produces {P} f(x) {Q}, then soundness means that execution of f from any state satisfying P does not crash and unless it diverges, the state after f returns satisfies Q. The reports of property violations are produced primarily from failed proofs of such specifications. There is no definition of correctness for these reports, let alone a claim of soundness for them.

What you're interpreting as reluctance is more wariness, and the expectation that the reality of how gray questions of soundness and completeness are for tools like Infer undermines the viability of these sorts of exercises.  In particular, Infer uses both sound techniques and heuristics which are neither sound nor complete.  Additionally, Infer uses the classical logical notion of soundness, which seems to correspond more to what you term completeness.  Infer does not do any reasoning that fits what you term ""soundness"".  The other difficulty is that the logically robust reasoning that Infer does produces specifications that are used internally by Infer, but not directly reported to developers.  Evaluating the correctness of these specifications is nontrivial, since they are hypothetical statements with very involved premisses.
",jberdine,brotherpaul143
427,2016-08-18 10:38:49,"@brotherpaul143 I think a good summary is that Infer comes from sound design principles, makes unsound compromises and heuristics where it makes sense. In particular, Infer tries to maximize the value given to developers, over soundness or completeness concerns.

Now that all the provisos are out of the way, the main question is whether, given these provisos, you think that the results will be useful for SATE V. I guess this is for you to assess.

  Is your copy of the code read-only, or is it possible to change it locally just for testing? Or can you suggest that someone else add the `@Nullable` annotation? This seems like it would be the simplest solution.

It would be quite difficult to change Eradicate to treat all values as potentially nullable, but it should be fairly easy to modify Infer to do this. If you change the code [here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/rearrange.ml#L1144) to

1. select the infer-4.02.3 opam switch: `opam switch infer-4.02.3 && eval $(opam config env)`
2. clone the Reason repo locally, checkout its 0.0.1 release, then `opam pin add -k git reason .` inside the repo should install reason from there

I am interested in detecting common issues that usual common static analyzers (e.g. jshint) do not detect, like undefined methods.

I was curious to understand more how Infer works. Because usually I have had problem using Flow (not so easy to get started with it the way I would like to), and I am still trying to set up Reason (that would be my favorite choice I think).

370,2016-05-26 13:02:03,"Thanks @jvillard for taking a look.
I'm using Infer version v0.8.1

I was able to reproduce it for attached project example.
[InferBugExample.zip](https://github.com/facebook/infer/files/284377/InferBugExample.zip)

I'm running the following command:
`infer -a checkers -a capture -a compile -a infer -a tracing -- xcodebuild -scheme InferBugExample -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator`

By the way, what is the difference between running `infer -- xcodebuild ....` and `infer -a checkers -a capture -a compile -a infer -a tracing -- xcodebuild ....`, does the first command run all available analyzers?
",alexmx,jvillard
370,2016-05-27 11:43:21,"Ok, got it. Thanks @jvillard.

I was confused by the output of help command `infer -h:`
`-a ANALYZER, --analyzer ANALYZER
                        Select the analyzer within: capture, checkers,
                        compile, eradicate, infer, tracing`

So I listed all of them, except eradicate which is for Android projects.

I assume that this issue can be closed as I'm not getting this issue after running:



P.S. I would be cool to be able to merge the results of the analyzers in one final report.

Does it mean I do not need to change anything on the OCaml code? Or in the OCaml code I have to do some changes as well?

353,2016-04-26 04:53:39,"Hi @chen881129. Infer does not parse the xml files, so the information whether `doc.getClassid()` may  return `null` is not known. In this case, Infer will make optimistic assumptions about the code. Here, `docvrid` being dereferenced in `docvrid.equals(...)`, Infer will assumes that `docvrid != null`. If you know that `docvrid` can be null, you can annotate the code accordingly:



And Infer will then make the opposite assumption: `docvrid` will be considered as potentially `null` unless there is enough information to state otherwise. For instance:


",jeremydubreil,chen881129
353,2016-04-26 07:14:54,"Hello @jeremydubreil, very nice to receive your message.
You are right that Infer dose not know `docvrid` is null. Actually `docvrid` is not always null, it's potentially null. So, `docvrid != null && !docvrid.equals(""10000103"")` will be safe and `docvrid.equals(""10000103"")` without `docvrid != null` is dangerous.

In my opinion the dangerous code should be print. Can Infer print the potentially NullPointerException?

345,2016-04-21 12:12:36,"Hi @Rexota, the instructions for docker create an isolated container with infer in it, but it doesn't modify your local environment. When installing infer via docker, you need to perform your analysis from within the docker container. For example, here's how to run a Gradle-based project that builds with `./gradlew build`:



You can edit that last command to adapt to your needs (eg to run `inferTraceBugs` after the analysis: `docker run -v /path/to/gradle/project:/opt/project -it infer /bin/bash -c 'cd /opt/project/ && infer -- ./gradlew clean build && inferTraceBugs'`).

If you need to install more dependencies into the docker image, you can either edit `Dockerfile` or jump inside the image, install whatever you need, then save it again:



Alternatively, you can make infer available in your system (not within docker) by [installing infer from source](http://fbinfer.com/docs/getting-started.html#install-from-source).

344,2016-04-21 10:12:10,"Thanks for the detailed question, @wouter89. What you are seeing is because infer doesn't do a global analysis of a class (in this case `NoNullDereference`) to figure out invariants (in this case ""`alwaysFalse` is always `false`""). To explain, let me try and go over your tests:
1. Infer analyses `test()` on its own (without looking at the context) and finds that it could dereference `null` if `alwaysFalse` is `true`. Since infer doesn't try to analyse the context of the method, only the method itself, it doesn't know that `alwaysFalse` cannot in fact be `true`. The analysis of `main()` shows no error.
2. Same as 1, except this time it turns out that `alwaysTrue` can indeed be `true` to this report turns out to be legit.
3. Infer analyses `test()` and finds no issue. It stores 2 specifications about `test()`: A) when `alwaysTrue` is `true` then the return value is `null`; B) otherwise it is `""hello""`. Infer then analyses `main()`. At the point where `main()` calls `test()`, the value of `nullDereference.alwaysTrue` is `true`, so infer uses specification A and then finds an error when simulating the execution of `null.trim()`.
4. Similar to 3, except than at the point where `main()` calls `test()` infer selects specification B and doesn't find any error when symbolically executing `""hello"".trim()`.
5. Infer analyses `test()` and finds no error because it knows which branch to take in `if (false) ...`.
6. Same as 5 and Infer correctly finds the NPE.

I hope this answers your question. Feel free to open another issue about the general fact that infer doesn't try to find out which fields never change before anaylising the methods in a class.

So, in this last case I don't want to flag `HelloSuper.shouldNotBeStatic` as a potential static method since it is not static so that it can be overridden by a subclass.

I think `Prover.get_overrides_of` will get the job done for my second problem -- Methods that are being overridden by one of their subclasses.

Regarding my first problem -- Methods that are annotated with @ override -- I need to do this because I am having the following false positive. I.e., I am identifying that this method should be static:



I believe that since `android.widget.BaseAdapter` is not in the source code Infer is not able to retrieve it. Would `AndroidFramework.get_all_supertypes` fix this @sblackshear?

I tried it with no luck, but maybe I am doing something wrong. Just wanted to double check this with you.

For the method above, `getFoo()` I have the following representation



I can see that `S_*` probably means a start node, `E_*` an exit node and `I_*` an instruction node. This is pretty similar to what I can get from the dot CFG when I run with checkers enabled:

Both outputs are really cool and really useful.
However, it is still hard for me to create patterns that match SIL based on this.

",jvillard,laalto
286,2016-03-20 20:40:18,"@jvillard -- Sorry for the delay. Appreciate all the activity in this thread.

To analyze my project, I was just using the recommended flow: `infer -- ./gradlew assembleDebug`.

With Retrolambda in the mix, the Android build process is something like:
- Run `javac` over your source files to produce Java 8 bytecode.
- Retrolambda transforms the bytecode to be Java 6/7 compatible.
- `dx` transforms the transformed bytecode into a `.dex` file.

I believe that Infer relies on the `javac` output from the gradle build process (please correct me if I'm mistaken--certainly no expert here), so maybe the issue is that it's using the pre-transformed bytecode.

(I'll try to put together a minimal example.)

Two quick asides, though:
1. It's unclear to me if this is worth fixing right now, since I imagine that a lot will have to change with the introduction of [Jack](http://developer.android.com/preview/j8-jack.html) (already available in the N developer preview), which will make some Java 8 language features standard in Android (backwards compatible to Gingerbread) and will remove the `javac` step from the Android build process.
2. Not relevant to this particular issue, but... it's interesting to me that Infer operates on bytecode, yet it ties in so well with annotations, which (I believe?) are stripped out by the time you get to bytecode (again, please correct me if I'm wrong). Are there any resources around for learning more about how that works?
",crm416,jvillard
286,2016-03-21 14:48:12,"Thanks for the detailed update @crm416. Skipping Java 8 files and not crashing is the expected behaviour, there's a fix in 0.8.0 to reintroduce it.

For infer to be able to analyse code compiled with retrolambda, one of these two things needs to happen:
1. Java 8 support is added to Infer (#314)
2. Support for starting from the bytecode instead of from the Java source is added to Infer (#308)

1 is planned, and there's nothing stopping 2 in principle, since our Java frontend already starts from Java bytecode (only some rearchitecturing is needed to be able to not start from the sources).

I'm closing this issue since it's been resolved. Use the other two issues to track progress on the larger issue of dealing with Java8 bytecode.

This is not a theoretical limitation but it will require a good amount of changes to support this use case. Is it possible in your setting to just make a copy of `infer-out` after `infer -a capture` and before running the analysis ?

Besides, I think that the `-i` option is not compatible with running the analysis in two steps using:

  `infer -a capture --`

followed by:

  `infer -- analyze`

Is the approach or running:

  `infer -i -a eradicate -o eradicate-out -- ...`

  `infer -i -a infer -o infer-out -- ...`

If I understand correctly, you get the same error running `xcodebuild -target myTarget -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator`. This means that this is not the right command to build your project. You first need to figure out how to compile your project from the command line. Then use `infer -- <your command here>` to run infer.

The idea here was that `./build-infer.sh` would tell you what to do in this situation: if the opam packages are missing, it fails with the following message:



Perhaps the last two commands can be added to the document instead of your opam command? The (small) advantage is that this is guaranteed to remain in sync with the [opam file](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/45813c3/opam). Also, please add the same commands to the MacOS instructions.

About Eclipse, there's no plugin to run Infer from the UI, but you can still run Infer on your source code through the command-line. If your project builds with gradle, and the task to build it is `build`, then you can simply run the following command:

162,2015-08-19 08:52:36,"Hi @b0207191,

You probably don't need to use dest-$CC to compile infer and the facebook-clang-plugins. (The error you get is because your dest-$CC is indeed too old)

The Makefile you pasted does not seem to contain any build rules, it just calls other Makefiles. To be able to help, it would be great to see an example invocation of the compiler as called by your Makefiles.

One possibility for your issue is if your Makefile gives several source files to $CC at once. Infer cannot deal with this. For instance, `infer -- gcc -c a.c b.c` does not work. Instead, one should use `infer -- gcc -c a.c && infer -- gcc -c b.c`. I realise now that we seem to have forgotten to document this!

109,2015-06-26 11:52:28,"@Debhora you said analyzing whole project was too slow for you and hence you want to analyze one file only.
Was it too slow when using incremental build (infer --incremental -- BUILD_CMD)? It might solve all your problems without getting deep into compiling single file via very long command line.

Note: you shouldn't clean build in between runs.

As @jvillard said, `NSUserDefaults+App.h` doesn't look like a system header, so I'd proceed as he suggested, by passing to Clang the path where this file lives, using the `-I` argument.

More in general, when `xcodebuild` builds each file of your codebase, it passes to Clang more arguments than just the source filename, and among those there's the `-isysroot` one, which tells Clang where your SDK lives.
For example, your iPhoneSimulator SDK should be located in:



try passing `-isysroot <SDK_PATH>` to your Clang command.

This means that Infer didn't find any file to analyse in your project. You should run Infer on a cleaned version of your project. Try running something like this before running Infer:



(adapt this command to your own project)

> IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: u'/Users/Priyanka/Documents/XXXX/Local/XXXX/trunk/infer-out/report.json'

You are getting this error because the Infer result directory (`infer-out`) doesn't exist, because Infer didn't find anything to analyse.

Follow the guide and try running `xcodebuild` with the correct set of arguments first, then as soon as you find the right configuration, try using `infer --` with it.

If you still have problems, please paste here, if you can, the `xcodebuild` command you are using and information that can help troubleshooting, like the output of the command.

--- 

### Generate a json compilation database
If you add the [following parameter](http://oclint-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/xctool.html#running-xctool-with-json-compilation-database-reporter) to 
* `xctool`: `-reporter json-compilation-database:compile_commands.json` 
* `xcpretty`:  `-r json-compilation-database -o compile_commands.json`

#### This'll enable you to use one of the following commands: 
Depending on how you generate this file you use one of the following options:
*  `xcpretty` and `xctool`: `--clang-compilation-db-files-escaped` 
    * reason: the files in the json are escaped : 'file\\ with\\ spaces'
* `cmake`: `--clang-compilation-db-files`

Granted, it'd be a 2 step process, but it'll work 👍 

**NB** Commonly, the build output will be stored in a file called 'xcodebuild.log'. If you need a different reporter for e.g. your test, you can still do that, generate the `compile_commands.json` using that log file, and launch infer using that generated `compile_commands.json`

Concretely:
1. `xctool.sh --<whatever parameters you need> -reporter json-compilation-database:compile_commands.json` or `xcodebuild --<whatever parameters> | tee xcodebuild.log | xcpretty -r junit -o junit.xml` as usual
2. `cat xcodebuild.log | xcpretty -r json-compilation-database -o compile_commands.json &> /dev/null`
    * the last part pipes the output  to `/dev/null`, as otherwise it'd be displayed on screen again, convoluting your build log.
3. `infer --skip-analysis-in-path Pods --clang-compilation-db-files-escaped compile_commands.json`

Where should the index.txt file should reside?
I followed two steps:

`infer -a capture -- ./gradlew --offline assLollipopDeb`
`infer --reactive --changed-files-index ./index.txt -- analyze`

I know there are two issues in the file which i given in index.txt. But its not working. I tried giving both relative path and absolute path of the file in index.txt. I placed index.txt inside infer-out.

It will spend more time on procedures before giving up. That often translates into more precision but your mileage may vary.

Please look in the following example.

@Nullable
public String name;

public static boolean notEmpty(@Nullable String string) {
    return !isEmpty(string);
}

public static boolean isEmpty(@Nullable CharSequence str) {
        if (str == null || str.length() == 0)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
}

**My piece of code is**,

public void checkString()
{
   if (notEmpty(name) && name.equals(""SomeConstants"")) 
   {
   //do something
   }
}

**Now the problem.!!**

Eradicate throws a issue that, in checkString() method, name could be null and NPE will happen in .equals(""SomeConstants""). But if you look at notEmpty(name) is already having null check. 

So, why eradicate is not understanding the flow of code and what will be the best solution for this??

Any help is appreciated.",mohammedsafiq,Nullable
573,2017-02-02 09:12:42,"Hi @mohammedsafiq, Eradicate works pretty much like a type checker, where a value annotated @Nullable is considered as always being potentially null, so local checks for null are required.
In particular, Eradicate does not try to understand the flow of values in a method call, such as `notEmpty(name)`. Another way to look at this: it only considers information at method boundaries, so it will give the same result for any implementation of `notEmpty`, including the one which always returns `true`.

566,2017-01-23 21:47:30,"Are `filename1` and `filename2` relative paths to the files from the project root? If you are running Eradicate from `myproject/` and `filename1` is at `myproject/src/com/my/project/filename1`, .inferconfig would expect `src/com/my/project/filename` in `eradicate_blacklist`.

In addition, note that the blacklist does not actually stop Eradicate from running on those files altogether; it just stops Eradicate from reporting any errors on those files. If there are other files that call `@Nullable` methods from `filename1` (directly, or transitively), those errors will still be reported.  ",sblackshear,Nullable
559,2017-01-10 05:07:06,"Not sure if this is a bug or a missing feature (or neither).  I have two source files as input.  

T1.java:

T2.java:

I have infer installed from Homebrew, version 0.9.4.  If I run javac on T2.java with Eradicate, I get the expected result:

However, if I first compile T1.java with javac **without** running Eradicate, and then run javac on T2.java with Eradicate, I get no error:

Hence it seems that Eradicate is not reading the `@NonNull` annotation from the T1.class file.  If this is in fact a missing feature and not a bug, I think it'd be a very useful addition for Eradicate to be able to leverage annotations in extant class files.

559,2017-01-10 18:28:19,"Hi @msridhar.

It is theoretically possible to follow the annotations from the 3rd party libraries. One thing that is not so clear is that different libraries do not necessarily follow the same convention when it comes to `@Nullable`. For example, for analyzed source code, 

is equivalent to:

for Eradicate, meaning that parameter are consider non-nullable by default except when analyzed with `@Nullable` explicitly.

However, your example suggests that we would want to do the opposite assumption for 3rd party libraries when unannotated variables should be considered as `@Nullable` by default except when annotated with `@NonNull`. But this approach would not work for Guava for instance, which uses `@Nullable` more or less as Eradicate expects it. So there should be a way to tell Eradicate, or to detect automatically, which convention is used for each library. 

Or we may want to follow a 3-value logic for libraries and consider no annotation as `unknown` together with `@NonNull` and `@Nullable` ",jeremydubreil,Nullable

  We don't currently have any special support for JUnit annotations like `@Test`, but we could add support if there is a need.

In general, I'm skeptical of the utility of statically analyzing small pieces of test code like your example (since one can always just run the code and let JUnit check if the right thing happens). But I'm intrigued by the possibility of using JUnit assertions to specify statically checkable contracts in non-test code.

I get a warning no matter what argument I actually send to D.f. I'd like to get a warning only if I call with the argument being `true`. The `null` trick you suggest is actually what I was trying before @ddino showed me that `while(true){}` does what I want. But it stopped working in the meantime ...

492,2016-11-05 16:56:55,"Thanks, that does indeed clear things up!

I think that the triple you want is what can/will inferred for the on-paper version of the bi-abduction algorithm, but the Infer implementation chooses to report a warning in this case for pragmatic reasons (assuming that all branches are reachable in some context lets us report more bugs without causing too many false positives). 

If I'm right about this, I'm not immediately sure how to talk Infer into doing what you want. Let me think about it a bit more.

(Copying @cristianoc and @ddino since they have better knowledge about how the theory and practice diverge here.)

This used to give a warning on line marked with HERE. It stopped giving a warning at commit 3fb8801b6c8672ad0b7819aeda74d1feb4325be7 (by @cristianoc).

In any case, even if the parent commit gives a warning on T3@HERE (which I want!), it does not give a warning on the following:



I don't understand why. I'm rather confused at this point. (**Edit**: Oh, it's perhaps because `G.go_call` has some specs, while `T2.f` doesn't.)

From the comments, with the mention of e.g. ""which variable is symbolic"", it seems that @zzy assumes that infer operates in a way similar to King-style symbolic execution.  I don't think that trying to understand what infer does in these terms is useful, since what it actually does is very different.  A better starting point is probably http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2049697.2049700.

@jeremydubreil I got it close to a point where it can be finished up to merge. Im no ocaml expert and just based my code off the other existing ones.

Please let me know if something is completely off and what I should do to fix the last few compiler errors.

This will let us exclude entire paths like `buck-out/annotation` which contain all generated code and greatly improve infer run speeds

It should not have been.

Here is one additional requirements that could improve the checker:
- in order to identify a property as delegate, besides containing ""delegate"" in the name also require the usage of a protocol in the type.
- In this case it it also obvious, that a class from the Foundation framework does not play the role of a delegate - but since those classes can always implement a protocol via a class extension, this might not be a good thing to check.

Allowing such option may lead to maintenance problems - we are assuming a lot under the hood which means that `my_great_custom_script` needs to work exactly as `buck`.

423,2016-08-03 14:36:27,"Strictly speaking, it's true that the code will not generate an NPE. That said, the choice Infer makes is to report anyway. If a project deliberately catches `NullPointerException`, Infer will produce a lot of unintended reports. For such projects (if they exist), a different message would help.

I suspect that it would be hard to implement that behaviour in infer: if `foo()` dereferences null, then infer will want to report on `foo()`. But maybe `foo()` is only called from inside `bar()`, which catches `Exception` or `NullPointerException`. Currently, infer has no way to know every context in which `foo()` is called prior to analysing `foo()`, so it would be hard to avoid reporting on `foo()`.

That said, as @martinoluca was saying in #422, such code patterns are dubious at best anyway.

410,2016-07-31 13:28:37,"@hzsweers great suggestion.
What specific use cases do you have in mind?
For example, some time ago we added `@TrueOnNull` https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/97bc95e8c920196d91a9d48cb4ac93f6c43b8187/infer/tests/codetoanalyze/java/eradicate/NullMethodCall.java#L248 to support boolean functions on objects that return `true` when the object is `null`. They can then be used as in https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/97bc95e8c920196d91a9d48cb4ac93f6c43b8187/infer/tests/codetoanalyze/java/eradicate/NullMethodCall.java#L261.
",cristianoc,TrueOnNull
410,2016-07-31 22:42:32,"It would be great to support them in general as they give a lot of contextual information about how a method handles inputs. The example in there about a method that only returns `null` if the input parameter is `null` is a great example. Being able to express other conditions in that format would be great too. Being able to mark methods as throwing on certain conditions would be immense as well.

Looking at the page again, I think it would be great to support `@ParametersAreNonnullByDefault` annotation as well, as it also looks pretty useful.

401,2016-07-22 03:30:56,"@jvillard, sorry for that I can't use company code to repro this.
And my demo maven project seems not get the repro.
However, in my company project, there will generate file like META-INF/MANIFEST.MF in some place which will be javac-ed in python cmd array, or your can nested some kind of file with other extension type in src.

I still paste the demo by following your advise, see if it's helpful.

397,2016-07-20 10:17:00,"Can you provide a full minimal example that reproduces your issue? Shooting from the hip, you could add a `@Nullable` annotation to the return of your getter method so that Infer assumes it can return null.

More (speculative) details: When Infer doesn't know about a function for whatever reason (no implementation available, or Infer failed to analyse it), Infer will treat that function ""angelically"" and assume that eg it never returns null. This is done to prevent being too noisy. This may or may not be what's happening in your case, we'd need to see some code to know for sure.
",jvillard,Nullable
383,2016-06-15 07:39:08,"@chen881129 I guess you're using eradicate mode with `-a eradicate`.
Is the return type of `getClassid()` annotated `@Nullable`?
",cristianoc,Nullable
383,2016-06-15 08:38:59,"@cristianoc . Yeah, I used eradicate mode.
There is no error about `getClassid() may return null but it is not annotated with @Nullable` in the bug.txt.
",chen881129,Nullable
383,2016-06-15 08:43:32,"@chen881129 you should annotate `getClassid()` in your source code, e.g.
`@Nullable String getClassid() { ... }`
",cristianoc,Nullable
383,2016-06-15 10:06:48,"@cristianoc In fact, I'm QA, I can't modify the code...
Thank you very much. I've seen the doc of Infer ""What is the @Nullable convention?If you say nothing, you’re saying that the value **cannot be null**.""

Can I modify the code of Infer to the opposite--""If you say nothing, you’re saying that the value **can be null**.""?
",chen881129,Nullable
383,2016-07-06 16:14:31,"@chen881129,
  Is your copy of the code read-only, or is it possible to change it locally just for testing? Or can you suggest that someone else add the `@Nullable` annotation? This seems like it would be the simplest solution.

It would be quite difficult to change Eradicate to treat all values as potentially nullable, but it should be fairly easy to modify Infer to do this. If you change the code [here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/rearrange.ml#L1144) to 



and delete lines 1145-1184, Infer should warn on ever deref unless it can prove the value being dereferenced is non-null.

You can remove error filtering by running with the `--no-filtering` option (see `infer --help`).

We're working on improving the array bounds analysis.

where `obj` is not being dereference without a check for `null` inside the body of `Controler`. If that was the case, then the NPE would be reported in the body of `Controler`, not when calling the constructor with `null` somewhere else.

Would you be able to reproduce the issue on a small toy example ?

In this checker I am getting two kinds of false positives:
- **Methods that are annotated with @override** -- although I am checking whether a given method is overriding any method in one of its superclasses, this is not enough.
- **Methods that are being overridden by one of their subclasses** -- these methods cannot be converted to static.

For the first false positive I think I am getting close but if you could give me some hints it would be really helpful.

For the second, I have no clue... :worried:

**Butter Knife 6** and before: `@InjectView` would cause a runtime exception if the view was null after binding. Could optionally add `@Optional` if you wanted to allow for nulls. Behavior applies to fields and methods.



**Butter Knife 7**: `@Bind` was the same as `@InjectView` functionally, but `@Optional` was removed in favor of reusing `@Nullable` so the IDE would lint it. Same idea though. Behavior applies to fields and methods.



**Butter Knife 8+**: Unreleased, but behavior will be the same with fields. For methods however, `@Optional` was re-added because it was strange to require `@Nullable` for methods since many had `void` return types. Note that it's only allowed on methods however, fields must still use `@Nullable`

Adding this fixed it...not sure why the JVM didn't just cleanly exit but apparently the openJDK JVM does this :-P

255,2016-01-29 23:58:13,"It seems like Infer does not keep separate caches for different analyzers. This can result in surprising empty analysis runs (unless I'm doing something wrong).

I'm testing with this Java file:



It should generate 0 Infer warnings and 1 Erradicate warning (because of a missing `@Nullable`).

If I run Infer with `-i -a infer` first, and then `-i -a eradicate`, it will assume there is nothing to analyze for Eradicate and incorrectly report no warnings:



If I run Eradicate first, it properly finds the missing annotations:

243,2016-01-24 06:01:44,"I found this from the following documentation.
http://fbinfer.com/docs/infer-bug-types.html#RETAIN_CYCLE

The Retain Cycle is described as follows.

@class Child;
@interface Parent : NSObject {
    Child *child;
}
@end
@interface Child : NSObject {
    __weak Parent *parent;
}
@end

But I think, this is valid if ""Child"" is a subclass of ""Parent"". Here both Child and Parent are inherited from NSObject class and hence are independent. 
I think the documentation should be corrected as follows.

@class Child;
@interface Parent : NSObject {
    Child *child;

@interface Child : Parent {

  Warning: you are not using a release of Infer. The C and
  Objective-C analyses require a custom clang to be compiled
  now. This step takes ~30-60 minutes, possibly more.

  To speed this along, you are encouraged to use a release of
  Infer instead:

  http://fbinfer.com/docs/getting-started.html

  If you are only interested in analyzing Java programs, simply
  run this script with only the ""java"" argument:

  ./build-infer.sh java

Are you sure you want to compile clang? (y/N) y

I will investigate this issue and give you updates!
In the meanwhile, could you please send me a paste of the real error? What you provided is just a summary of the errors that happened during the build. The real message should be a bit above that line.

I test infer for detecting retain cycle with simple exsample:

In ViewController.m:

@property (strong, nonatomic) TestView *testView;

self.testView = [TestView new];
self.testView.controller = self;

In TestView.m

@property (strong, nonatomic) ViewController *controller;

Run infer and give me some other issue but no Retain Cycle warning.

I have followed the instructions in the docs for infer, and installed infer. In oder to analyse the app i have used the following command:

infer --incremental -- xcodebuild -target xyz -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator 

Initially i was getting the @import error in #2 , but now the error is different as described in the screenshot attached. Bt when the app is built in Xcode, the app works fine on simulator and device.

I have the xcworkspace of ""xyz"" app as pods also is added to the project. Please let me know if there is any other command that can be used to analyse xcworkspace.

Subject: [infer] iOS app build fails when using infer (#39)

When I build my app like this it succeeds: xcodebuild -workspace ""foo"" -scheme ""bar"" -configuration ""baz"" -sdk ""iphonesimulator""

However when I use it with infer, I get a compilation error.

infer -- xcodebuild -workspace ""foo"" -scheme ""bar"" -configuration ""baz"" -sdk ""iphonesimulator"" gives me:

error: use of
      '@import' when modules are disabled
@import UIKit;

Does infer affect the build process?

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
@interface A : NSObject
@end 
@implementation A
-(void) test {
  NSMutableString *s = CFBridgingRelease(CFStringCreateMutableCopy(NULL, 0, CFSTR(""foo"")));
}
@end

Could you give me more context about how you called Infer? 
Thanks,
Dulma

I'm getting the same error. Any news when it will be fixed?
