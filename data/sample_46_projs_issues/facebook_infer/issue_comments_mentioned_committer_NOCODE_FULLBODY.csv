It will spend more time on procedures before giving up. That often translates into more precision but your mileage may vary.

This would explain why `float` generated the bug report but `Float` and the hardcoded `1f` doesn't.   i.e. looking just at the keys of the two map.get() calls, these are the three scenarios:

559,2017-01-10 18:56:24,"Hi @jeremydubreil yes that's a good point.  My example was contrived; I wanted to keep things simple to make sure I was running the tool correctly.  Probably the right thing to do is to assume usage similar to Guava when annotations from class files are being parsed.  If it's clearly documented, I think that would work well for most cases.  Also, maybe the default should be to behave just as Infer does now (ignoring annotations in class files) to avoid surprises and/or a ton of unwanted false positives.  ",msridhar,jeremydubreil
559,2017-01-10 20:36:23,"@sblackshear, it would actually be easy to load the annotations from the 3rd party library. There is already some support for analyzing the dependencies. For example (changing the example a bit to avoid the issue with `@NonNull` mentioned earlier):


and

We can actually have Eradicate report the issue using the undocumented `--dependencies` options:

The reason why we don't use `--dependencies` by default is to avoid duplication of work when using Buck as the same class. e.g. `java.lang.String` could otherwise be analyzed on many different Buck targets.

The new genrule based approach to integrate Infer with Buck could actually allow use to analyze the third party libraries only once (decorating `prebuilt_jar`) and cache the analysis artifacts, which would contain the annotations as well. cc @kageiit
",jeremydubreil,sblackshear
559,2017-01-13 22:39:58,"@jeremydubreil That sounds like a great idea. As long as infer knows how to extract the analysis artifacts from the `prebuilt_jar` or `prebuilt_android_aar` decorated infer/eradicate genrules, the performance impact will be minimal and the quality of analysis will be a lot greater. Seems like that is the best approach forward.",kageiit,jeremydubreil

     . /home/dalei/.opam/opam-init/init.zsh > /dev/null 2> /dev/null || true
3. To avoid issues related to non-system installations of `ocamlfind`
   add the following lines to ~/.ocamlinit (create it if necessary):
   
     let () =
       try Topdirs.dir_directory (Sys.getenv ""OCAML_TOPLEVEL_PATH"")
       with Not_found -> ()
     ;;

There's value, in the README, to explain what the concepts and parts are: there's a call graph, there's a control-flow graph, perhaps what their main function is, big picture kind of description.

[Here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/checkers/liveness.ml) is a simple checker that you can imitate to get started. This checker computes the set of live variables at each program points, which requires traversing each instruction and expression type in SIL.

Once you've created  a checker that looks like this, you can add it to the checkers to be run in registerCheckers.ml, then run the checkers on code with `infer -a checkers -- <build_cmd>`

For detecting `x % y`, I would do something like this: 



To get started, I would replace calls to `exp_get_live` in the checker above with calls to this function.
",sblackshear,xennygrimmato
428,2016-08-05 10:53:47,"Hello @xennygrimmato,
To use `L.err`/`L.out` you have to be in developer mode, which means you need to invoke infer with the `--developer-mode` argument (as you can see [here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/fe780cb6ffd236cf618c2f9b63b03ddd2de18764/infer/src/backend/logging.ml#L142-L148))

But even if you use that, there may be many different processes running one after the other during the analysis thus overwriting the content of the `analyzer_err` and `analyzer_out` log files, and this should explain why they look empty at the end.

For now, try using `L.stdout`/`L.stderr` to get your output in the console, and you don't need to run in developer mode to use it.

Thanks

427,2016-08-16 12:34:39,"@brotherpaul143 it seems that Infer and SATE use two opposite definitions of correct/sound. From your website:

""1. The tool is claimed to be sound.""

and

""Sound means every finding is correct. The tool need not produce a finding for every site; that is completeness.""

This is simply not the case for Infer: reports made by Infer may not correspond to an actual weakness in the code.

Note that Infer is sound in the logical sense, which seems to correspond to your notion of ""completeness"": if Infer doesn't report on a procedure, then that procedure has no bugs (as @jberdine said, ""subject to some idealistic and optimistic assumptions""). Infer reports a bug when it fails to prove that a procedure has no bugs (and when Infer's internal heuristics suggest that it may correspond to a real issue, otherwise Infer would be too noisy), not when it can prove that a procedure definitely has a bug.

How can I exclude this particular dead code checker when running `infer -a checkers ...` command?

372,2016-05-27 08:21:41,"@jeremydubreil thanks for your answer.

I am interested in detecting common issues that usual common static analyzers (e.g. jshint) do not detect, like undefined methods.

I was curious to understand more how Infer works. Because usually I have had problem using Flow (not so easy to get started with it the way I would like to), and I am still trying to set up Reason (that would be my favorite choice I think).

370,2016-05-26 13:02:03,"Thanks @jvillard for taking a look.
I'm using Infer version v0.8.1

I was able to reproduce it for attached project example.
[InferBugExample.zip](https://github.com/facebook/infer/files/284377/InferBugExample.zip)

I'm running the following command:
`infer -a checkers -a capture -a compile -a infer -a tracing -- xcodebuild -scheme InferBugExample -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator`

By the way, what is the difference between running `infer -- xcodebuild ....` and `infer -a checkers -a capture -a compile -a infer -a tracing -- xcodebuild ....`, does the first command run all available analyzers?
",alexmx,jvillard
370,2016-05-27 11:43:21,"Ok, got it. Thanks @jvillard.

I was confused by the output of help command `infer -h:`
`-a ANALYZER, --analyzer ANALYZER
                        Select the analyzer within: capture, checkers,
                        compile, eradicate, infer, tracing`

So I listed all of them, except eradicate which is for Android projects.

I assume that this issue can be closed as I'm not getting this issue after running:



P.S. I would be cool to be able to merge the results of the analyzers in one final report.

367,2016-05-27 03:14:54,"@sblackshear Thank you very much for your reply! Just one clarification for 

> Once you add these annotations, Infer will report source-sink flows between the annotations.

Does it mean I do not need to change anything on the OCaml code? Or in the OCaml code I have to do some changes as well?

Right now I am trying to implement a checker that will detect the tainted variables that was brought over from one function to another function.
",jmtiong,sblackshear
353,2016-04-26 07:14:54,"Hello @jeremydubreil, very nice to receive your message.
You are right that Infer dose not know `docvrid` is null. Actually `docvrid` is not always null, it's potentially null. So, `docvrid != null && !docvrid.equals(""10000103"")` will be safe and `docvrid.equals(""10000103"")` without `docvrid != null` is dangerous.

In my opinion the dangerous code should be print. Can Infer print the potentially NullPointerException?

I think `Prover.get_overrides_of` will get the job done for my second problem -- Methods that are being overridden by one of their subclasses.

Regarding my first problem -- Methods that are annotated with @ override -- I need to do this because I am having the following false positive. I.e., I am identifying that this method should be static:



I believe that since `android.widget.BaseAdapter` is not in the source code Infer is not able to retrieve it. Would `AndroidFramework.get_all_supertypes` fix this @sblackshear?

For the method above, `getFoo()` I have the following representation



I can see that `S_*` probably means a start node, `E_*` an exit node and `I_*` an instruction node. This is pretty similar to what I can get from the dot CFG when I run with checkers enabled:

Both outputs are really cool and really useful.
However, it is still hard for me to create patterns that match SIL based on this.

Example:
The following pattern matches with one of the instructions of node Procdesc `int Hello.getFoo()`



However, every time I want to create a new pattern I am blindly trying to guess these things.

",laalto,jvillard
286,2016-03-20 20:40:18,"@jvillard -- Sorry for the delay. Appreciate all the activity in this thread.

To analyze my project, I was just using the recommended flow: `infer -- ./gradlew assembleDebug`.

With Retrolambda in the mix, the Android build process is something like:
- Run `javac` over your source files to produce Java 8 bytecode.
- Retrolambda transforms the bytecode to be Java 6/7 compatible.
- `dx` transforms the transformed bytecode into a `.dex` file.

I believe that Infer relies on the `javac` output from the gradle build process (please correct me if I'm mistaken--certainly no expert here), so maybe the issue is that it's using the pre-transformed bytecode.

(I'll try to put together a minimal example.)

Two quick asides, though:
1. It's unclear to me if this is worth fixing right now, since I imagine that a lot will have to change with the introduction of [Jack](http://developer.android.com/preview/j8-jack.html) (already available in the N developer preview), which will make some Java 8 language features standard in Android (backwards compatible to Gingerbread) and will remove the `javac` step from the Android build process.
2. Not relevant to this particular issue, but... it's interesting to me that Infer operates on bytecode, yet it ties in so well with annotations, which (I believe?) are stripped out by the time you get to bytecode (again, please correct me if I'm wrong). Are there any resources around for learning more about how that works?

This is not a theoretical limitation but it will require a good amount of changes to support this use case. Is it possible in your setting to just make a copy of `infer-out` after `infer -a capture` and before running the analysis ?

Besides, I think that the `-i` option is not compatible with running the analysis in two steps using:

  `infer -a capture --`

followed by:

  `infer -- analyze`

Is the approach or running:

  `infer -i -a eradicate -o eradicate-out -- ...`

and independently:

  `infer -i -a infer -o infer-out -- ...`

blocking for you ?

As I already said my main app is using 2 android app as library and 1 java library. All are at different different locations.
So while running ""infer -- ./gradlew build"" , I was getting error related to project root.
So After code checkout I moved out all library code inside my main app and updated path in settings.gradle
After that I ran ""./gradlew clean"" command to build the project and then ran infer command.

It took more than 2 hours after that I saw the log ""starting analyzing git....."" and to analyze full codebase and creating bugs.txt it took around 3:30 hrs to 4 hrs.

I cannot share the source code as it is confidential.

I run this command ""eval ./opam config env"" as per setup steps but I got below error:

The program 'opam' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt-get install opam

So I did sudo apt-get install opam, it installed opam but after running command ""eval ./opam config env"" again I got below error:

[ERROR] Your version of OPAM (1.1.1) is not recent enough to read ~/.opam/config. Upgrade OPAM to a more recent version (at least 1.2) to read this file correctly.
'opam config env' failed.

# opam-version    1.1.1

# os              linux

File /home/user/.opam/config: Bad format! opam-version

After that I run this command, ./opam install -y extlib.1.5.4 atdgen.1.6.0 javalib.2.3.1 sawja.1.5.1

It installed all four dependencies
[NOTE] Package extlib is already installed (current version is 1.5.4).

[NOTE] Package javalib is already installed (current version is 2.3.1).

thanks for your suggestion, i have still two questions
first.   how infer change the PATH environment variable, i echo the $PATH and found it is appended the cross-compile tool directory, is it enough

echo $PATH

second.   there is no 'configure' step in the project, can i know how many environment variables infer need to use, so that i can check if they are useful?  i don't know how infer capture the process of compile.

162,2015-08-20 01:05:23,"@jvillard 
yes,the project do the compile by call 'makefile' in every directory Recursively 

one 'makefile' look like this:

include $(top_srcdir)/Rules.mk

LIB_CLI_VER := 1.0.0
DLIB_FLAGS = -fPIC -shared -lpthread -lrt
TAG := xxx.so
ELF := $(TAG).$(LIB_CLI_VER)
SRC := $(shell find -name '_.c')
DEPEND = $(shell find -name '_.d')
OBJ = file1.o   file2.o .... filen.o

%.o: %.c
    $(CC) -c -fPIC $(CFLAGS) -Wall $< -o $@

.PHONY: build install clean
all: build install

build: $(TAG)
$(TAG): $(OBJ)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(DLIB_FLAGS) $^ $(IMAGES)/lib/fsui.a -o $(ELF)

install:
    mkdir -p $(install_sodir)
    cp -p $(ELF) $(install_sodir)
    cd $(install_sodir) && ln -sf $(ELF) $(TAG)

clean:
    rm -rf  $(OBJ) $(ELF) $(DEPEND)

include $(SRC:.c=.d)

%.d: %.c
    set -e; rm -f $@; \
    $(CC) -M -MT $_.o $(CFLAGS) $< > $@.$$$$; \
    sed 's,($_).o[ :]*,\1.o $@ : ,g' < $@.$$$$ > $@; \

i think gcc in the makefile execute as 'gcc -c file1.c gcc -c file2.c', but not 'gcc -c file1.c file2.c'??

well, although i can try 'infer -- make CC=clang xxx', i haven't all the codes in the project, the code of mine need to link other .so(dynamic library) of other components , so the log occur in linking parse:

thank you for advise all above. 
i made a try under 32bit-ubuntu enviroment and had successfully to run infer the project inspite there are most false positive in result.

by the way, can infer now only detect null pointer reference and memory(resouce) leak ?
i think since its working manner is similiar to coverity, it should discover many bugs in the future.

- I want to spin up a VPS for CI that can run infer & act as a git remote. Building this on docker, makes it portable and sharable.

107,2015-07-08 11:02:01,"Hello @emkou,
As @jvillard said, `NSUserDefaults+App.h` doesn't look like a system header, so I'd proceed as he suggested, by passing to Clang the path where this file lives, using the `-I` argument.

More in general, when `xcodebuild` builds each file of your codebase, it passes to Clang more arguments than just the source filename, and among those there's the `-isysroot` one, which tells Clang where your SDK lives.
For example, your iPhoneSimulator SDK should be located in:



try passing `-isysroot <SDK_PATH>` to your Clang command.

The build works fine without infer --.  Someone from Realm told me that Infer doesn't support C++ and Obj-C++ yet, so that might be the case, since Infer recompiles the workspace again and couldn't recompile Realm code?

### Generate a json compilation database
If you add the [following parameter](http://oclint-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/xctool.html#running-xctool-with-json-compilation-database-reporter) to 
* `xctool`: `-reporter json-compilation-database:compile_commands.json` 
* `xcpretty`:  `-r json-compilation-database -o compile_commands.json`

#### This'll enable you to use one of the following commands: 
Depending on how you generate this file you use one of the following options:
*  `xcpretty` and `xctool`: `--clang-compilation-db-files-escaped` 
    * reason: the files in the json are escaped : 'file\\ with\\ spaces'
* `cmake`: `--clang-compilation-db-files`

Granted, it'd be a 2 step process, but it'll work 👍 

**NB** Commonly, the build output will be stored in a file called 'xcodebuild.log'. If you need a different reporter for e.g. your test, you can still do that, generate the `compile_commands.json` using that log file, and launch infer using that generated `compile_commands.json`

Concretely:
1. `xctool.sh --<whatever parameters you need> -reporter json-compilation-database:compile_commands.json` or `xcodebuild --<whatever parameters> | tee xcodebuild.log | xcpretty -r junit -o junit.xml` as usual
2. `cat xcodebuild.log | xcpretty -r json-compilation-database -o compile_commands.json &> /dev/null`
    * the last part pipes the output  to `/dev/null`, as otherwise it'd be displayed on screen again, convoluting your build log.
3. `infer --skip-analysis-in-path Pods --clang-compilation-db-files-escaped compile_commands.json`

Where should the index.txt file should reside?
I followed two steps:

`infer -a capture -- ./gradlew --offline assLollipopDeb`
`infer --reactive --changed-files-index ./index.txt -- analyze`

I know there are two issues in the file which i given in index.txt. But its not working. I tried giving both relative path and absolute path of the file in index.txt. I placed index.txt inside infer-out.

Still the proc_stats_json contains:

It will spend more time on procedures before giving up. That often translates into more precision but your mileage may vary.

We can actually have Eradicate report the issue using the undocumented `--dependencies` options:

The reason why we don't use `--dependencies` by default is to avoid duplication of work when using Buck as the same class. e.g. `java.lang.String` could otherwise be analyzed on many different Buck targets.

The new genrule based approach to integrate Infer with Buck could actually allow use to analyze the third party libraries only once (decorating `prebuilt_jar`) and cache the analysis artifacts, which would contain the annotations as well. cc @kageiit

If a project deliberately catches `NullPointerException`, Infer will produce a lot of unintended reports. For such projects (if they exist), a different message would help.

I suspect that it would be hard to implement that behaviour in infer: if `foo()` dereferences null, then infer will want to report on `foo()`. But maybe `foo()` is only called from inside `bar()`, which catches `Exception` or `NullPointerException`. Currently, infer has no way to know every context in which `foo()` is called prior to analysing `foo()`, so it would be hard to avoid reporting on `foo()`.

This Checker is based on Checkers.callback_print_c_method_calls and prints every Java method call.

Note: for my convenience I have added `oUnit-all.cache` to `.gitinore`.

Is there anywhere else where we check the version of the installed OCaml compiler ?
