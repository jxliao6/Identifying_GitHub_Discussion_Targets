I've been digging through the repository and reading the docs to try to understand how to best build new checking capabilities. Are there any particularly good commits or PRs that demonstrate how to properly add a new feature to Infer?

629,2017-03-21 17:59:17,"Hi Jacob,
  Infer already supports detecting some of these bug types (e.g., [`Context`](http://fbinfer.com/docs/infer-bug-types.html#CONTEXT_LEAK) leaks). Extending the detection to handle other cases like `View` leaks or leaks via `SensorManager` would should be pretty straightforward.

The code for reporting `Context` leaks lives [here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/interproc.ml#L652), and the tests are [here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/tests/codetoanalyze/java/infer/ContextLeaks.java) (runnable with `make test`). I would probably start off by adding the examples from the blog post to see how many of them Infer can already find, and then refine the checker from there.

If you'd rather start from scratch, here's some [docs](http://fbinfer.com/docs/absint-framework.html) on building brand-new checkers on top of the Infer infrastructure.

Hope this helps and let me know if you have any questions!",sblackshear,2017-03-21 18:34:23

It seems that in the analysis, the <S_CODE_TOKEN> argument flows into the <S_CODE_TOKEN> function. And it is reasonable to infer that <S_CODE_TOKEN> also flows into the <S_CODE_TOKEN> argument. The analyzer should be able to learn that <S_CODE_TOKEN> is true, and reports no warning.

Regarding the magic number for the license, that's the hash of the license text for the current Android SDK License. Normally user agrees in GUI in Android Studio, or via `sdkmanager` CLI, then `licenses/android-sdk-license` is populated with that hash. In this script it's being done automatically, replacing functionality of `/opt/sdk-tools/android-accept-licenses.sh` in the current image. See https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update.html#download-with-gradle.

This is actually shaky ground because the user never explicitly agrees to the Android license (the current Dockerfile has this problem too, the license is automatically agreed to without user intervention). So you may want to remove this functionality of agreeing to the license automatically?

One other option (I'm checking now) is installing the Android dependencies from the Ubuntu package repo instead for purposes of having a working sample in the image, it might avoid the licensing problem.",3flex,
597,2017-03-02 15:56:57,"Ubuntu repo versions don't match the versions used in the sample. Could alter the sample to match, but I think having the dependencies continue to auto-download will be less of a headache?",3flex,
597,2017-03-03 11:17:59,"Thanks @3flex.

Please open a new PR to fix the gradle build.

Regarding the magic hash, maybe there could be a build argument that auto-accepts the license when passed. However, is it really needed? It looks like the user could accept the license only at the time when they run the Android example, at which point they have an interactive shell to accept it.

Probably the interactive step doesn't work inside `infer -- ./gradlew` because infer doesn't pass stdin to the build command, so `./run.sh` has to be modified to have a step before the analysis calling gradle in a minimal way just to give the user a chance to accept the license (if that makes sense).",jvillard,
597,2017-03-07 21:24:44,"I have a solution I'm happy with, but it depends on Android SDK Tools 25.3.x which has not yet been officially released.

Also depends on a new release of Infer with the Android Plugin for Gradle updates I'd submitted included so `infer -- ./gradlew build` will just work.

Once those are both out I'll update this PR.

What it does is show a message after build completes in `run.sh`, so you get a prompt like:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This relies on functionality in `sdkmanager` that was introduced in the new SDK Tools, allowing for easily accepting all licenses in one hit. I think it neatly solves the problem.

It means another ~140MB in the image so the SDK Tools can be preinstalled but it's still a big improvement over what's currently there.",3flex,

1) together with the build, run the Infer capture phase only

2) separately, find out what files you want to run the analysis on, and only analyze those files:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
where `index.txt` contains a list of files to analyze, with relative path from the root of the project.
So if your project looks like this
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
then an example `index.txt` can be
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Typically, you will want `index.txt` to contain the set of files modified in the current commit.

It's simpler because the user doesn't need to manually install build tools 22.0.1, SDK 22, or the Android Support Repository - they'll be automatically downloaded on `./gradlew build`, as long as the user has previously agreed to the SDK license on the machine they're using. It will ""just work"".

Infer needs a specific version of clang to run which is why it's shipped with infer. This is because it attaches a plugin to clang to read its AST, and this requires to be used with the same version of clang than the version that the plugin was compiled for.",jvillard,2017-03-07 18:16:27

It will spend more time on procedures before giving up. That often translates into more precision but your mileage may vary.

@xennygrimmato size of chains of function calls do not matter thanks to the way the interprocedural analysis is implemented: a caller only knows to read the spec of the callees, it doesn't need to go and look at their code.",jvillard,

However, if changing to kernel driver, such as .../driver/mmc/core/core.c, it will meet lots of header files doesn't include.
And if following aosp build kernel steps, http://source.android.com/source/building-kernels.html,

Does anyone has any experimence in building kernel sourcecode can share with me?! Appreciate that.",banfeng,
580,2017-02-13 10:07:27,"In general, in order to to analyze code with infer, you need working compilation command and most of the time we can't tell our users what the right command is.

With your example, let's say you want to analyze `../driver/mmc/core/core.c`:
you probably can't run `infer -- clang -c ../driver/mmc/core/core.c`, as it will miss header search paths. Instead, you need to find Makefile target that builds that file. 

As for analyzing linux kernel - normally kernel compiles only with gcc. Infer uses clang compiler and linux kernel probably won't compile with clang without changing linux source code. It's outside of scope of our project to make linux compile with clang.

Complex makefile projects may require more work to work with `infer`, but we can help with that if we have compilation that works without `infer`. See `libreoffice` as an example:

- it will show you if the error was filtered out
- if you are curious you can inspect the intermediate values of the analysis in ""infer-out/captured/test1.c.*.html"" (warning: this displays the internal symbolic execution state of infer which can be quite verbose).

Also, note that this example can crash on dereferencing any of the array indices, not just `6`, as `malloc()` may return `NULL`. I tried changing your example to exit if `malloc()` fails, but then infer gets confused about arithmetic and reports an array out of bounds.

Looking at the debug html, it seems that infer only remembers the last value put in the array in this example.",jvillard,

575,2017-02-06 16:41:30,"It can happen that infer fails to analyse a function for some reason. Possible reasons include infer getting confused when trying to understand the code, or the function taking too long to analyse.

When infer reports, calls to skipped functions are simply jumped over, which can leave people wondering why infer won't go inside the function. Including some information why infer skips a function inside such traces would be useful for both users and developers of Infer.

See https://github.com/facebook/infer/issues/572#issuecomment-277070348 for an example of what skipping a function currently looks like. Instead, something like this would be better:

**Now the problem.!!**

Eradicate throws a issue that, in checkString() method, name could be null and NPE will happen in .equals(""SomeConstants""). But if you look at notEmpty(name) is already having null check. 

So, why eradicate is not understanding the flow of code and what will be the best solution for this??

Any help is appreciated.",mohammedsafiq,2017-02-09 02:54:02
573,2017-02-02 09:12:42,"Hi @mohammedsafiq, Eradicate works pretty much like a type checker, where a value annotated @Nullable is considered as always being potentially null, so local checks for null are required.
In particular, Eradicate does not try to understand the flow of values in a method call, such as `notEmpty(name)`. Another way to look at this: it only considers information at method boundaries, so it will give the same result for any implementation of `notEmpty`, including the one which always returns `true`.

572,2017-01-31 14:09:55,"Infer includes the evaluation of sub-expressions in the trace, so the way to read this is:
1. `pVal` is true
2. `!pVal` is false

I agree that this can be confusing when negations are involved, especially when the subexpression is trivial. This could be made clearer by adding column number information to the traces to clarify which sub-expression is being evaluated. This is quite hard as, eg, the Java frontend does not provide column number information as of yet. Or, infer could have a special case for trivial sub-expressions of negations, but maybe that's too ad-hoc.

Maybe the easiest way to solve this would be to print the sub-expression in the trace message:

559,2017-01-10 05:07:06,"Not sure if this is a bug or a missing feature (or neither).  I have two source files as input.  

T1.java:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
However, if I first compile T1.java with javac **without** running Eradicate, and then run javac on T2.java with Eradicate, I get no error:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
Hence it seems that Eradicate is not reading the `@NonNull` annotation from the T1.class file.  If this is in fact a missing feature and not a bug, I think it'd be a very useful addition for Eradicate to be able to leverage annotations in extant class files.

> I think it'd be a very useful addition for Eradicate to be able to leverage annotations in extant class files.

Could you describe concrete example you had in mind? Why can't you simply compile them with `infer --` as well?",akotulski,
559,2017-01-10 16:22:30,"Thanks for the response!  The main motivating example is with 3rd-party libraries.  If the library is unannotated, there are [tools](https://types.cs.washington.edu/annotation-file-utilities/) that let you inject separately-written annotations into the class files.  (Why not add annotations to the source and contribute back?  Some libraries, like [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki), don't want to introduce any third-party dependencies, e.g., on annotation classes.  Also, it's possible you don't have the source.)  So it'd be cool if Eradicate could leverage these class-file annotations to do better checking.  

Additionally, it may be that you don't care about errors within the 3rd-party library, in which case you'll get some build-time win by not running Infer on the library source code.    ",msridhar,
559,2017-01-10 18:28:19,"Hi @msridhar.

It is theoretically possible to follow the annotations from the 3rd party libraries. One thing that is not so clear is that different libraries do not necessarily follow the same convention when it comes to `@Nullable`. For example, for analyzed source code, 
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
is equivalent to:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
for Eradicate, meaning that parameter are consider non-nullable by default except when analyzed with `@Nullable` explicitly.

However, your example suggests that we would want to do the opposite assumption for 3rd party libraries when unannotated variables should be considered as `@Nullable` by default except when annotated with `@NonNull`. But this approach would not work for Guava for instance, which uses `@Nullable` more or less as Eradicate expects it. So there should be a way to tell Eradicate, or to detect automatically, which convention is used for each library. 

Or we may want to follow a 3-value logic for libraries and consider no annotation as `unknown` together with `@NonNull` and `@Nullable` ",jeremydubreil,
559,2017-01-10 18:56:24,"Hi @jeremydubreil yes that's a good point.  My example was contrived; I wanted to keep things simple to make sure I was running the tool correctly.  Probably the right thing to do is to assume usage similar to Guava when annotations from class files are being parsed.  If it's clearly documented, I think that would work well for most cases.  Also, maybe the default should be to behave just as Infer does now (ignoring annotations in class files) to avoid surprises and/or a ton of unwanted false positives.  ",msridhar,
559,2017-01-10 19:32:38,"One additional issue that I just became aware of: annotations on method parameters/return values actually live in the constant pool, not in the method signature. For already-compiled classes (and anything else in the classpath), we parse the method signature and add it to the type environment, but we don't look at the implementation of the method or its constant pool. This is why you're seeing the weird behavior on your example.

We might be able to parse only the constant pool in such cases so we can at least have the annotations for pre-compiled code. Will look into it.",sblackshear,
559,2017-01-10 20:36:23,"@sblackshear, it would actually be easy to load the annotations from the 3rd party library. There is already some support for analyzing the dependencies. For example (changing the example a bit to avoid the issue with `@NonNull` mentioned earlier):

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
and
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
We can actually have Eradicate report the issue using the undocumented `--dependencies` options:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
The reason why we don't use `--dependencies` by default is to avoid duplication of work when using Buck as the same class. e.g. `java.lang.String` could otherwise be analyzed on many different Buck targets.

The new genrule based approach to integrate Infer with Buck could actually allow use to analyze the third party libraries only once (decorating `prebuilt_jar`) and cache the analysis artifacts, which would contain the annotations as well. cc @kageiit

559,2017-01-13 22:39:58,"@jeremydubreil That sounds like a great idea.

554,2017-01-09 13:28:24,I see. I wonder if it would be better to bump the required version of opam instead of trying to support older versions like 1.2.0. I use 1.2.2 and I don't see this issue. Otherwise we might break opam 1.2.0 again in the future without noticing it.,jvillard,2017-01-12 18:39:07
554,2017-01-10 12:40:00,"@chaws does upgrading opam solve the issue for you? If so, could you please change your PR to bump the required version of opam up?

As it stands, opam 1.2.0 is untested on our end so even if we include your fix it's possible we end up breaking it again in the future. 1.2.2 is available on many major systems. Debian stable still uses 1.2.0 but it's easy to manually upgrade.

Let me know if that makes sense to you, we could also find a way to test opam 1.2.0 in our Travis CI for instance.",jvillard,2017-01-12 18:39:07

have you tried running the xcodebuild command without `infer`, that is:

If succeeds, maybe it's the space in the path where the project is located:

You should be able to install Python 2.7 alongside Python 3.5.2 to use infer. `infer` calls `python27` explicitly so in particular the `python` executable can point to Python 3.5.2 so as not to affect your Python environment.,jvillard,2016-12-30 07:36:53

545,2016-12-29 10:48:14,"> So the problem is that configure phase must be aware of infer analyzer for makefile integration to work?

In this case, yes.

The way infer is integrated with `make` is a simple `PATH` trick that replaces gcc/clang/... with our wrappers that run infer instead. `PATH` has no power when the path to the compiler is used instead of just its name (eg, `/usr/bin/clang` will not lookup `PATH`, so will bypass infer).

Some build systems such as `cmake` and LibreOffice's custom build system defeat this simple mechanism, and `PATH` has to be set earlier, at configuration time, so that the path to the compiler is set to infer: `infer -a compile -- ./configure` or `infer -a compile -- cmake` will do this.",jvillard,2017-01-06 17:47:58

545,2017-01-05 10:27:18,"Those errors are because we have our own simplified headers for `std::unique_ptr` so that analyzer understands it. Unfortunately, in your case those headers conflict with standard ones and we didn't catch it (see below for more info). If you can compile infer from source, you can work around this problem by changing one line in `ClangCommand.re`: https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/clang/ClangCommand.re#L32
simply change it to `let infer_cxx_models = false`. It will make analysis worse (no null dereference in `shared_ptr`, `unique_ptr`, no EMPTY_VECTOR_ACCESS from `vector`), but you should be able to run infer.

The reason why you are hitting this problem is because mechanism we model `unique_ptr` is fragile. We 'replace' normal headers with ours by providing another `bits/unique_ptr.h` header which normally works. Unfortunately, there is weird implementation in one of stdlibc++ headers (`bits/locale_conv.h`) which includes `bits/unique_ptr.h` via `#include ""unique_ptr.h""` and we can't detect that.

simply change it to let infer_cxx_models = false.

It would be nice, to make it configurable, though. That would make patching `infer` avoidable.

> I have plans to change this mechanism, but I suspect it will take a while to complete.

That would be great to get fixed ASAP, because i suspect that each and every non trivial C++ project will exhibit that problem.",davido,2017-01-06 17:47:58

You are right that it will break anyone that ends up including that header, unfortunately it's not trivial to replace our current mechanism with more robust one.

If we get more reports like this, I'll try to think of better workaround for the problem. The most trivial one for you would be to copy-paste contents of `/path/to/stdc++/include/bits/locale_conv.h` to `infer/models/cpp/include/bits/locale_conv.h` and then replace faulty `#include ""unique_ptr.h""` with `#include <bits/unique_ptr.h>` (then you could revert previous workaround I suggested)",akotulski,2017-01-06 17:47:58

545,2017-01-06 10:36:23,"At this point I can tell that this is one of the more complex open source projects I've seen so far :)

The problem with infer's current mechanism is that we replace std headers with different ones which are not equivalent (`shared_ptr` is not refcounted for example) and hence we explicitly disallow to run binaries that were created with our headers. In your case, it looks like that you
1. create a tool X to do something with code
2. run X to produce something
3. use results of (2) as source for compilation (?)

To fix this, I see two options:
Option one:
I assume you have target in `make` that does only (3) and there is target that does (1) and (2)
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Option two:
Similar to what your tried to achieve in last comment - you can try to exclude directories that are responsible for tools created in (1). Create `.inferconfig` file in project root directory (which by default is the directory you run infer from) and specify parameter called `skip-clang-analysis-in-path` with paths relative to project root directory (it can be path to directory, not separate files).

Both of those options should hit [the same code path in infer](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/clang/Capture.re#L161) and simply compile tool X.",akotulski,2017-01-06 17:47:58

I'm doing research about analysis tools for Android apps and one of it is this Infer.

537,2016-12-20 18:52:14,"Hi Michael,
  We don't currently have any special support for JUnit annotations like `@Test`, but we could add support if there is a need.

In general, I'm skeptical of the utility of statically analyzing small pieces of test code like your example (since one can always just run the code and let JUnit check if the right thing happens). But I'm intrigued by the possibility of using JUnit assertions to specify statically checkable contracts in non-test code. Let me me know if you are interested in that use case/have examples and we can try to throw some support together.",sblackshear,
537,2016-12-20 19:11:58,"Thanks a lot for the feedback!

For us, this has come up as part of various larger code bases. (I agree that static analysis of small snippets is of limited use.) My example was just intended so as to have a reproducible test scenario. Arguably we could work on ways to exclude tests from the analysis altogether.

For specifications, I am wondering whether JUnit is most suitable; wouldn't JML possibly be a better approach?",tautschnig,
537,2016-12-20 21:06:03,"Another issue that is independent of annotations is that infer does consider whether there is an enclosing handler for RuntimeExceptions.

",jberdine,

> For specifications, I am wondering whether JUnit is most suitable; wouldn't JML possibly be a better approach?

I don't have any strong opinion about this. If you already have a large codebase with lots of JML annotations or lots of programmers who would be willing to write JML annotations in exchange for having them statically checked, then I think JML sounds like a great choice.",sblackshear,
536,2016-12-14 03:21:21,"Hi,

I have had experience of developing compilers' backend. Generally the backend is started in debug, e.g. gdb, and stops at some breakpoints. The backend can be executed step by step and function calls can be followed by stepping into. The IR of the analyzed program can be printed to stdout/stderr or dumped into files. 

However, as a newcomer of OCaml, I cannot find the counterpart things in debugging Infer's backend, which is implemented in OCaml and compiled to native code. Ocamldebug can only work on bytecode. For natvie code, gdb can break at modules' functions, but I found it is extremely hard to print variables' value in OCaml programs. That means examining IR and analysis results in Infer's backend is not easy.

I have read the book, real-world-ocaml and seen Mark Shinwell's video 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF2WpWnB-nk'. Both them does not give much instructions on printing variables in gdb. 

How do you infer developers debug hundreds of thousands of lines of OCaml code?  Could someone give some advice?

Thanks a lot in advance.

536,2016-12-14 12:44:19,"Hi, 
Most of us don't use a debugger to debug Infer. We just print elements, most of the IR elements have print functions, so we use those. To debug the symbolic execution in particular, we use html files that have printed most of the execution. You get those files with the option --debug, there is an html file for each source file in the folder infer-out/captured. Also, when you print things, if you use Logging.out, the output is only available in debug mode, and in infer-out/log/.... 

I hope this helps, let us know if you have more questions.

I should have also mentioned this before, but yes, parallel processes can analyze the same procedure simultaneously.  There are mechanisms to protect against reading partially written files, for when one process reads the specs of a procedure while another is writing them, etc.  But there is intentionally nothing blocking multiple parallel processes from analyzing any individual procedure simultaneously.  The intended usage is to write an analysis which produces a spec for each procedure such that if multiple processes analyze the procedure in parallel, they will obtain the same spec, so it does not matter which process wins the race to write the spec.  It is important and can be nontrivial to design the analysis so that the computed specs are always the same.  Any use of global or file system state must be done with care, and other sources of non-determinism need to be minimized or eliminated.

- Try running infer with `--no-filtering`
- Report on the `proc_name`/ `proc_desc`/`location` of the current procedure rather using `e.proc_desc` and so on. I think all of the checkers we have so far log errors that occur in a function `foo` called from `main` in `main` rather than in `foo` (we have a mechanism for displaying interprocedural traces that will show the path from `main` to `foo`). In principle, reporting the error from anywhere should work, but I haven't tried it.

@cristianoc's advice about disabling the the other checkers is also very important.

514,2016-12-01 17:35:47,"Ah, so the parameter `e.proc_name` is `main` in your example (as it should be, I think). Does the parameter `e.proc_desc` also correspond to the procdesc of `main`?",sblackshear,2016-12-10 21:42:47
514,2016-12-01 17:46:38,"No. I want to keep the original location of errors, so each <S_CODE_TOKEN> has its original information.

For example,
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
I collect all the errors after analyzing <S_CODE_TOKEN>, i.e., <S_CODE_TOKEN> = {error1, error2}.
So <S_CODE_TOKEN> = <S_CODE_TOKEN>, <S_CODE_TOKEN> = <S_CODE_TOKEN>, and so on. 
When I just print them out using <S_CODE_TOKEN>,  the output is correct,
but <S_CODE_TOKEN> misses  <S_CODE_TOKEN> in <S_CODE_TOKEN>.

I would try logging errors as soon as they are detected (if you can) and see if that fixes the problem. Alternatively, I'm happy to try debugging the issue in my end if you send a pull request or email me the code for the checker.",sblackshear,2016-12-10 21:42:47

By the way, the analysis on multiple files run in parallel? 
I use a reference type value (counter) to make unique symbols when analyzing each procedure.
I don't fully understand the whole Infer system so I am suspicious about the uniqueness.

No.  If procedures are recursive, they may be analyzed a few times.  Each procedure should have only a single spec written to disk, however.

Also, multiple parallel processes may analyze the same procedure multiple times and race to write the spec to disk.
",jberdine,2016-12-10 21:42:47
514,2016-12-09 17:17:27,"We read more Infer code and our issue became more clear. I remind you about our situation.

1. A callee(`foo`) and a caller(`main`) are in different files.
2. A bug is in the callee.
3. When analyzing the callee, we are not sure that the code is buggy. Thus, after analyzing the callee, we do not report the bug yet.
4. After analyzing the caller, we are sure there is a bug in the callee. So we report it then.

The bug report code is as follows. Since we use the `caller_name` as the seccond argument, the bug info is added to caller(`main`)'s summary.
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

 A problem is when printing it to `report.json`.  `InferPrint.IssueJson.pp_issues_of_error_log` constructs a record, `bug`, for printing, but the location is strange; the line/column number from `foo`'s file, but the file name from `main`'s.
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This causes an incorrect report. Even though, the bug is in `foo`, the file of `main` is printed.
The line number `2` is about the file of `foo`, not of `main`.
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

As of now, we are using `loc.Location.file` instead of `file` when constructing the `bug` record, but not sure it is a correct way. Can you give us some advice?",skcho,2016-12-10 21:42:47
514,2016-12-09 18:09:56,"I would recommend reporting an interprocedural trace starting at `main` and ending in `foo`. There's a general mechanism for creating and displaying such traces. To check out the visualization, you can run Infer (the bi-abduction analyzer) on a file with an interprocedural trace, then run `inferTraceBugs` (as described [here](http://fbinfer.com/docs/infer-workflow.html)).

To get your own nifty traces that can be visualized by `inferTraceBugs`, you'll need to create an [`Errlog.loc_trace`](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/IR/Errlog.ml#L27). You can then pass this trace to the `ltr` parameter `Reporting.log_error` ([example](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/quandary/TaintAnalysis.ml#L182)).

With the information you have in your current domain, I *think* you'll only be able to give the starting point and ending point of the trace (i.e., `main` and `foo` but not `callsFoo` if the call graph is `main` -> `callsFoo` -> `foo`), but that's still a great start! In the long run, it might be useful to change the domain so you can report the entire path.",sblackshear,2016-12-10 21:42:47
514,2016-12-09 18:17:52,Thank you. I will take a look at it.,skcho,2016-12-10 21:42:47
514,2016-12-10 11:37:15,@sblackshear We solved our issue by collecting the starting points and ending points of the traces as you said. It works now though we did not apply the general `TraceDomain`. Thank you for help again.,skcho,2016-12-10 21:42:47

It looks like time-1.7.c was generated on another computer with different layout for system headers, but infer should be smart enough to deal with it.
Currently I'm overhauling this part of the system and will fix this bug, but it may take some time before it's fixed.",akotulski,2016-12-05 14:19:27

Note that infer doesn't really support running on preprocessed source code (other than ""it shouldn't raise exceptions""), so I'm discouraging you from doing it if possible. Recent changes to our frontend broke this and it may break again in the future. This fix doesn't restore all functionalities there were before either and you'll need to pass extra option to `infer` (see below).

That being said, if you want to do that, remember to run infer with `--headers` option so that frontend translates everything from that file. Otherwise it won't translate anything. Everything includes all system headers which is not the case with default `infer` invocation.

Feel free to reopen if this doesn't work for you",akotulski,2016-12-05 14:19:27

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The captured log says that SIL's instruction APPLY_ABSTRACTION just before the loop abstracts (almost) all array content, and it causes FP above. If I move the array initialization into the loop, FP will disappear.

And I took a slightly detailed look into it. It seems that APPLY_ABSTRACTION abstracts all the existing arrays at the current execution point (*1). I think that arrays of some kind like here can be left concrete (though it requires some look-ahead in symbolic execution?). 

*1 https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/absarray.ml#L535 here strexp_can_abstract returns true for all arrays with size > 1.

(Though I'm not sure whether such access with a constant exists in a real-world code, I would like to point here that current implementation abstracts some strexps too much.)

After following the steps from here https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/INSTALL.md#pre-compiled-versions i'm still unsable to install the new version of infer. 
:/# opam --version
1.2.2
I see that on the `pwd`/infer/bin is only:

Do you know where is the problem ?

505,2016-11-16 13:03:46,"can you add the already compiled code to the archive ?
Like it is on versions 0.9.0 and 0.9.1 ?

505,2016-11-16 13:25:37,"> `versionGLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found` 

That's the issue. Your system doesn't supply the version of glibc++ needed by the precompiled plugin that we provide. You can either install that version on your system (probably by upgrading your version of gcc) or recompile clang and its plugin yourself by following the instructions to install infer from source in INSTALL.md.

What system are you using?

Note that none of our releases include a binary version of the analyzer for reasons beyond our control. We do include a precompiled clang and clang plugins, but that's exactly what's causing your issue here because they are compiled with a version of glibc++ incompatible with your system.

",bmihaescu,2016-11-30 21:22:24
505,2016-11-16 15:06:59,"`infer/bin/infer` used to be a Python script that called the analyzer, the plugin, etc. While the toplevel `infer` executable could be shipped as-is, everything else still needed to be compiled for `infer` to work. So the situation hasn't changed since 0.9.0, except for the fact that the toplevel `infer` command is now also written in OCaml and so needs compiling.

Regarding your issue, I think it would help if we provided statically linked binaries for clang and the clang plugins instead of relying on some of the host system's libraries.
",jvillard,2016-11-30 21:22:24

Please open a separate issue about alternate packaging and distribution, or add to e.g. #470 .

For the particular build failure in the original issue, I'm closing this optimistically, but please reopen if  building the current version wholly from source to resolve library version issues does not work.",jberdine,2016-11-30 21:22:24
504,2016-11-15 05:34:30,"Rules that set `javac_jar` or if it is configured in `.buckconfig`, do not invalidate the buck cache for infer as it always uses a javac from path. This leads to different build behavior in buck and infer and creates cache key duplication for the network cache.

504,2016-11-15 20:53:38,"I am not sure I understand. Using Infer will create infer specific cache entires anyway that should be separated from the cache entries of the normal build. 

Infer can use the `javac_jar` to compile the code by adding the option:

infer should be able to add `.inferconfig` as a src to every rule to make sure the invalidation happens automatically. I believe it already adds the generated python script as a source to ensure such invalidation",kageiit,

I had a look to the problem. 
The problem is that infer makes at some point a wrong assumption that 10*sizeof(int) could be zero.
This implies that g_realloc will return zero, and at line 8 we dereference null.

Given this problem, the functon set_foo won't get a specification and when it is called at line 10, 
infer doesn't know what set_foo does, and in particular that it free f->p. So it will flag a memory leak.

So, I'm gonna look why infer thinks that 10*sizeof(int) may be zero.

**Some extra info:**

Unless I'm crazy, which is not unlikely, I recall that using `while(true){}` worked (in the sense that there was a warning when such a piece of code was reachable). But now (08d4465e1dbde345fd96a2df13640388ff20b85f), I don't get any warning on file `A.java` with content

Is there something that can be used as an **error** statement (in Java)? Do I need to give it some command line options? If it's not possible now, are there any plans to introduce one? As you know, other tools do support such a statement; most notably, it's used in the SV-COMP benchmarks.

492,2016-11-05 15:34:01,"This is possible, but only in a somewhat hacky way at the moment. You can use `Object o = null; o.toString()` as an alias for `assert false`, and Infer will report a null dereference on `o` only if it thinks that the dereference is reachable.

Here's how I tried to use your second proposal (so you can check if I did something wrong):

I think that the triple you want is what can/will inferred for the on-paper version of the bi-abduction algorithm, but the Infer implementation chooses to report a warning in this case for pragmatic reasons (assuming that all branches are reachable in some context lets us report more bugs without causing too many false positives). 

If I'm right about this, I'm not immediately sure how to talk Infer into doing what you want. Let me think about it a bit more.

(Copying @cristianoc and @ddino since they have better knowledge about how the theory and practice diverge here.)
",sblackshear,2016-11-14 11:36:38
492,2016-11-05 17:18:48,"Notice that Infer works bottom-up, so if `g` calls `f` then Infer's decision on whether reporting on `f` will not be affected by how `g` calls it.
For example, If `f` contains `if (a) {Object o = null; o.toString();}` then the error is reported in `f` no matter how it's called.
If `f` contains instead `if (a) {o.toString();}` then nothing is reported in `f` but will be reported in `g` if it calls `f` the wrong way (with `a=true` and `o=null`).
Being bottom-up, it might be difficult to model the typical top-down reachability question, as if the error is reported half way through the chain of calls, it won't be reported in calls higher up the call stack.
One attempt could be to put a dereference in the code that you wish to know if reachable, as in `foo(Object r,...) { ...r.toString;...}`
Then pass r through each call, untouched, and only call it with `null` from `main`, or from the roots of the program where one would like to know if it's reachable.
Another proviso is that the analysis might fail for a number of reasons (errors found, limits to the number of operations, etc), so it might not explore all the paths, and fail to report reachability.

So, that's OK in principle. But, why is there an error reported in `f` in the `T2` example? Clearly it can continue propagating up the pre.

489,2016-10-27 09:42:08,"HI,

Basically I ran infer to analyse my Xcode project yesterday and it came up with over 100 issues. I have dealt with some of the issues and to check I ran a xcodecuild clean and then tried running infer in a similar way. However now it analysis 1 file and says no issues. I am confused on why this has happened?

Thanks in advance,

Feras A.

1. Is the version of Infer the same on both days?
2. Command you ran on both occasions

Doing xcodebuild clean should cause infer to analyze everything again, so this is not expected.

One possible option is to set `skip-clang-analysis-in-path` in .inferconfig or on the command line to avoid analyzing particularly problematic code.  Identifying this code is somewhat roundabout, as you need to, while infer is running, observe which InferAnalyze process(es) consume the most memory, look at the command line to see which 'cluster' it is analyzing (clNNN for some number NNN), and then find that cluster in the generated Makefile (infer-out/multicore/Makefile), and look at the comment in that Makefile that indicates which source file(s) the cluster corresponds to.

I think the problem here is that your compilation process is generating llvm-bitcode, which we don't support.
Try disabling it via xcode, or by adding `ENABLE_BITCODE=NO` to your xcodebuild command.

Thanks!

476,2016-10-08 06:11:08,"Hello,

I intend to look into the control graph (or the execution path tree) provided by Infer but I find that I cannot understand the output. Ideally, I think the execution tree should look like:

a > 5
(true) b < 3
          (true) foo1
          (false) foo2
(false) foo3

Follow the instruction here: http://fbinfer.com/docs/advanced-features.html#debug-mode, I use the command `infer --debug -- <build command>` to generate the HTML files at captured/, which is said to contain the ""symbolic execution result"". However, I find it is extremely hard to parse the result there into the human-readable execution tree. I find each node has ""preds"" and ""succs"", which might be the edge of the execution tree. Unfortunately, when I click into a node, the information is extremely heavy and I have no idea how to translate it into the path condition (`a>5` in the example above) when a branch occurs.

Any idea to extract such information from the HTML file? I believe it should somehow be there.

Thanks in advance!

476,2016-10-08 18:56:44,"The `icfg.dot` files mentioned in the debug mode documentation might be more along the lines of what you are looking for. You can view the CFG in these files using `dotty` or any other tool that understands the graphviz format. This won't have details about the abstract state at each program point, but it should be easier to understand the flow.

476,2016-10-08 23:36:06,"Thank you! I've taken a look at `icfg.dot` and it seems to still include the abstract states“ (Please let me know if the attachment is not visible):

I only find this one branch in my target function (in fact there should be several branches). And I'm kind of confused what the path condition is for this branch - I see both false branch (showed in the figure) and true branch (not showed in the figure, at the right arrow) but I indeed cannot figure out what causes the branch. In other words, which variable is symbolic? What is the value for it to introduce branch?

Do I miss anything here for the `icfg.dot`?

Thanks again for your help!

476,2016-10-09 13:56:06,"I think that there might be some confusion here about what information `icfg.dot` is presenting.  The `icfg.dot` files contain the static control-flow graph, which is determined by the source code and control-flow paths that might be impossible are not removed.

From the comments, with the mention of e.g. ""which variable is symbolic"", it seems that @zzy assumes that infer operates in a way similar to King-style symbolic execution.  I don't think that trying to understand what infer does in these terms is useful, since what it actually does is very different.  A better starting point is probably http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2049697.2049700.

I think distributing this with infer as-is may be problematic because assert failures are reported as null pointer dereferences, which is incorrect.

However, it looks like including this macro definition in your code as you're doing in your example produces the same result without having to modify infer at all. Does this cover your use-case well enough?

Yes. It's useful for me. Because the result shows the assertion failure location as following:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Today, I'm using VeriFast https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bart.jacobs/verifast/ for my project. It can assert pre/postcondition. Of course, Infer also can do that. This patch's purpose  is to let beginers to be good with directions around such assertion on Infer.
",master-q,2016-10-03 00:54:41
472,2016-10-01 13:22:39,"Yes, I understand the value of having this macro in a project.

But I'm afraid it's still unclear to me what the value of hardcoding this in infer would be:
- it makes infer report the wrong kind of error (NPE instead of assertion failure), which is incorrect and confusing
-  unless I missed something, you still need to define that macro in your own code if you want it to compile, so isn't the situation pretty much the same with and without your patch?

Yes. It's possible.

> unless I missed something, you still need to define that macro in your own code if you want it to compile, so isn't the situation pretty much the same with and without your patch?

Yes. I can have it in my own project.
I'm afraid that many people believe Infer can't verify such assert, only do check memory error.

Totally, I think I should close this issue without merge, and write some blog entry at my web page.

470,2016-09-28 10:54:38,"Hello infer dev-team,

compiling/installing infer seems to be a common problem.

Personal experience (on Mac):
I have had trouble installing infer 0.8.1 in the beginning and managed to get it compiled/installed after half a day.
I had problems installing infer 0.9.1? and gave up.
I could install 0.9.2 without problems via brew on one machine. Later when installing on a 2nd machine, I could not get it install via brew. I copied over the binary from machine 1, then it worked.
Just now I failed on my try to install 0.9.3.

There are also some issues here on github regarding installation.

Since tools/Xcode/command line utilities/libraries/OS and so on constantly change, it is a lot of effort to maintain a working installation script.

Wouldn't it make the lives of ordinary developers like me easier, if there was a binary distribution of infer? Wouldn't it be hard enough for all the great developers, who work on infer, to figure out the right set of libraries/compilers/environemnt? Couldn't their achievements of getting infer compiled on their machines be harnessed and transferred in binary self-contained form to other developers?

I am not such a good developer to be aware of all the consequences and the pros of source distribution (except for allowing further development) over binary distribution. I might be overlooking something. But I wonder, why ""normal"" consumer facing applications like the ones on the App Stores are distributed in binary form and usually survive many more OS updates and library changes on the system (due to static linking?), yet source distribution is so popular.

Thank you for writing this great tool and making it available publicly!
Kind regards
Nikolas

Here is one additional requirements that could improve the checker:
- in order to identify a property as delegate, besides containing ""delegate"" in the name also require the usage of a protocol in the type.
- In this case it it also obvious, that a class from the Foundation framework does not play the role of a delegate - but since those classes can always implement a protocol via a class extension, this might not be a good thing to check.

Currently, I'm struggling with making infer detect simple resource leak. I've modeled `PQconnectdb` as `fopen`, `PQfinish` as `fclose` and call only the former in `main`. I've tried both: compiling my model with `models-mode` and copying specs to the hardcoded path and compiling the model together with `main`. In both cases `infer` didn't find the resource leak.

In the end, It would be convenient then to distribute models separately. In the infers' source, I've seen at least two options that look relevant: `specs-library` and `zip-specs-library` but infer does not recognize them or I using them wrong.

1. `pq.h` - library header, you won't need it if you are using real `libpq`
2. `pq.c` - library model implementation. This is where you put your models
3. `pq_client.c` - library user code.

Then I ran infer twice:
1. build specs in separate directory by running `infer -o pq-out -- clang -c pq.c`

456,2016-09-08 13:34:11,"Regarding globals - there are many options to treat global variables better, your suggestion is one of them. The problem is that tracking many variables in each function can cause performance issues and/or confuse analyzer.

I reproduced your problem and unfortunately it's known limitation of C analysis - infer doesn't treat structs in C very well. In particular, pass-by-value and return-by-value confuse our analyzer right now. In your code, `exit_nicely` confuses infer and then when you call it in line 66, analyzer gives up with `PRECONDITION_NOT_MET` error. Minimized example looks like this:
https://gist.github.com/akotulski/7e73ef3ef8b0f9d9d1155dc1843b4dd3

Structs in C++ have much better support and the same example works for me in C++ mode, but I understand it may not be an option to you. I tested example above in C++ mode (`infer --cxx -- clang -x c++ -c test.c`) and it reported resource leak.

There is open task to address those problems with structs in C, but no one is actively working on it right now.

UPDATE: to illustrate the problem, changing `exit_nicely` to take `state*` instead of `state` triggers `RESOURCE_LEAK` reports as well.

It has to do with compiling assembly code (somehow infer doesn't run the right thing). The problem with solving those issue is that it's hard for us to reproduce.

Would it be possible for you to share complete example that doesn't work for you?
I suspect it might be enough to put `ReactNative` library in ///Vendors and compile it same way you are compiling in your app.

This makes it very hard to exclude auto generated source files from codegen for skipping translation in Infer.

Seems like the a new `FilePatternMatcher` can be supported for this.

Once that is available, it would be nice to auto exclude generated source folders in build systems like buck automatically

",jeremydubreil,
454,2016-09-06 21:50:11,"The best information to distinguish these files is the directory where they come from. All generated sources typically have an ancestor dir that contains them.

the commands to look for are hardcoded to invoke the correct modules. This prevents users the flexibility to wrap such commands in their own.

For example, we wrap all buck invocations in a `buckw` script to perform some steps before the actual buck run and invoke it like `./buckw build target`, very similar to `./gradlew task`

Can there be a configuration option in inferconfig that can specify aliases to different commands?
",kageiit,2016-09-01 17:11:26
453,2016-09-01 16:39:54,"Right now there is no such option - you may try adding `buckw` to the list in line you provided, but it's not guaranteed to out of the box for `buck` (we may have hardcoded `buck` in our buck integration).

Another short term solution is to make `which buck` point to your script, but I can imagine it may not be an option for you.

As for adding an option, we could add it in following form (modulo naming):

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Allowing such option may lead to maintenance problems - we are assuming a lot under the hood which means that `my_great_custom_script` needs to work exactly as `buck`. In case of `buckw` this should be true. In case of some random script/binary it will lead to a lot of pain when upgrading infer (to whoever uses this option)
@jvillard @jberdine - do you have any objections/alternatives in regards to adding `--run-capture-module` option to infer?

But I don't think this is a great idea since it's easy to install opam without an installer system compiler.

What about adding an environment variable to build-infer.sh to control the behaviour? If set, can easily check the installed version and fail if it's not the supported version. This adds flexibility and the default would remain as-is.

Here's something horrible I started working on - I can try cleaning it up a little and submitting a PR if it seems like a suitable direction:

1. For default no-hassle installation, do `./build-infer.sh`
2. For all other worflows, there's an ""expert mode"", which is just the usual `./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && sudo make install` (`./autogen.sh` not needed for the releases). `./configure` will even suggest the right `opam` command to install the infer dependencies in the current switch if they are missing. It will also work for non-opam OCaml installations.

We could also advertise 2. more.",jvillard,
451,2017-02-28 16:05:56,"Good to know - I was wondering if build-infer.sh was the canonical install method, but if there are two methods as you described that works.

I've been hacking on the Dockerfile a bit to try and bring the resulting image size down (it's currently 4GB+) and it would be easier to use the manual method to install in the Dockerfile than rely on build-infer.sh which is designed for ease of use. For that use case the manual method easily allows using the system compiler (bringing the image build time down as well).

I'll open a PR for the Dockerfile soon.",3flex,

448,2016-08-29 09:40:07,"I think by default infer uses as many processes as there are cores on the machine (specifically, the result of `getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN 2>/dev/null`). How many cores your machine has?

If you are using `infer -- make ...` or `infer -- buck build ...`, you can use `-l` option limit load average. You can also decrease number of parallel jobs, by passing `-j` flag.

[Here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/checkers/liveness.ml) is a simple checker that you can imitate to get started. This checker computes the set of live variables at each program points, which requires traversing each instruction and expression type in SIL.

Once you've created  a checker that looks like this, you can add it to the checkers to be run in registerCheckers.ml, then run the checkers on code with `infer -a checkers -- <build_cmd>`

For detecting `x % y`, I would do something like this:

We create separate opam switch intentionally to not pollute default opam switch (in case someone uses it for other ocaml development). The downside I know about is that ocaml needs to be rebuilt (but only once).

Yes, even with this, it clones a separate compiler but it clones from existing one rather than downloading and building 4.02.3 compiler  again even if it is installed.

As you can see from https://gist.github.com/ronin13/5bd675296326c3bfdff9e2e3dfc26a88 it doesn't modify the opam switch.

428,2016-08-05 10:53:47,"Hello @xennygrimmato,
To use `L.err`/`L.out` you have to be in developer mode, which means you need to invoke infer with the `--developer-mode` argument (as you can see [here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/fe780cb6ffd236cf618c2f9b63b03ddd2de18764/infer/src/backend/logging.ml#L142-L148))

But even if you use that, there may be many different processes running one after the other during the analysis thus overwriting the content of the `analyzer_err` and `analyzer_out` log files, and this should explain why they look empty at the end.

For now, try using `L.stdout`/`L.stderr` to get your output in the console, and you don't need to run in developer mode to use it.

Thanks

427,2016-08-09 11:28:53,"@brotherpaul143 Thanks for your interest in Infer. Perhaps there is some oversight, but as far as we understand Infer does not satisfy the SATE criteria. Infer produces two basic forms of output: 1) specifications of procedures / functions / methods, and 2) issue reports for property violations. Only the inferred specifications are claimed to be sound (subject to some idealistic and optimistic assumptions). Here the notion of sound is that from the logical tradition. In particular, if infer produces {P} f(x) {Q}, then soundness means that execution of f from any state satisfying P does not crash and unless it diverges, the state after f returns satisfies Q. The reports of property violations are produced primarily from failed proofs of such specifications. There is no definition of correctness for these reports, let alone a claim of soundness for them.

427,2016-08-09 12:27:48,"The Ockham criteria was established to highlight the strength of analyzers using rigorous inference, in contrast to those that use heuristics. It does not require that all results be absolutely correct (halting problem, after all). Rather, are there some results that are correct? Since Infer results of {P} f(x) {Q} are always correct, given the qualifications you mention, I believe Infer would be consonant with the goals of Ockham.

427,2016-08-16 12:34:39,"@brotherpaul143 it seems that Infer and SATE use two opposite definitions of correct/sound. From your website:

""1. The tool is claimed to be sound.""

and

""Sound means every finding is correct. The tool need not produce a finding for every site; that is completeness.""

This is simply not the case for Infer: reports made by Infer may not correspond to an actual weakness in the code.

Note that Infer is sound in the logical sense, which seems to correspond to your notion of ""completeness"": if Infer doesn't report on a procedure, then that procedure has no bugs (as @jberdine said, ""subject to some idealistic and optimistic assumptions""). Infer reports a bug when it fails to prove that a procedure has no bugs (and when Infer's internal heuristics suggest that it may correspond to a real issue, otherwise Infer would be too noisy), not when it can prove that a procedure definitely has a bug.

427,2016-08-16 13:35:54,"I agree with you, @jvillard   Please note that Ockham uses the term ""finding"". The use of ""finding"" allows an additional level of interpretation. As you point out, ""if Infer doesn't report on a procedure, then that procedure has no bugs"". The _lack_ of a report is a finding for Ockham's purposes. That is, users can absolutely depend on the fact that no bug reportfrom Infer  means that the procedure is bug-free ""subject to some idealistic and optimistic assumptions"", as @jberdine said.

Infer is welcome to participate in Ockham.

427,2016-08-16 17:09:36,"It is unclear how Infer's ""findings"" could be evaluated or validated.  For example, suppose that for a function `f` Infer computes a specification `{P} f(x) {Q}`.  If Infer is wrong, how can this be demonstrated?  It seems that it would finding a state that satisfies `P` from which executing `f(x)`, subject to Infer's idealistic and optimistic assumptions, either crashes or returns in a state that does not satisfy `Q`.  No mechanized way of doing this is known.  Do you have something else in mind?

We choose a test suite with known bugs. If Infer fails to report a bug, then it doesn't satisfy the SATE VI Ockham Criteria. 

I appreciate @jberdine and @jvillard responding to my inquiry. I'm a little surprised with what I perceive as the reluctant attitude. I should think the community would be excited to demonstrate the strengths of Infer. Thank you for your time and patience with me.

427,2016-08-18 10:07:18,"@brotherpaul143, Thanks for bringing this up, and I don't mean to be off-putting.  What you're interpreting as reluctance is more wariness, and the expectation that the reality of how gray questions of soundness and completeness are for tools like Infer undermines the viability of these sorts of exercises.  In particular, Infer uses both sound techniques and heuristics which are neither sound nor complete.  Additionally, Infer uses the classical logical notion of soundness, which seems to correspond more to what you term completeness.  Infer does not do any reasoning that fits what you term ""soundness"".  The other difficulty is that the logically robust reasoning that Infer does produces specifications that are used internally by Infer, but not directly reported to developers.  Evaluating the correctness of these specifications is nontrivial, since they are hypothetical statements with very involved premisses.
",jberdine,2016-09-19 21:57:58
427,2016-08-18 10:38:49,"@brotherpaul143 I think a good summary is that Infer comes from sound design principles, makes unsound compromises and heuristics where it makes sense. In particular, Infer tries to maximize the value given to developers, over soundness or completeness concerns.

Now that all the provisos are out of the way, the main question is whether, given these provisos, you think that the results will be useful for SATE V. I guess this is for you to assess.

427,2016-08-18 10:45:46,"As a side note, I like to split things up in 2 separate aspects: report rate and fix rate.
Report rate measures how many defects that exist, are reported.
Fix rate measures how many reported issues are fixed by developers.

The reason for split things up in this way is that: first, the developer is part of the picture, the source of the value judgement. So the focus is to issue reports that bring value to the developer, as measured by the developer's willingness to act on the reports.
This set-up includes the situation with type checkers, that over-report by definition, but have a perfect fix rate (developers address type errors in order to compile the code).

425,2016-08-04 12:08:24,"I want to write a custom checker for Java programs to process the contents of a `try...catch` block, specifically to perform some processing on the contents of the `catch` block.
From whatever code I read, I could figure out the following:
- `Cfg.Procdesc.iter_instrs do_instr proc_desc` iterates over the instructions of a procedure node in the CFG and executes `do_instr` on each instruction.
- `ProcAttributes.re` gives the name and type of variables captured in a procedure, as well as the Exceptions thrown by the procedure.
- `cg.re` contains functions regarding the parents and children of a node in the Call Graph.

What I want to know:
- How do I find out whether a certain line is enclosed within a `try` block, or is followed by a `catch` block?
- How do I find the `type` of the Exception being caught by the `catch`?
- How do I find whether a certain instruction is part of a `catch` block, or how do I find what instructions are present in a certain `catch` block?

This is going to be a bit cumbersome with our current checkers setup, but it can be done in a hacky way. Let me explain how to do this by modifying the `exec_instr` function in the checker [here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/checkers/liveness.ml).

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I say `maybe` in the second function because it will also report the end of a catch block early if the catch block contains a loop. But for your use-case of detecting empty catches, this should work just fine.

> How do I find the type of the Exception being caught by the catch?

For each exception type `e` caught by the catch block, there will be an instruction performing an `instanceof` check on `e` to decide whether to enter the catch block or not.

> How do I find whether a certain instruction is part of a catch block, or how do I find what instructions are present in a certain catch block?

I would use the utility functions above to know when you are in a catch block, then create a mapping from catch blocks to the instructions they contain.

Consider that an object of type `T` is null and is being dereferenced, within a `try...catch` that handles `NullPointerException`. Shouldn't this be treated differently from a case in which the `try...catch` doesn't handle the null dereference at all?

From how I see this, probably we can show a warning to the user, saying, `""Maybe you should handle this derefence properly, although the try...catch seems to be handling this.""`

If a project deliberately catches `NullPointerException`, Infer will produce a lot of unintended reports. For such projects (if they exist), a different message would help.

I suspect that it would be hard to implement that behaviour in infer: if `foo()` dereferences null, then infer will want to report on `foo()`. But maybe `foo()` is only called from inside `bar()`, which catches `Exception` or `NullPointerException`. Currently, infer has no way to know every context in which `foo()` is called prior to analysing `foo()`, so it would be hard to avoid reporting on `foo()`.

That said, as @martinoluca was saying in #422, such code patterns are dubious at best anyway.

`Procname` is a module for procedure names. A `Cfg` object contains the control-flow graph of all the functions defined in a given file, but by no means of all the procedures in a program. Those are stored on disk in infer-out/captured/.

The logic to analyse functions and in which order lives in ondemand.ml and interproc.ml. Roughly, Infer analyses each function independently. If a function `f()` calls another function `g()`, infer will go and analyse `g()` first (to get its pre- and post-conditions, called ""specs"", and store them on disk in infer-out/specs/), then go back to analysing `f()`. The only information that is kept around from one function to the other is its set of specs.

Being able to mark methods as throwing on certain conditions would be immense as well.

Looking at the page again, I think it would be great to support `@ParametersAreNonnullByDefault` annotation as well, as it also looks pretty useful.

And nothing in the ../infer/bin except inferTest.

Anyone can help on this? Thanks a lot.

When a function of this object is called (eg. `a.getObject().doSomething();`), infer does not trigger a warning for a possible NullPointerException. Is this the designed behaviour or is this an issue at my end? If this is the designed behaviour, is there a good way of ensuring such things don't pass on to production?
",chainani,2016-09-19 22:02:53
397,2016-07-20 10:17:00,"Can you provide a full minimal example that reproduces your issue? Shooting from the hip, you could add a `@Nullable` annotation to the return of your getter method so that Infer assumes it can return null.

More (speculative) details: When Infer doesn't know about a function for whatever reason (no implementation available, or Infer failed to analyse it), Infer will treat that function ""angelically"" and assume that eg it never returns null. This is done to prevent being too noisy. This may or may not be what's happening in your case, we'd need to see some code to know for sure.

Infer seems to give a false positive in terms of null pointer deference on the following example,

379,2016-06-09 08:57:04,"I've analysed the following code snippet with Infer:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Where 'a' is an already initialised array of integers. When I analysed the class that calls this function I saw that Infer's debug information in the captured folder outputs: 'precondition_not_met in call to update..' 

This warning can be removed by changing the function update to something like this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Which makes sense because if I look at the preconditions for the function update it requires that 'i', 'val' and 'this' point to allocated memory (and if I interpreted the output correctly) that 'this' has an object 'val$[number]' which is reachable from 'this' and represents the value 'a[i]'. 

If I would (try to) write it in separation logic, something like this: 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
1. There doesn't seem to be a relation between i and i' in the pre and postcondition, how does Infer infer this?
2. Can I draw the conclusion from this that Infer 'knows' about the array bounds, and finds that without the added check for the function update 'a[i]' may not be reachable?
3. The length of 'a' doesn't seem to matter, I believe because Infer applies an abstraction for loops and assumes that after a couple of correct loops it will work on loops for arbitrary size, or is this a wrong assumption and does Infer know something about the exact size of array's and lists?

Debug output:
(BigObject contains the array 'a' )

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
",wouter89,
379,2016-07-07 20:12:41,"Sorry to be so slow in answering your questions!

(1) I don't fully understand this. The precondition `{ i |-> _ * val |-> _ * this.a |-> j * ls(j,i') * i' |-> _  }` is one that you wrote by hand, not one that Infer produced, right? Infer doesn't introduce inductive `ls` predicates for arrays, so it has no notion of an `i'`.

(2) Yes, Infer knows to add proof obligations for array bounds, and this is indeed what results in the `PRECONDITION_NOT_MET`. Although Infer can report some basic array bounds errors (check out `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptionExample` in the tests), these errors are not reported by default because they tend to bit a bit noisy. You can ask Infer to report them by running with the `-nf` flag.

Even though these errors are off by default, Infer can run into situations where it encounters a `PRECONDITION_NOT_MET`. This means that the caller cannot satisfy the precondition for its callee, but it also doesn't know what the consequences of not satisfying the precondition are--will it result in an out of bounds access, a null dereference, or was the inferred precondition just not general enough?

(3) Infer only knows about the exact size of arrays, and even then only if the size of the array is a constant. In other cases, Infer does indeed apply abstraction in loops to compute pre/postconditions that are independent of the size of an array/list.

Hope this helps, am happy to clarify or answer more questions!

- You can generate .dot files representing the control flow graph of a source file (which will contain all procedures defined in that file) by running infer with the `--debug` option for Java, or the `--frontend-debug` option for the clang frontend (see `infer --help`). This creates one `infer-out/captured/<source file name>.<hash>/icfg.dot` file per source file, containing the cfg of that file. This file is in the [DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_%28graph_description_language%29) format. You can also run with `--debug` for either Java or clang and look at the generated html file in `infer-out/caputer/<source file name>.<hash>.html` and if you hover over `I` nodes (or click on them) you'll see the IR instructions executed at that program point.

- is Flow the Infer implementation for Javascript ?
",bitliner,
372,2016-05-26 22:40:26,"Flow and Infer are two unrelated projects. 

There is no generic documentation describing precisely how to extend Infer to a new languages. Basically, what needs to be done is to trans-compile the input source code into the Infer intermediate representation. The [Infer IR](https://github.com/facebook/infer/tree/master/infer/src/IR) is a low level description of types, expressions, instructions and control flow. The code of the intermediate representation is written in [Reason](https://facebook.github.io/reason/) which has a syntax close to Javascript. Reading the documentations of the `.rei` files, example: [Sil.rei](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/IR/Sil.rei) is a good way to understand how to write a new frontend.

There is currently one frontend for [Java](https://github.com/facebook/infer/tree/master/infer/src/java) and one for [Clang](https://github.com/facebook/infer/tree/master/infer/src/clang). They can be used ass input examples.

367,2016-05-25 09:16:12,"The taint analysis is an experimental feature that's still under development, but I can share a few details on what it can do now.
- The taint checks Infer does fall into two categories: security and privacy. Security checks ensure that user-controlled input does not flow to sensitive functions, and privacy checks ensure that sensitive user data does not escape to the outside.
- There are a few built in taint checks in the open-source version of Infer (most notably, the SSL hostname verification check), but you can also specify your own sources and sinks using the [`PrivacySource`](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/annotations/com/facebook/infer/annotation/PrivacySource.java), `PrivacySink`, `IntegritySource`, and `IntegritySink` annotations. Once you add these annotations, Infer will report source-sink flows between the annotations.
- At the theoretical level, the taint analysis works using the same bi-abduction technique that Infer uses to compute function pre and postconditions. When the analysis encounters a taint sink, it generates a proof obligation that flows into that sink are untainted, and it propagates that proof obligation into the precondition. When applying that precondition at a call site where the precondition cannot be met, Infer will report a warning.

Yes, there is a way to exclude certain directories. I'll illustrate it by example let me know if it works for you.
If your use case is different/more complex let me know as well.

Let's say I have a project with following directory structure.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

We have a way of providing extra information to guide the analyzer by .inferconfig file (it's in json format)

Step 1:
Create .inferconfig file (name is important) in `<ROOT>` directory

Step 2:
Add entry for `skip-clang-analysis-in-path` with list of all paths relative to `<ROOT>`.
.inferconfig file should look like this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Step 3:
Run infer from `<ROOT>` directory (it's important for infer to find .inferconfig file there). If you have to run infer from different directory, you have pass `--project-root` flag to your infer invocation. And that's all.

> Also how to speed up the analysis phase?

By excluding certain directories, we skip analyzing them at all which should speed up the whole analysis process. 
If you want to see reports in the code that you just changed, you can follow differential workflow described [here](http://fbinfer.com/docs/infer-workflow.html). It's much faster, but won't report problems in whole codebase.

But it really dosn't work when I check my java project,  the code is like this:

doc.classid is a private member and initialized from a xml in the constructed function, but [classid] in the xml maybe null. So, the code 'docvrid.equals(""10000103"")' maybe call a NullPointerException.

The version of infer I'm using is 0.8.0.
The command I ran infer is `infer -- ant`.

353,2016-04-26 04:53:39,"Hi @chen881129. Infer does not parse the xml files, so the information whether `doc.getClassid()` may  return `null` is not known. In this case, Infer will make optimistic assumptions about the code. Here, `docvrid` being dereferenced in `docvrid.equals(...)`, Infer will assumes that `docvrid != null`. If you know that `docvrid` can be null, you can annotate the code accordingly:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And Infer will then make the opposite assumption: `docvrid` will be considered as potentially `null` unless there is enough information to state otherwise. For instance:

353,2016-04-26 07:14:54,"Hello @jeremydubreil, very nice to receive your message.
You are right that Infer dose not know `docvrid` is null. Actually `docvrid` is not always null, it's potentially null. So, `docvrid != null && !docvrid.equals(""10000103"")` will be safe and `docvrid.equals(""10000103"")` without `docvrid != null` is dangerous.

In my opinion the dangerous code should be print. Can Infer print the potentially NullPointerException?

344,2016-04-21 10:12:10,"Thanks for the detailed question, @wouter89. What you are seeing is because infer doesn't do a global analysis of a class (in this case `NoNullDereference`) to figure out invariants (in this case ""`alwaysFalse` is always `false`""). To explain, let me try and go over your tests:
1. Infer analyses `test()` on its own (without looking at the context) and finds that it could dereference `null` if `alwaysFalse` is `true`. Since infer doesn't try to analyse the context of the method, only the method itself, it doesn't know that `alwaysFalse` cannot in fact be `true`. The analysis of `main()` shows no error.
2. Same as 1, except this time it turns out that `alwaysTrue` can indeed be `true` to this report turns out to be legit.
3. Infer analyses `test()` and finds no issue. It stores 2 specifications about `test()`: A) when `alwaysTrue` is `true` then the return value is `null`; B) otherwise it is `""hello""`. Infer then analyses `main()`. At the point where `main()` calls `test()`, the value of `nullDereference.alwaysTrue` is `true`, so infer uses specification A and then finds an error when simulating the execution of `null.trim()`.
4. Similar to 3, except than at the point where `main()` calls `test()` infer selects specification B and doesn't find any error when symbolically executing `""hello"".trim()`.
5. Infer analyses `test()` and finds no error because it knows which branch to take in `if (false) ...`.
6. Same as 5 and Infer correctly finds the NPE.

I hope this answers your question. Feel free to open another issue about the general fact that infer doesn't try to find out which fields never change before anaylising the methods in a class.

In this case Infer does report the NULL_DEREFERENCE  in the method that isn't in the class (even though the method in the class in the same).

344,2016-04-21 13:48:57,"C++ analysis is still experimental and unsupported for now. Infer doesn't analyse C++ code by default, so won't report on `A::test()`. You can pass `--cxx` to infer to switch the experimental C++ analysis on (you may need to upgrade to the current git version of infer first), like so: `infer --cxx -- clang++ -c foo.cpp`.

When analysing the following piece of code, Infer does report a memory leak when the file is saved as a C file and it reports no issues when the file is saved as a C++ file. I think Infer should also report a memory leak when this file is saved as C++.

336,2016-04-13 10:38:32,"Hi,

When running Infer I came across some odd behaviour I couldn't explain. I have made some small code examples to illustrate the problem without having to deal with the context.

**Sample 1**:
For this code Infer doesn't report a memory leak, even though the condition in the if statement will always evaluate to false and data will never be freed. Infer does recognise that the condition is always false, so the problem doesn't lies with evaluation of the conditional statement.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

**Sample 2** :
But, (strangely) Infer does report a memory leak for the following snippet of code.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I can't figure out why the code in **sample 2** does report a memory leak. The only difference between the code snippets is the return statement. I would like for Infer to also report the memory leak in **sample 1**. 

Can you explain why Infer behaves this way and if I need to add return statements to my code?
",wouter89,2016-04-14 16:32:35
336,2016-04-13 10:43:14,"Thank you for the report!

This seems to happen when the conditional is the last statement.
If you add another instruction, whether a return or something else, the leak will be reported.

We will fix this.

I can reproduce the error on a dummy example and the error goes away if I add `-fno-modules` to the clang arguments. Unfortunately if your project needs modules to compile then it's not a solution for you. 

Someone reported being able to selectively disable modules here: https://github.com/facebook/infer/issues/232#issuecomment-173378896

If someone knows how to pass this sort of options to xcodebuild from the command line then we can add them to infer.

334,2016-04-11 15:07:31,"Hi,

I'm trying to build Infer using the latest Ubuntu 16.04 LTS beta2 but the build process fails:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The package `atdgen` is installed and I'm able to run it via command line.

If I try to run the `opam` commands, the process fails when running the `opam install --deps-only infer`:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The stdout-file and stderr-file are both empty. This is the content of the env-file:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The libncurses-dev is installed. Actually I've installed every library related to ncurses trying to solve this dependency error:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I've installed all the suggested dependencies:

I've tried with both the latest github master and the 0.8.0 release tar ball.

334,2016-04-11 15:13:15,"What does `atgen -version` say?

Have you tried `opam depext conf-ncurses.1`? Looking at the [package](https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository/blob/master/packages/conf-ncurses/conf-ncurses.1/opam), it wants the `ncurses-dev` package on ubuntu, and the way to test whether it's installed is to check that `pkg-config ncurses` runs successfully (so `pkg-config ncurses; echo $?` should output 0).

Yes, I've tried:

But `pkg-config ncurses`  has no output at all and returns a 1:

Running `sudo pkg-config ncurses; echo $?` gives a 0 as result...

For some reason it seems that I need to **run `opam install --deps-only infer` as root**. As I said `pkg-config ncurses` return 1 if run as normal user.

333,2016-04-07 20:21:42,"Hello,

I'm attempting to use Infer to test an embedded project.  I know there are a number of null reference errors in the code, among other issues, but infer is not picking them up.  Since a large part of the code being run occurs only if an interrupt is generated, will this affect the ability of infer to test it correctly?  It's possible that the compiler is optimizing out large parts of the code simply because it appears unreachable in some way.

If I point infer at a single source file, other than the main.c file, will it analyse it correctly even if there is no main function?

Cheers,

David

How are you doing? And thanks for such wonderful tool.

Wondering if you could help to take a look at what happened when i tried to infer scan my Android project?

I've installed the infer v0.8.0 on my local Ubuntu, and i've setup my environment properly by execute the infer scan on the examples folder's android_hello project, which shows the expected results of detected 3 errors.

But when i've infer scan my Android project that it would show lots [system.err] and did not generate inferTraceBugs report.

my steps: (Alone doing the clean then build could build correct without problem)
1. ./gradlew clean
2. infer -- ./gradlew build

please help to check the infer output log files and please let me know if there's any missing step.
Thanks so much :+1:

Code like:

In this checker I am getting two kinds of false positives:
- **Methods that are annotated with @override** -- although I am checking whether a given method is overriding any method in one of its superclasses, this is not enough.
- **Methods that are being overridden by one of their subclasses** -- these methods cannot be converted to static.

For the first false positive I think I am getting close but if you could give me some hints it would be really helpful.

For the second, I have no clue... :worried:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

So, in this last case I don't want to flag `HelloSuper.shouldNotBeStatic` as a potential static method since it is not static so that it can be overridden by a subclass.
",luiscruz,2016-07-06 16:20:56
326,2016-04-11 21:28:26,"Regarding the @ override I thought about this because although I am checking whether the given method belongs to a superclass, I am still having false positives with methods that are overriding other methods.
Probably this happens in methods that implement interfaces. I have to double check this.

Is there a way of getting the interfaces that a given class (or `struct_typ`) implements?
",luiscruz,2016-07-06 16:20:56
326,2016-04-11 22:51:06,"`Prover.get_overrides_of` and `AndroidFramework.get_all_supertypes` could both be suitable for this, depending on exactly what you want to do.

326,2016-04-13 16:10:42,"Thanks @sblackshear.

I think `Prover.get_overrides_of` will get the job done for my second problem -- Methods that are being overridden by one of their subclasses.

Regarding my first problem -- Methods that are annotated with @ override -- I need to do this because I am having the following false positive. I.e., I am identifying that this method should be static:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I believe that since `android.widget.BaseAdapter` is not in the source code Infer is not able to retrieve it. Would `AndroidFramework.get_all_supertypes` fix this @sblackshear?

I tried it with no luck, but maybe I am doing something wrong. Just wanted to double check this with you.

I'm not sure about Java 8, though.

In this problem I need methods from superclasses. I have used `PatternMatch.proc_iter_overridden_methods` but it doesn't work for this particular case.

326,2016-04-14 12:32:47,"I've successfully used `Prover.get_overrides_of` to skip methods that are being override in subclasses. Thanks @sblackshear!

I still need to check whether a method is overriding a superclass method. I.e., I don't want to identify the method `getItemId()` in https://github.com/facebook/infer/issues/326#issuecomment-209526683 as a static candidate.
",luiscruz,2016-07-06 16:20:56
326,2016-04-14 19:12:36,"I think that you will probably need to write custom logic for this (but please do send a pull request, as this logic could be useful elsewhere!). 

Given a method `m`, I would look up its struct type `T` using `Tenv.proc_extract_declaring_class_typ`. Each `struct_typ` knows what its immediate superclasses and declared methods are. I would iterate through the declared methods of each supertype of `T` looking for methods `m_super` whose name is the same as `m` (for full precision, you'll have to check the the correct subtyping relationship holds on the parameters of `m` and `m_super` as well). This should be done recursively for all superclasses of `T` until you find a match. The code from `AndroidFramework.get_all_supertypes` might be useful to reuse/adapt for this.

I'm not making a pull request yet because I still need to clean aux methods, make some tests, etc. By the way, I still need to figure out how to unit test this.

For unit tests, I would add `tenvTests.ml` under `src/unit` and add your tests there (`procCfgTests` or `schedulerTests` are good examples to follow). We don't have a lot of unit tests so far, but are trying to add more as we write new code. You can run build unit tests using `make unit` and run them using `InferUnit`.

However, my Checker is detecting whether a method is a getter or setter by parsing the method name. I.e., methods starting with `get` or `set` and with 0 or 1 parameters, respectively, are accessors.

The problem with this approach is that there are many false positives. Some methods which name starts with `get` or `set`, do not strictly get or set one object's field.

I'm thinking that maybe add another restriction that considers the LOC of the method would fix the problem.

Is this possible with Infer Checkers? Is there a better framework for this problem? What do you think?

(Btw the location information can be accessed using `AttributesTable.load_attributes proc_name`, then look at field `ProcAttributes.loc`. Note though: the front-end start from bytecodes so the location information is not always 100% accurate).

I don't know of an accurate heuristic to detect getters and setters, but you can try and see if the one you have can be refined to the point of being useful.
Another possible observation, getters/setters tend to be very simple functions, so one could in principle look at the instructions in their implementation, and see if there are very few instructions, for some notion of `very few`. Look at the control-flow graph of the code you have, and see if code simplicity could be positively correlated.

Perhaps by LOC you mean simplicity.

So for each callee it's as if you were writing a new checker: start again from the procedure description.

When the callee is a simple getter, I would expect a start node, an exit node, and a node in the middle, with only a few instructions. (Plus an exceptions sink node. for collecting exceptions, I guess).

Given this source

here's the central node, between the start and the exit node:

For the method above, `getFoo()` I have the following representation

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I can see that `S_*` probably means a start node, `E_*` an exit node and `I_*` an instruction node. This is pretty similar to what I can get from the dot CFG when I run with checkers enabled:

Both outputs are really cool and really useful.
However, it is still hard for me to create patterns that match SIL based on this.

Example:
The following pattern matches with one of the instructions of node Procdesc `int Hello.getFoo()`

308,2016-03-21 18:24:13,"This would be great to have!

At a high level, what our Java frontend currently does is (for each invocation of `javac`, directly or by the build system):
(1) Start from the verbose output of `javac`, which lists the classpath, list of compiled source files, and produced bytecodes)
(2) Build a map from produced bytecodes to their source files
(3) Use Javalib (a third-party-library) to parse the produced bytecode
(4) Translate all of the Javalib-parsed bytecodes into SIL (Infer's intermediate language)

To support other JVM languages, it probably makes the most sense to add code for passing a JAR directly to step (3). Unfortunately, the logic for steps for (1) - (3) is not cleanly separated. It will likely require some refactoring before you can add the JAR option.

I would start from [here](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/java/jClasspath.ml#L161), which is what does steps (2) and (3). The first step would be separating out (3) so you can pass it a JAR directly. Then, we can work on the trickier problem of replicating (2): how do you get reliable source line/variable name information starting from bytecode :).

**Butter Knife 7**: `@Bind` was the same as `@InjectView` functionally, but `@Optional` was removed in favor of reusing `@Nullable` so the IDE would lint it. Same idea though. Behavior applies to fields and methods.

**Butter Knife 8+**: Unreleased, but behavior will be the same with fields. For methods however, `@Optional` was re-added because it was strange to require `@Nullable` for methods since many had `void` return types. Note that it's only allowed on methods however, fields must still use `@Nullable`

All in all: I think `bind` should be included as well then since its behavior is functionally the same and this only applies to fields.

Also there are some other new features in ButterKnife 7+ for resource value injection that should probably be there too, namely the following that bind reference types: 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Should they be added as well? They behave similarly in that they're null until `bind()` is called

299,2016-03-11 15:58:17,"Hi there,

In the scope of my PhD I want to create a tool that performs some code analysis to detect common energy bugs on Android applications.
Since Infer is a bug detection tool I would like to write my analysis code on top of Infer.

As a proof of concept I want to create a simple checker:
- Analyse logging behaviour in the app.  

According to Moura et al. (2015), energy efficiency can be improved by disabling logging in the app.

For that I would need to:

1- detect standard logging function calls (such as System.out.println)
2- learn custom logging functions implemented by the developer
3- detect whether logging functions are being called

This does not look trivial to me, but as a start I would like to implement item (1) detect standard logging function calls.
If I’m able to do this I will have green light to proceed with other checkers.

I took a look into the source and I started studying Checkers.

I understand that checkers have to be registered in the src/checkers/registerCheckers.ml. E.g.:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

So that java_checkers is a list like this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I understand that the first argument (`ImmutableChecker.callback_check_immutable_cast`) is the function that will be called to perform this particular check.
This function points to another `check_immutable_cast` with the following arguments:
- curr_pname
- curr_pdesc
- typ_expected
- tap_found_opt
- loc 

These arguments are useful to check implicit type casts and were provided by `Eradicate.callback_check_return_type`.
However if we need different information, I should process the following arguments:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This is being done in `callback_performance_checker`, but if I had some description of what are those variables and what can I do with them, it would make my life easier.
I see that there is some module to process procs descriptions (`Cfg.Procdesc.get_proc_name`), but I’m starting to get dizzy.

In addition, if you have any advice about the best way to implement this, I would be happy to hear about it.

299,2016-03-11 16:23:35,"Simpler checkers to look at (they are just sample checkers which are disabled by default) are in `checkers.ml`.
In particular:
- `callback_print_c_method_calls` prints every C/ObjC call. This can be simply adapted for Java to have a feeling for how it works.
- `callback_check_field_access` prints every access to a field `o.field`.

The parameter `proc_name` is the name of the function/method. Every checker, when active, is called once for each function.

The parameter `proc_desc` is the procedure description: this gives you access to the control flow graph for that procedure: so you can look at the nodes, flow edges, and the instructions on each node.
Both checkers above show how to iterate over all the instructions.
This is the simplest form of checker, where you just want to visit the instructions. It's a good starting point.

Another useful resource: instead of doing `infer -a checkers -- javac Test.java` one can use the `-g` option for debug: `infer -g -a checkers -- javac Test.java`. That will save extra information, such as the control flow graph for each file processed in dot format.

- `e_fun` is a constant to denote this specific function: `void PrintStream.println(String)`. The constant function is a `Cfun`.
- `args_ts` are the arguments of the function call: `n$0` and `n$1` with their respective types. These are variables of the intermediate language: their scope ends at `REMOVE_TEMPS`. In this case, `n$0` is `this`: in the intermediate language `this` is an explicit argument.
- `loc` is the location: the current file at line 13.
- `call_flags` specifies that the function is virtual. This will be true for any non-static java method.

I'm hoping to analyze our Android codebase with Infer, but have run into the aforementioned exception.

For context: we're currently using Java 8 in our codebase, made possible with [Retrolambda](https://github.com/orfjackal/retrolambda). I've seen the mentions in other issues (#249, #264, etc.) as to the lack of Java 8 support, so I imagine that this could be causing problems for Infer, though it's not entirely clear to me what the expected behavior should be with Retrolambda thrown into the mix, since, e.g., the post-Retrolambda'd bytecode should be Java 6-compatible.

Anyway--totally fine if the answer here is ""We don't support Java 8, nor do we support Retrolambda'd bytecode"".

Thanks in advance.

With Retrolambda, we write our code using a subset of Java 8 (we can use lambdas and method references, but no new APIs, for example), and Retrolambda then modifies the output bytecode to be Java 7-compatible.

So if Infer were determining a file's Java language level based on the output bytecode, I'd expect it to work on a codebase that was using Retrolambda? Alternatively, if Infer is skipping Java 8 files, isn't this error unexpected?

It should be modifying everything to be Java 7-compatible, since Android dex-ing only supports Java 7.

Note that this discussion is about java 8 features _in the code_. For instance, it's perfectly fine to take code that is compatible with java 7 (eg, anything targetting android), and compile it using java 8 to be analysed by infer.

In the context of this issue, if Infer catches the code after retrolambda has transformed it, then it shouldn't crash. @crm416: what steps are you using to analyse your project with retrolambda + infer?

",jvillard,2016-03-21 14:48:12
286,2016-03-20 20:40:18,"@jvillard -- Sorry for the delay. Appreciate all the activity in this thread.

To analyze my project, I was just using the recommended flow: `infer -- ./gradlew assembleDebug`.

With Retrolambda in the mix, the Android build process is something like:
- Run `javac` over your source files to produce Java 8 bytecode.
- Retrolambda transforms the bytecode to be Java 6/7 compatible.
- `dx` transforms the transformed bytecode into a `.dex` file.

I believe that Infer relies on the `javac` output from the gradle build process (please correct me if I'm mistaken--certainly no expert here), so maybe the issue is that it's using the pre-transformed bytecode.

(I'll try to put together a minimal example.)

Two quick asides, though:
1. It's unclear to me if this is worth fixing right now, since I imagine that a lot will have to change with the introduction of [Jack](http://developer.android.com/preview/j8-jack.html) (already available in the N developer preview), which will make some Java 8 language features standard in Android (backwards compatible to Gingerbread) and will remove the `javac` step from the Android build process.
2. Not relevant to this particular issue, but... it's interesting to me that Infer operates on bytecode, yet it ties in so well with annotations, which (I believe?) are stripped out by the time you get to bytecode (again, please correct me if I'm wrong). Are there any resources around for learning more about how that works?

286,2016-03-20 21:05:42,"Woo! I was actually able to run Infer over my project with `infer -- ./gradlew compileDebugJavaWithJavac` (or `infer -- ./gradlew assembleDebug`). It's successfully skipping over files with Java 8 language features.

Is this a result of the recent 0.8.0 release?
",crm416,2016-03-21 14:48:12
286,2016-03-21 14:48:12,"Thanks for the detailed update @crm416. Skipping Java 8 files and not crashing is the expected behaviour, there's a fix in 0.8.0 to reintroduce it.

For infer to be able to analyse code compiled with retrolambda, one of these two things needs to happen:
1. Java 8 support is added to Infer (#314)
2. Support for starting from the bytecode instead of from the Java source is added to Infer (#308)

1 is planned, and there's nothing stopping 2 in principle, since our Java frontend already starts from Java bytecode (only some rearchitecturing is needed to be able to not start from the sources).

I'm closing this issue since it's been resolved. Use the other two issues to track progress on the larger issue of dealing with Java8 bytecode.

283,2016-02-20 03:28:05,"This error comes from [`DB.source_file_equal (Exe_env.get_source exe_env pname) source_file`](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/inferanalyze.ml#L526).

The exact bug point is the function [`DB.rel_source_file_from_abs_path`]().
When the function with ""/"" parameter `DB.rel_source_file_from_abs_path ""/"" ""/root/a.c""`, then it returns `Relative ""/root/a.c""`.

I will explain how this bug make Infer skip analyzing procedures when run Infer on ""/"".

When I run Infer on `/` directory, then the `source_file` type is '[Absolute](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/DB.ml#L19)'. However, `(Exe_env.get_source exe_env pname)` returns '[Relative](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/DB.ml#L20)' type value, because of [DB. rel_source_file_from_abs_path](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/DB.ml#L53) returns 'Relative' type value.
Thus, it causes '0 active procedures' in [created clusters](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/inferanalyze.ml#L532), and analyzer does not analyze procedures in a source file.
I will explain how code set `source_file` as 'Absolute' type value, and set `(Exe_env.get_source exe_env pname)` as 'Relative' type value.

At first, the result of `DB.source_file_to_string source_file` and `DB.source_file_to_string (Exe_env.get_source exe_env pname)` is same string, as absolute path form string, when I run Infer on / directory
So I checked the reason of returning false, and the type of `source_file` is 'Absolute', and the type of `(Exe_env.get_source exe_env pname)` is 'Relative'.
It is natural that the type of  `source_file` is 'Absolute', because of the variable comes from [`this line`](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/inferanalyze.ml#L512), (the `source_file` is set by a function [`ClusterMakefile.source_file_from_pname`](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/inferanalyze.ml#L512) and the function calls the function [`DB.source_file_from_string`](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/DB.ml#L42)).

However, type of the result of `(Exe_env.get_source exe_env pname)` is 'Relative', so I followed code to find an origin of the `(Exe_env.get_source exe_env pname)`.
The value `exe_env` is set from [this statements](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/inferanalyze.ml#L908-L909), and more specifically, [this statement](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/inferanalyze.ml#L748).
I traced more code to find specific values in exe_env, and I found [`load_from_file` function](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/exe_env.ml#L87) which loads cg values from serialized file.

Thus I try to find call sites of the function [`store_to_file` which is pair with `load_from_file`](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/cg.ml#L325-L343), and the call sites are following,
- [in clang/cFrontend.ml](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/clang/cFrontend.ml#L163).
- [in java/jMain.ml](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/java/jMain.ml#L105).
- [in llvm/lMain.ml](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/llvm/lMain.ml#L55).
- [in harness/inhabit.ml](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/harness/inhabit.ml#L292).

As a result of this long code trip, I finally found [a line which causes this bug, in function `DB.rel_source_file_from_abs_path`](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/DB.ml#L54) which is called in the above `store_to_file` call sites.
The call sites of `store_to_file` call the vulnerable function `DB.rel_source_file_from_abs_path` to prepare `cg`.
The prepared `cg` is stored using `Cg.store_to_file` function, and it is loaded by `Cg.load_from_file` function, and it makes `DB.source_file_equal (Exe_env.get_source exe_env pname) source_file` statement returns false, which is cause of this bug.

Could the instructions be updated to say there's a perl-Digest-SHA requirement (at least on Linux) and that opam dependencies might need a different name to the one displayed?

We'll change the error message when `shasum` is not present, good catch!

The second problem you raise is fixed in master (the script now suggests `opam pin add --yes --no-action infer .`), but isn't included in a release yet.

273,2016-02-09 16:54:32,"Hi.  I am trying to write a tool which will interface with infer to provide bug reports.  One step in this integration is that I would like to be able to take in and process the json bug report.  I see that there is a schema https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/b1d77e54aaa9eca5af04139d60bfd171e112e089/infer/src/backend/jsonbug.atd

Is this likely to remain stable?  Also, is there any documentation as to the values that can appear in the json.  For example, what values are possible for:

  bug_class : string;
  kind : string;
  bug_type : string;
  qualifier : string;
  severity : string;

- `bug_class` is for development purposes.
- `kind` is either `""ERROR""`, `""WARNING""`, or `""INFO""`: https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/lib/python/inferlib/issues.py#L30-L32
- `bug_type` is one of the errors listed here: https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/src/backend/localise.ml#L31-L68, although a lot of these are not reported by default. The ones not filtered out are listed in the python toplevel: https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/infer/lib/python/inferlib/issues.py#L35-L50
- `qualifier` is a free-form string describing the bug, eg, `""pointer s last assigned on line 13 could be null and is dereferenced at line 14, column 3""`.

255,2016-02-04 19:02:32,"@tonycosentini: Unfortunately, you cannot use Infer and Eradicate using the same out directory because the analysis data are not compatible. This is not a theoretical limitation but it will require a good amount of changes to support this use case. Is it possible in your setting to just make a copy of `infer-out` after `infer -a capture` and before running the analysis ?

Besides, I think that the `-i` option is not compatible with running the analysis in two steps using:

  `infer -a capture --`

followed by:

  `infer -- analyze`

Is the approach or running:

  `infer -i -a eradicate -o eradicate-out -- ...`

and independently:

  `infer -i -a infer -o infer-out -- ...`

blocking for you ?

We were hoping to do one capture to cut down on time. We can split it up though.

It would be nice to fail when using `-i` incorrectly - it's kind of hard to tell what is supported and what is not (I can give this a try, should be somewhat easy since it's in the Python code).

  Thanks for this report and your others. Unfortunately, you have run into one of the dark corners of Infer: our Java 8 support. The frontend we use to parse Java bytecodes is a third-party library that does not yet support Java 8 (we are working on encouraging the maintainers to add support or do it ourselves). As a result, some classes may parse incorrectly, and some may fail to parse altogether. I will look into this issue and see if it is something unrelated to Java 8, but just a heads-up that anything using Java 8 can lead to strange results.

How are u ??  ^  ^ 

I just post error issue here because it seems like there is no where else to post this issue about. 

I just started to use infer from yesterday, and I made cool environment for launching Infer.

and When I launch infer, too many unknown type  name errors.. like below..

/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator9.2.sdk/usr/include/sys/types.h:95:9: error: unknown type
      name 'u_int64_t'

/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator9.2.sdk/usr/include/sys/_types.h:56:9: error: unknown type
      name '__int32_t'

/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator9.2.sdk/usr/include/machine/_types.h:34:2: error: 
      architecture not supported

/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator9.2.sdk/usr/include/sys/cdefs.h:707:2: error: Unsupported
      architecture

and so on...
...
..

my app is only run on iPad series , and target SDK is over iOS 6.0. and base sdk is iOS9.

Valid Architectures :  arm7, arm7s, arm64 
Build Active Architectures Only  : NO

I commanded like this : infer -- xcodebuild -target myTarget -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator

.
.
any idea why  those so many errors occur ??

Thanks in advance !

Does `xcodebuild -target myTarget -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator` succeed on its own?

Can you paste the contents of `infer-out/toplevel.log`? Please use something like https://gist.github.com/ or pastebin et al. for text pastes as it will preserve formatting.

If I understand correctly, you get the same error running `xcodebuild -target myTarget -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator`. This means that this is not the right command to build your project. You first need to figure out how to compile your project from the command line. Then use `infer -- <your command here>` to run infer.

235,2016-01-07 12:42:00,"Hello @bkangtf,
if the original command you provided fails:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Then it may be that the `iphonesimulator` SDK doesn't support the required architecture.
Try running

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

and see if works, then try running infer with it.

Thanks.

  Warning: you are not using a release of Infer. The C and
  Objective-C analyses require a custom clang to be compiled
  now. This step takes ~30-60 minutes, possibly more.

  To speed this along, you are encouraged to use a release of
  Infer instead:

  http://fbinfer.com/docs/getting-started.html

  If you are only interested in analyzing Java programs, simply
  run this script with only the ""java"" argument:

  ./build-infer.sh java

Are you sure you want to compile clang? (y/N) y

@shenruisi, can you run `./autogen.sh` and paste the output here?

Also, regarding #230 my opinion is that it would be easier for you to simply get rid of the rogue `.git/` directory that must be somewhere up of where you unpacked the release of infer, then build infer from the release, as it's much faster than starting from git.

231,2016-01-06 10:29:11,"@cegonya thanks for your report. This is indeed the intended workflow: `./build-infer.sh` tells you how to install the opam dependencies. `opam pin add --yes --no-action .` should have created the ""infer"" package that opam is complaining about in your message about `opam install --deps-only infer`.

See #222 for a discussion about how to improve the docs around this.

231,2016-01-06 14:31:47,"@jvillard thank you for this information. Definitely, you need to update that documentation for required Opam modules.

It looks like you're inside an unitialised git repo for some reason. You can run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to find out the root of the repo. You probably don't want that so you can either remove the `.git/` repository located at `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, or unpack infer somewhere else, eg `/tmp`.

We'll fix this soon so that the build works even in this case, thanks!

The idea here was that `./build-infer.sh` would tell you what to do in this situation: if the opam packages are missing, it fails with the following message:

Perhaps the last two commands can be added to the document instead of your opam command? The (small) advantage is that this is guaranteed to remain in sync with the [opam file](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/45813c3/opam). Also, please add the same commands to the MacOS instructions.

This is where I got a doubt that when Apple itself is poviding options in its IDE, Why are we going for Infer? Even in Infer FAQ page, I have seen like ""On iOS there is the Clang Static analyzer. Infer does some things different, in particular reasoning that spans across multiple files. But CSA checks for more kinds of issues and is also more mature than Infer when it comes to iOS"" Please provide details on the same with the extra fetures that are povided by Infer compared to Clang.

Thanks!

About the ""Failed to run InferAnalyze binary, exiting"" error, you have to compile the binaries of Infer first, please follow the instructions [here](http://fbinfer.com/docs/getting-started.html).

About Eclipse, there's no plugin to run Infer from the UI, but you can still run Infer on your source code through the command-line. If your project builds with gradle, and the task to build it is `build`, then you can simply run the following command:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Same rule applies to other build systems like buck, maven, ant and make.

191,2015-10-28 11:18:41,"I have a question relating to modelling. I would like to model an api in order to check with infer that it is used correctly, i.e., that certain methods are called with non-null parameters. This seems to be done for java.lang.System.getProperty(String s) by de-referencing the parameter s by calling s.length() in the model of the method. 

Below is a simple model of ArrayList (the purpose of the model is just to illustrate the problem). It uses the approach above for the add-method, but it doesn’t work. When running in debug mode, I get “SKIP_FUNCTION boolean ArrayList.add(Object)” in the generated html-file. However, the call to iterator() is not skipped and works correctly according to the model.

public abstract class ArrayList<T> {

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

}

Do you have any advice for debugging this issue further? Is the model that I have even sufficient for infer to find the method add, since I have omitted the inherited classes and implemented interfaces (it doesn’t seem to make a difference)?

Then the model provided for `List.length()` will not be used in the call to `foo(l)` in `bar`.

  Retain cycle involving the following objects:  (1) an object of class MBProgressHUD  retaining another object via instance variable _delegate,  (2) object self retaining self._HUD,   at line 611, column 5

The application is called aMenjar and its Github location can be found at https://github.com/maurovc/aMenjar.

The 1st bug is between the class AMQRPedidoViewController (self) that has a property of type MBProgressHUD (a strong pointer), MBProgressHUD has a property delegate that is set to AMQRPedidoViewController at line 638 stated. The pointer to the delegate is a weak pointer. So according to the documentation, if 2 objects are pointing to each other, and one of them is strong pointer and the other is a weak pointer, then a retain cycle does not exist as eventually, one of the object can be released and thus the other will be released.

The 3rd bug is the same as the 1st bug

The 2nd bug is for the class AMQRPedidoViewController having a property named btnDer of type UIBarButtonItem. This is a weak pointer from the self object to btnDer. In UIBarButtonItem, there is a target property that can be set. In line 744, [self.btnDer setTarget:self]; is called, hence setting AMQRPedidoViewController as the target of btnDer. Though the target property in UIBarButtonItem is a weak pointer. So the retain cycle does not establish between 2 weak pointers as no ownership is present for both objects.

I think that the bugs reported maybe false alarm, but let me know otherwise if I was incorrect.

Many thanks for your help.

The potential fix: add `u` before `'{0}:{1}: {2}: {3}\n  {4}\n'.format(` like so:

162,2015-08-13 10:07:15,"I suspect what's happening in your case is that the makefiles are running the compiler providing an absolute path rather than a relative one. In this case Infer won't be able to capture the compile commands (because it does it by changing the PATH environment variable, which won't be effective in this case).

Usually you can replace the compilers on Makefiles setting variables like CC and CXX: try setting those to point to your compiler, but without specifying the absolute path. If there's a `configure` step that generates these makefiles, then run it again setting those variables first.

Thanks.

thanks for your suggestion, i have still two questions
first.   how infer change the PATH environment variable, i echo the $PATH and found it is appended the cross-compile tool directory, is it enough

echo $PATH

second.   there is no 'configure' step in the project, can i know how many environment variables infer need to use, so that i can check if they are useful?  i don't know how infer capture the process of compile.
",b0207191,2015-09-01 13:54:57
162,2015-08-19 08:35:10,"because the project use cross compile,so i wonder if i should set change $CC to the dest-$CC at first.
so i setup the $CC ,then excute '../facebook-clang-plugin/clang/setup.sh'

the compile stop at
configure: error:
The selected GCC C++ compiler is not new enough to build LLVM. Please upgrade
to GCC 4.7. You may pass --disable-compiler-version-checks to configure to

so i added '--disable-compiler-version-checks' to 'setup.sh'

162,2015-08-19 08:52:36,"Hi @b0207191,

You probably don't need to use dest-$CC to compile infer and the facebook-clang-plugins. (The error you get is because your dest-$CC is indeed too old)

The Makefile you pasted does not seem to contain any build rules, it just calls other Makefiles. To be able to help, it would be great to see an example invocation of the compiler as called by your Makefiles.

One possibility for your issue is if your Makefile gives several source files to $CC at once. Infer cannot deal with this. For instance, `infer -- gcc -c a.c b.c` does not work. Instead, one should use `infer -- gcc -c a.c && infer -- gcc -c b.c`. I realise now that we seem to have forgotten to document this!

162,2015-08-20 01:05:23,"@jvillard 
yes,the project do the compile by call 'makefile' in every directory Recursively 

one 'makefile' look like this:

include $(top_srcdir)/Rules.mk

LIB_CLI_VER := 1.0.0
DLIB_FLAGS = -fPIC -shared -lpthread -lrt
TAG := xxx.so
ELF := $(TAG).$(LIB_CLI_VER)
SRC := $(shell find -name '_.c')
DEPEND = $(shell find -name '_.d')
OBJ = file1.o   file2.o .... filen.o

%.o: %.c
    $(CC) -c -fPIC $(CFLAGS) -Wall $< -o $@

.PHONY: build install clean
all: build install

build: $(TAG)
$(TAG): $(OBJ)
    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(DLIB_FLAGS) $^ $(IMAGES)/lib/fsui.a -o $(ELF)

install:
    mkdir -p $(install_sodir)
    cp -p $(ELF) $(install_sodir)
    cd $(install_sodir) && ln -sf $(ELF) $(TAG)

clean:
    rm -rf  $(OBJ) $(ELF) $(DEPEND)

include $(SRC:.c=.d)

%.d: %.c
    set -e; rm -f $@; \
    $(CC) -M -MT $_.o $(CFLAGS) $< > $@.$$$$; \
    sed 's,($_).o[ :]*,\1.o $@ : ,g' < $@.$$$$ > $@; \
    rm -f $@.$$$$

i think gcc in the makefile execute as 'gcc -c file1.c gcc -c file2.c', but not 'gcc -c file1.c file2.c'??

162,2015-08-20 14:38:49,"My hunch was wrong, it looks like you are compiling files one by one, which is good.

Looking back at your comments, I see another possibility. You mentioned this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

If `$CC` is set to something other than gcc or clang, Infer will not be able to capture calls to the compiler, because it only looks for calls to gcc and clang, and not eg i486-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc.

Can you try the following? (replacing `xxx` with your usual target)

well, although i can try 'infer -- make CC=clang xxx', i haven't all the codes in the project, the code of mine need to link other .so(dynamic library) of other components , so the log occur in linking parse:

---

## /usr/bin/ld: skipping incompatible build/prj_nic-x86-32/images/rootfs/lib/libxxx.so when searching for -lxxx

i think if i want to use infer, i should get all the code of project, then use 'infer -- make CC=clang xxx' to make all the code from the head.

162,2015-08-26 11:03:32,"Because Infer uses a custom compiler under the hood, it is common for the linking step to fail (see [the FAQ](http://fbinfer.com/support.html#quot-infer-lt-build-command-gt-quot-fails-during-a-linking-step)).

thank you for advise all above. 
i made a try under 32bit-ubuntu enviroment and had successfully to run infer the project inspite there are most false positive in result.

by the way, can infer now only detect null pointer reference and memory(resouce) leak ?
i think since its working manner is similiar to coverity, it should discover many bugs in the future.

You need a specific version of facebook-clang-plugins to compile infer. Usually the latest version of the plugin does not work with infer. You can find which version of the facebook-clang-plugins you need in [dependencies/clang-plugin/clang-plugin-version.config](https://github.com/facebook/infer/blob/master/dependencies/clang-plugin/clang-plugin-version.config).

For instance, to compile the current infer master, you need https://github.com/facebook/facebook-clang-plugins/archive/3a4b470518da7251f2dc296444c4d616fef5dc2c.zip.

The easiest way to get the right version of the plugin is to simply remove your current facebook-clang-plugins/ directory and run `./update-fcp.sh` from inside infer, which will get the right version for you.

One option I have could be to exclude the beans from Infer and provide an auto-generated model in it's place, but the problem with that is that it will be used for all occurrences of the bean rather than just the places where it is validated.

A possible approach is to run Infer on the CI as it is, keeping the exit code 0 for a successful analysis, and create the exist code as a separate step:

118,2015-06-30 15:16:52,"hi GeemMin,

Your question is interesting and it does not have a definite answer. But let me give you a bit of context.

Static analysis is an undecidable problem, therefore there are no algorithmic methods that can solve it perfectly for every instance. For this theoretical reason, all static analysis tools are obliged to use some heuristic algorithms trying to find an approximate solution to the problem.  Heuristics are imprecise 
therefore all existing static analyzers are imprecise. They work well in some programs and less well in others. 
That said, every static analyzer has its own heuristic and internal engine and therefore they will always
be differences in their results. One will find something and another wiill find something else. 
Sometimes two different analyzers find the same bug. But there is no general rule that can tell you 
who can find what. In general we can only make predictions. 
So even if on the surface two different analyzers say that they find the same category of bugs 
(for example null pointer dereference) in reality, their heuristic normally would fire in different situations.
For this  reason many large companies employing static analysis use more than one  analyzer on the same code to discover the same category of bugs.

A good article comparing different existing analyzers is the following:
http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/TD/td3202/32_02-Pendergrass-Lee.pdf

I hope this helps!

Infer finds the NPEs in those examples, but by an error in our filtering system, they end up in bucket B5 which we don't show by default because those bugs are less likely to be real. We will work on fixing this.

It looks like what you get from malloc(0) is implementation dependent, and it is always safe to pass that result to free. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8808303/c-freeing-malloc0.

112,2015-08-26 11:41:59,"@guafei the way Infer works is by following what the build system of your project does, so to prevent Infer from analysing c++ files, you have to modify your build system to not compile them.

Or you can try this untested trick:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This will hardcode the c++ compiler to be, eg, /usr/bin/clang++ instead of just clang++. This will prevent Infer from replacing clang++ with its own clang and make this step essentially invisible to Infer.

Regarding compilation errors - are you using non-english locale? If you do, please fetch newest code because https://github.com/facebook/infer/pull/94 might help you.

You could also try using our prebuilt binaries if you just want to try out infer:

107,2015-06-26 14:39:19,"It looks like `NSUserDefaults+App.h` is one of the files of your project, not a system header. Is this correct?

If so, you should add `-Ipath/where/NSUserDefaults+App.h/lives` to your clang command. You will probably need to include multiple directories in the same way. It will be easier to use Infer on your whole project, using a command that successfully builds your project.
",jvillard,2015-07-14 11:53:20
107,2015-06-29 09:19:27,"@jvillard this alls appears with system headers like UIKit or Foundation.h. I agree that the best use here is to build the whole project via the infer command. @dulmarod yes, both xCode and command line tools are installed, Cocoapods is also used within the project.
",emkou,2015-07-14 11:53:20
107,2015-07-08 11:02:01,"Hello @emkou,
As @jvillard said, `NSUserDefaults+App.h` doesn't look like a system header, so I'd proceed as he suggested, by passing to Clang the path where this file lives, using the `-I` argument.

More in general, when `xcodebuild` builds each file of your codebase, it passes to Clang more arguments than just the source filename, and among those there's the `-isysroot` one, which tells Clang where your SDK lives.
For example, your iPhoneSimulator SDK should be located in:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

try passing `-isysroot <SDK_PATH>` to your Clang command.

",GeekMin,2015-06-30 16:48:20
105,2015-06-25 14:29:44,"Could you please explain to me better what is the problem?
Normally, observer needs to be released with CFRelease(observer), that's what Infer is pointing out. 
I don't think that that changes if the variable is static, but maybe I'm wrong. 
If you are not sure, you could just add CFRelease(observer) in the place where Infer gives the warning to be on the safe side.
",dulmarod,2015-06-30 16:48:20
105,2015-06-29 04:18:04,"Normally, giving the warning there is right...
but here, g_IMService is treated as ""singleton"", so the coder wanna the observer alive along with my process ... so see it as the false-positive, am I right?
",GeekMin,2015-06-30 16:48:20
105,2015-06-30 16:24:07,"I checked with an expert and he said that, yes, you are right that because you are using a singleton there won't be a leak. So you can leave your code unchanged, but from the static analyser's perspective, you cannot know that init will only be called in that context. If you extend your program with a non-static call to init, then there will be a leak. So Infer is correct here to report the leak.

",dulmarod,2015-06-25 09:39:53
103,2015-06-24 15:33:19,"I am getting this RETAIN_CYCLE (type names and instance variables renamed to show weak/strong):

Retain cycle involving the following objects:  (1) an object of class TYPE_A  retaining another object via instance variable _varForWeakPropertyInA,  (2) an object of class TYPE_B  retaining another object via instance variable _varForStrongPropertyinB,  (3) an object of class TYPE_C  retaining another object via instance variable _varForWeakPropertyInC,   

So, in this cycle, two of the instance variables are for weak properties.  One thing that might be causing the problem is that the properties are declared this way in the `@interface` in the .h

`@property (nonatomic, readonly, weak) T *varForWeakPropertyInC;`

And, then in an anonymous category in the .m, it is changed like this:

`@property (nonatomic, weak) T *varForWeakPropertyInC;`

We do this to allow the class to write to its own property, but only expose a readonly property to other classes.  It's weak in both cases for both variables (I checked).

The actual code is hard to include with all of its context, but I can try to find a minimal example if you think weak properties work properly.  I can say that I am doing this on a very large codebase with tons of `weak` and block usage and this was the only RETAIN_CYCLE it found in the entire app (so I think it might be particular to this code).

103,2015-06-24 15:46:03,"hi  loufranco,

Infer normally understands the ""weak"" keyword and it should not report. It may be some corner case. 
If you could make a small example that reproduce the problem we'll try to see what's going wrong 
on that case.

I had thought that you were still stuck with Hello.java.

In my case, verbose output contained characters that the lexer did not expect, which caused parsing errors.

Yup, that's a good solution too, but this is available _now_. I would also bet there are more people on Node.js than Homebrew because a lot of popular front-end tools are built on Node.js. Choice doesn't hurt either.

Yes. It works on any Node.js supported platform (meaning most, including Windows), but only binaries for OS X and Linux are officially available for now, so it's limited to those platforms.

90,2015-06-22 11:06:57,"When analysing some simple linked list C code I found that infer would either fail to generate any specs for some functions, or would only provide specs for short, fixed-length lists.  After some debugging, I found that the backend sometimes fails to detect recursive fields in `struct`s because the type comparison relies on the fields in the struct type having the same order.  The clang frontend produces `struct` types with the fields in the declared order, but parts of the backend sort them and `sil.mli` says they should always be sorted.

For example, in the following code

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I get specs for `add1` where the fields are in alphabetical order, but not for `add2`.

This means that Infer didn't find any file to analyse in your project. You should run Infer on a cleaned version of your project. Try running something like this before running Infer:

(adapt this command to your own project)

Follow the guide and try running `xcodebuild` with the correct set of arguments first, then as soon as you find the right configuration, try using `infer --` with it.

I suspect the problem is related with the fact that in the presence of CocoaPods, you should use the xcworkspace and not the xcodeproj; please try running a command like this (customize according to your project):

As usual, please make sure the command itself works as expected, then run it with `infer --`

Run gradlew clean in between Infer runs.
./gradlew clean
This causes gradle to recompile everything each time, and subsequently Infer to capture all the files again.

then try 
infer -- ./gradlew build

or 
Run Infer in incremental mode.
infer --incremental -- ./gradlew build

If someone wants to work on this, I expect that there is a bit of work to do to generalize the build scripts to work on (even one of the ~6 OCaml ports for) windows.  Building the dependencies will likely involve some work.  After that, some of the build system integration implementations rely on a posix environment, but the degree of dependence varies (e.g. high for 'make', low for 'buck').  So depending on which build system you need, there is some work there.  Finally, the core of infer itself has very little reliance on posix, and in various points (e.g. interaction with signals) basic windows support is there (though untested).  If your use case allows using WSL or cygwin, then there might be very little work needed at all.  Pull requests most welcome.",jberdine,

I see from your command line that you are running Infer using the `--debug` option.
`--debug` is telling Infer to emit extra internal information during the analysis and this will make it slower than usual.
If you're interested on the internals of Infer and you want to look at the translation information generated during the analysis, then there's nothing wrong with your analysis instance, you should just wait for the analysis to finish (it may take some time, depending on the size of your codebase).

In case you're just interested in what bugs Infer finds on your code, then you should just remove the `--debug` option and let the analysis run.

Make sure you `./gradlew clean` before running it again, to make sure Infer captures all the compilation commands.

`update-fcp.sh` downloads a separate repository (facebook-clang-plugin) into the parent directory of the infer repository.  Running the setup file in this directory can fail, because facebook-clang-plugin contains a gzipped archive of an autoconf'd `llvm`, which can't account for spaces in the prefix dir path (the `facebook-clang-plugin` repository directory, in this case).  This appears to be an autotools problem.

Rather than update the gzipped archive in the facebook-clang-plugin repository, it seems reasonable to control where that dependency is auto-downloaded to.

Infer analysis for clang based source-code requires the use of clang plugins, and plugins don't work with Apple's clang.

It appears as though the facebook-clang-plugin is an actual copy of clang and targets x86-64 ? So, I likely need to build infer from source and build with it?

If you add the [following parameter](http://oclint-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/xctool.html#running-xctool-with-json-compilation-database-reporter) to 
* `xctool`: `-reporter json-compilation-database:compile_commands.json` 
* `xcpretty`:  `-r json-compilation-database -o compile_commands.json`

#### This'll enable you to use one of the following commands: 
Depending on how you generate this file you use one of the following options:
*  `xcpretty` and `xctool`: `--clang-compilation-db-files-escaped` 
    * reason: the files in the json are escaped : 'file\\ with\\ spaces'
* `cmake`: `--clang-compilation-db-files`

Granted, it'd be a 2 step process, but it'll work 👍 

**NB** Commonly, the build output will be stored in a file called 'xcodebuild.log'. If you need a different reporter for e.g. your test, you can still do that, generate the `compile_commands.json` using that log file, and launch infer using that generated `compile_commands.json`

Concretely:
1. `xctool.sh --<whatever parameters you need> -reporter json-compilation-database:compile_commands.json` or `xcodebuild --<whatever parameters> | tee xcodebuild.log | xcpretty -r junit -o junit.xml` as usual
2. `cat xcodebuild.log | xcpretty -r json-compilation-database -o compile_commands.json &> /dev/null`
    * the last part pipes the output  to `/dev/null`, as otherwise it'd be displayed on screen again, convoluting your build log.
3. `infer --skip-analysis-in-path Pods --clang-compilation-db-files-escaped compile_commands.json`

Here is an example of how to use it. When a variable with the attribute goes out of scope the function specified with the cleanup attribute will be called. The typical usecase is for free'ing the variable. This saves us from manually freeing in all error cases etc.

  You are not doing anything wrong--looks like there's an issue with Infer's Gradle support. The Gradle wrapper is quite primitive and just looks for calls to `javac` in the verbose output for Gradle. For some reason, these calls do not appear for your `compileJava` rule (I suspect it has something to do with the `ant options?).

I was able to get a little further by bypassing Gradle with `find src/main/ -name *.java | xargs infer -- javac -cp .:lib/*` from `bixie/tool/`, but then I ran into #3. We're working on fixing both that and the Gradle problem; thanks for the report!
