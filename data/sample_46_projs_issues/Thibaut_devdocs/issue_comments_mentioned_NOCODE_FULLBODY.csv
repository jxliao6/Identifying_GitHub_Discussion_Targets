> I've tried to include all packages and it's working fine for me, I don't experience any slow down. They are 217 types and 46 084 entries in 4 733 files occupying 153 MB.

I'm not too worried about the speed of the search. Even with 100k entries it seems to be holding up pretty well (I did a lot of optimization a while back).

However, I'm worried about search results becoming noisy / less useful due to the 46k entries, and increasing the chance that users will hit the IndexedDB quota and lose their offline data (until browsers implement the [Storage Standard](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/), all website data is unfortunately non-persistent and subject to deletion when e.g. the device is low on disk space).

Since I expect this doc will be used by a large number of users, we should optimize/polish it as much as we can. A good number to shoot for would be ~20k entries (IIRC the biggest doc we have today is Drupal 8, with 12k entries).

Is AWT still actively used? Packages like `java.rmi` and `javax.management` can probably be left out / not useful to most people. Packages like `javax.xml` and `javax.swing` could be extracted in separate doc versions (see docs like Haxe and Tensorflow), but let's first try to get the number down as much as we can.

> I have reused the logos from the request #560, but I think they might be copyrighted and I'm not sure they can be used in Devdocs. I don't see this logo on the OpenJDK and IcedTea websites. And the logo used in the Java Wikipedia article seems to be subject to fair use.

I don't think we should use the Java logo, since we're adding OpenJDK. Please remove the logo and I'll figure something out. Also, please rename the doc/scraper ""OpenJDK"".",Thibaut,freayd

593,2017-03-05 10:17:27,"As far as I understand, there is nothing else than sources provided by the OpenJDK project. So one option would be to download the sources and compile them which will generate the documentation.

Each Linux distribution provides packages, which are built by themselves from the sources. It is interesting to note that Linux distributions sometimes patch the original sources for various reasons, like adapting it to their platform or fixing bugs. Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux and the CERN all provide an OpenJDK documentation package containing a set of HTML files.

IMHO, I recommend starting from the Debian (the most reliable distribution, 23 years old now…) package. A package is a .deb file which is basically an archive. The Debian package is ""built using the [IcedTea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IcedTea) build support and patches"". My main concern still is the license, as the Debian, IcedTea and a few other building tools license is now coming up. @Thibaut can you please have a look at the [copyright file](https://gist.github.com/freayd/0d6333f9fd100cd0c416f46a1624f873) of the current Debian package and let me know if you think it is compatible with DevDocs? Thanks.",freayd,Thibaut
593,2017-03-05 14:43:12,"I've downloaded all four packages, and the documentation in each says:

> This document is the API specification for the Java™ Platform, Standard Edition.

and seems identical to http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/.

@freayd I'm not worried about the license of building tools like IcedTea. OpenJDK is licensed under GPLv2, so any derivative work has to also be licensed under GPLv2.

What I'm more worried about is whether those packages actually contain documentation built from the OpenJDK source code, and whether the GPL license applies or not. The packaging/UI of those docs indicate otherwise. Could you maybe ask for clarification on the OpenJDK mailing list?

",Thibaut,freayd
593,2017-03-07 14:00:14,"I just installed the openjdk documentation through `sudo apt install openjdk-8-doc`, which results in the same documentation as the Oracle docs in `/usr/share/doc/openjdk-8-doc/api/`. Also it shows the Oracle copyright at the bottom of the files:
> Copyright © 1993, 2017, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Use is subject to license terms. Also see the documentation redistribution policy.

The [doc redistribution policy](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/redist-137594.html) states:
> **Documentation**  The Java SE API Specification is not redistributable. One exception is granted, where permission is given to publish 10 or fewer unaltered screen shots of our documentation, whose intended purpose is to show examples of our work. Unaltered screen shots include web pages, our Java applets, our demo applets and applications, and listings of their source code.
> **API specifications** can be redistributed internally without special permission. They cannot be made available on the Internet.

So to answer your question, @Thibaut, the docs are _not_ generated from the OpenJDK source. ",japborst,Thibaut
593,2017-03-12 18:41:27,"@freayd Thanks a lot for looking into this. 

I believe you're correct and the documentation is licensed under the terms/licenses described in the [copyright file](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Eopenjdk/openjdk/openjdk8/view/head:/debian/copyright). I've looked at the source code of the OpenJDK package distributed on Debian and confirmed that the documentation is embedded in the source. This means the terms of GPLv2 license should apply to it, and any derivative work, including the API docs package, should also be licensed under GPLv2, regardless of Oracle's documentation redistribution policy (as long as the package was built from OpenJDK sources).

Additionally, if Oracle's documentation redistribution policy did apply to those packages, then Debian/Ubuntu/etc. would be violating it, as they are in fact redistributing the docs on their websites.

So I think we're good to redistribute the OpenJDK docs (downloaded from the Debian or Ubuntu repository) on DevDocs. I'll try to tackle this in the coming weeks, using [@japborst's PR](https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs/pull/560) as a starting point.

- [`coreutils`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html) (this is a big one)

- [`emacs`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

I don't know if RFC's really fits DevDocs philosophy.

Actually, I think there is no scrapper for RFCs and I think @Thibaut will not see any problem if you make your own fork of DevDocs to create a srapper for RFCs.

The ""problem"" I can see, is that there is REALLY a lot of RFCs and you'll have to find a way to sort them (As you can see, every part of the application is splitted into development langage / application).

Furthermore RFCs are not so easy / pleasant to read.

> I'd prefer we wait until 1.0 is released to keep track of multiple versions, so just change it to 0.7.0.

Okay. :+1: 

> Would you mind also including the C++ docs? (change the base URL to https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/)

I would really prefer to keep them separate so C++ users don't get results for the python api and vice versa. That's why I included the `-py` identifier for the language in the release string, so the C++ api documentation can be e.g. `0.7.0-cc` or `0.7.0-cpp`. That way users will be able to pick exactly what they need, but the different languages would still be grouped together under the general _TensorFlow_ item in the list of available apis.

I haven't included the C++ api yet because I don't use it myself, so it wouldn't get a lot of testing from my own side. But it should not be hard to try out.

IMO the new categories are a bit more useful, since it's usually pretty easy to infer whether it's a property, value, function, etc. from the name (functions have `()`, data types have `<>`, pseudo elements have `:`, etc.).

The output format is a combination of stripped down HTML files (with all the links changed) and metadata (extracted from the markup). It'd actually be more work to write a custom parser. Supporting multiple versions of ex_doc isn't a problem; only small changes to the scrapers should be required to keep things working.

@Pastafarianist could you check that there is ""lastDragValue"" in the script running DevDocs? (file like `/assets/application-[hash].js`) Maybe the cache didn't update or something.

Is your browser window aligned with the top left corner of your screen? full screen?

133,2015-02-24 13:50:02,"Hi @trollixx 

Glad to hear you're looking to make DevDocs's documentation available in Zeal.

>  Is it fine to download `index.json` and `db.json` from maxcdn-docs.devdocs.io in Zeal?

Yes, but:
- I never purge the cache on that CDN, so something like `maxcdn-docs.devdocs.io/css/index.json` is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. To get the correct version you need to append the `mtime` of that particular doc (defined in `docs.json`) as a query param (e.g. `maxcdn-docs.devdocs.io/css/index.json?1420139789`).
- I can't guarantee that I won't make breaking changes to the data format of the these files, or their location. When I do, I'll try to remember to let you know about it.
- Please attribute each document to `devdocs.io` in a way that your users will notice. It takes a lot of work to maintain these docs / metadata.

> Where is the proper place to obtain a list of all DevDocs documentation?

Currently the `docs.json` file doesn't have a unique URL (it gets deployed with a different filename every time it changes, like the other assets). I'll make `devdocs.io/docs.json` redirect to the most recent version for you this week-end. However, please make sure Zeal doesn't request that file too often (on boot is ok), since it goes through my server — not the CDN.
",Thibaut,trollixx
133,2015-02-24 18:16:51,"@Thibaut, thanks for the answer.

No any hurry at this point, such change would not happen quickly. I just wanted to confirm your acceptance of a third-party app providing access to DevDocs documentation. I still need to do a lot work to make Zeal more friendly to different formats and documentation sources.

@BenoitZugmeyer I think your interface variant would be much harder to use.

My main point in #126 is that some documentation does not fit in the original fixed with and horizontal scroll bars are very undesirable for text-based content (especially the DOM events table of contents page).

However I'm open to the idea of creating multiple documentation sets for major versions (e.g. Rails 3 & 4, Python 2 & 3). You could help with this by adding a scraper for Rails 3.

25,2014-03-19 06:27:49,"Hi @Thibaut, I've just been having a look at this now. It seems like the Rails 3 scraper is straightforward, pretty much exactly the same as the Rails 4 one. I just made a Rails3 class, updated the name, slug, and version, and checked out the tag v3.2.17 before running rdoc in the same way as you did for Rails 4 to generate the docs.

I've done this locally and have been playing around with the front-end for it. So far the necessary changes are pretty minimal, like ensuring slugs and URLs are unique or include the version number, adding a matching CSS class for each version so they all get the correct icon, ensuring you can tab-complete different versions, those kinds of things.

Is this something you're interested in pursuing further?

Keep in mind that it's also a lot more work to maintain multiple versions — after fine-tuning the scraper, I have to run a few commands, make sure everything still works, sometime update the code, and finally upload the files to S3/MaxCDN, for every update of every doc available on DevDocs.

I notice that @nfm mentioned he had made an attempt to make it work; not sure if he submitted a pull request for that.

[There's a BountySource open for this, if anyone _really_ wanted this feature they should contribute code or dollars to support its development.](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/5442208-support-multiple-versions-of-a-piece-of-software) Maybe including a link and a warning about this issue in the README or on the devdocs site might stop so many people from commenting on it and requesting it and reduce the feeling of stress/burn out.

I have added documentation to influxdb, I have some open questions/ideas:
1. I have scraped the documentation using UrlScrapper - but the documentation is open source - https://github.com/influxdata/docs.influxdata.com, I didn't know what is the preferred way for this url scrapping or file scrapping?
2. I removed the contribution guideline from everypage, which is something like this:
   `
   This documentation is open source. See a typo? Please, open an issue.
   `
   I think it will be nice to add to the attribution, what do you think?
3. It will be really easy to make this scrapper generic and support all InfluxData docs (for example Kapacitor, which I am interested in) - do you want me to do this?
4. The styling for h2 headers and etc, aren't applied, after I header ""_influx"" to _base.scss it's fixed, but I saw that the ""new documentation guideline"" and the commit log suggests that only @Thibaut only edits it..

You should be able to carry data across pages using the `context[:additional_options]` object (it's a hash so you can store anything on it, and it persists across pages, unlike the `context` object itself).

> Note that loading any page other than [devdocs.io](http://devdocs.io) directly won't work (due to limitations in AppCache).

You could have the following in your appcache manifest:



Then, when the user tries to navigate to a URI such as http://devdocs.io/css/@charset by typing directly into the URI bar or the browser being launched by an external program, the fallback would be used and devdocs could have code in the normal index page to load the correct data. I assume that devdocs.org is just sending the user the normal page anyway.

The possible gotchas here should just be that if devdocs is trying to load data through AJAX the AJAX request might get the fallback page rather than the requested data—if the user is offline and the AJAX request should have failed anyway.

Supporting launching directly to a particular documentation page when in offline mode would make the offline experience even more seemless than it already is.

Another though, if AJAX-fetched resources are only at certain namespaces anyway, would be to do the following:



If I’m understanding how appcache works correctly, this would make most users launching to a particular URI fetch it directly from appcache rather than trying to load it directly from the website first. When the browser is not able to access the Internet, this would eliminate a timeout in trying to fetch the documentation URI from the browser. When the browser is able to access the internet, this will prevent the browser from making a (small) number of superfluous requests to the server.

Thoughts?

276,2015-10-11 22:12:37,"Thanks for investigating this.

I can't enable app cache beyond the root page because (1) each page would end up in the cache, leading to an ever increasing cache (app cache constraint), and (2) the app runs in different modes when loading from the root vs. another page (so that external links to docs that the user hasn't yet enabled still work).

You can, however, load and search any page when offline like this:
http://devdocs.io/#/css/@charset

As long as the document you use for the fallback entry doesn’t have a `manifest` attribute, and it doesn’t now, then the cache shouldn’t arbitrarily increase in size.

> (2) the app runs in different modes when loading from the root vs. another page (so that external links to docs that the user hasn't yet enabled still work).

If you look at the [appcache fetch algorithm](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#changesToNetworkingModel), you’ll see that putting a URI namespace in the fallback section attempts to access the internet before loading the fallback entry. If `/` is listed as a namespace which should get the fallback document when the internet is inaccessible, that should not prevent attempts to load resources from online-only docsets. It just provides a way to serve to the user your special directly-linked mode page without the user having to be connected to the internet.

> You can, however, load and search any page when offline like this:
> http://devdocs.io/#/css/@charset
> http://devdocs.io/#q=test

Then why redirect the user to non-hash URIs? If the user browsed the whole site through hash URIs in the first place, this whole issue would be skirted ;-). The user should not need to manually edit bookmark URIs, for example, or have to edit the URIs of about restored tabs.

My point is that appcache has the capability to enable direct navigation while the user is offline even with your current URI scheme. Why not take advantage of it?

> Then why redirect the user to non-hash URIs?

Because http://devdocs.io/css/@charset is guaranteed to show you the doc even if you haven't enabled it (e.g. you clicked a link on StackOverflow). This works by comparing the request path with the ""docs"" cookie on the server, and returning a different page (single doc vs. full app) depending on if the doc is enabled or not.

http://devdocs.io/#/css/@charset, on the other hand, will fail if the doc is disabled, since the `#hash` part of the URL isn't sent to the server, and the root path will only load docs that you've enabled (for performance reasons — DevDocs has 100k entries, the app would be much slower if it loaded all of them all the time).

Thanks, that appears to work!

Ah, so right now it will not try to dynamically load the CSS docset when it sees `css` in the hash.

- Opened DevDocs on the first screen, resize sidebar.

260,2015-09-13 19:55:39,"@martine Thanks for offering to help. The fix is basically just to re-run the scraper, since it looks like MDN has started creating these pages since the last time I ran it:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/history/pushState
(but not https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/history/replaceState)
It takes a bit of time to scrape MDN and update the files. I'll do it in the next week or two.

To be honest I only have a slight understanding of what it going on here, so feel free to tell me about the code.

BTW - I love this awesome project!

Because then I have to implement drag & drop, user settings, etc. This would add a huge amount of complexity to the app and take time which I'd rather spend on other features.

Do you really find the content readable with such a large width?

I'll probably revert the fixed width this week-end but am a bit surprised you guys are that annoyed by it.

23,2013-12-11 14:41:25,"@Thibaut, I had to make the AngularJS docs work as static pages for Dash and I'd be ok if you'd want to use them for devdocs. I do ask that in return you would provide a link to Dash at the footer of each AngularJS page.

You can download the AngularJS docs Dash uses from http://kapeli.com/feeds/AngularJS.tar.bz2. Hopefully they'll be of some use to you.

23,2013-12-12 16:30:46,"@santagada I wish it was as simple as ""grabbing the data from the angular repo"". Currently the code can only generate docs by scraping them, and Angular makes that difficult by not providing static HTML files.

@Kapeli Thanks for the offer. I would rather the solution be open source and allow DevDocs to scrape the original content.

@natchiketa Sorry to bother you. Any chance you could update your script to work with Angular 1.2?
