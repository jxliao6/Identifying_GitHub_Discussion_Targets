602,2017-03-26 22:05:11,"Thanks for an outstanding PR @freayd (and @japborst for the original PR).

> I've tried to include all packages and it's working fine for me, I don't experience any slow down. They are 217 types and 46 084 entries in 4 733 files occupying 153 MB.

I'm not too worried about the speed of the search. Even with 100k entries it seems to be holding up pretty well (I did a lot of optimization a while back).

However, I'm worried about search results becoming noisy / less useful due to the 46k entries, and increasing the chance that users will hit the IndexedDB quota and lose their offline data (until browsers implement the [Storage Standard](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/), all website data is unfortunately non-persistent and subject to deletion when e.g. the device is low on disk space).

Since I expect this doc will be used by a large number of users, we should optimize/polish it as much as we can. A good number to shoot for would be ~20k entries (IIRC the biggest doc we have today is Drupal 8, with 12k entries).

Is AWT still actively used? Packages like `java.rmi` and `javax.management` can probably be left out / not useful to most people. Packages like `javax.xml` and `javax.swing` could be extracted in separate doc versions (see docs like Haxe and Tensorflow), but let's first try to get the number down as much as we can.

> I have reused the logos from the request #560, but I think they might be copyrighted and I'm not sure they can be used in Devdocs. I don't see this logo on the OpenJDK and IcedTea websites. And the logo used in the Java Wikipedia article seems to be subject to fair use.

I don't think we should use the Java logo, since we're adding OpenJDK. Please remove the logo and I'll figure something out. Also, please rename the doc/scraper ""OpenJDK"".",Thibaut,japborst
602,2017-03-27 08:34:51,"@Thibaut maybe should we split java packages into differents documentation, so Java AWT could be apart from ""Java Core"" (and some additionnal splits that we should think all together).

What do you think about it ?

593,2017-03-04 18:01:59,"Great to see people working on this! @Thibaut I have looked into OpenJDK, but the fact that there was no publicly accessible version of the docs online and some time constraints, meant I did not write a scraper for OpenJDK.

I also found this one btw: http://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/openjdk-8-doc

@freayd feel free to fork / use my branch in any way. Personally I have no experience with OpenJDK, so I have no idea how much similarities with the Oracle docs are.",japborst,Thibaut
593,2017-03-05 10:17:27,"As far as I understand, there is nothing else than sources provided by the OpenJDK project. So one option would be to download the sources and compile them which will generate the documentation.

Each Linux distribution provides packages, which are built by themselves from the sources. It is interesting to note that Linux distributions sometimes patch the original sources for various reasons, like adapting it to their platform or fixing bugs. Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux and the CERN all provide an OpenJDK documentation package containing a set of HTML files.

IMHO, I recommend starting from the Debian (the most reliable distribution, 23 years old now…) package. A package is a .deb file which is basically an archive. The Debian package is ""built using the [IcedTea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IcedTea) build support and patches"". My main concern still is the license, as the Debian, IcedTea and a few other building tools license is now coming up. @Thibaut can you please have a look at the [copyright file](https://gist.github.com/freayd/0d6333f9fd100cd0c416f46a1624f873) of the current Debian package and let me know if you think it is compatible with DevDocs? Thanks.",freayd,Thibaut
593,2017-03-07 14:00:14,"I just installed the openjdk documentation through `sudo apt install openjdk-8-doc`, which results in the same documentation as the Oracle docs in `/usr/share/doc/openjdk-8-doc/api/`. Also it shows the Oracle copyright at the bottom of the files:
> Copyright © 1993, 2017, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. Use is subject to license terms. Also see the documentation redistribution policy.

The [doc redistribution policy](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/redist-137594.html) states:
> **Documentation**  The Java SE API Specification is not redistributable. One exception is granted, where permission is given to publish 10 or fewer unaltered screen shots of our documentation, whose intended purpose is to show examples of our work. Unaltered screen shots include web pages, our Java applets, our demo applets and applications, and listings of their source code.
> **API specifications** can be redistributed internally without special permission. They cannot be made available on the Internet.

So to answer your question, @Thibaut, the docs are _not_ generated from the OpenJDK source. ",japborst,Thibaut
593,2017-03-12 18:41:27,"@freayd Thanks a lot for looking into this. 

I believe you're correct and the documentation is licensed under the terms/licenses described in the [copyright file](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Eopenjdk/openjdk/openjdk8/view/head:/debian/copyright). I've looked at the source code of the OpenJDK package distributed on Debian and confirmed that the documentation is embedded in the source. This means the terms of GPLv2 license should apply to it, and any derivative work, including the API docs package, should also be licensed under GPLv2, regardless of Oracle's documentation redistribution policy (as long as the package was built from OpenJDK sources).

Additionally, if Oracle's documentation redistribution policy did apply to those packages, then Debian/Ubuntu/etc. would be violating it, as they are in fact redistributing the docs on their websites.

So I think we're good to redistribute the OpenJDK docs (downloaded from the Debian or Ubuntu repository) on DevDocs. I'll try to tackle this in the coming weeks, using [@japborst's PR](https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs/pull/560) as a starting point.

Maybe stick with [whatever GNU provides](https://www.gnu.org/software/software.html); I get the feeling that requests for ""command line docs"" are really requests for ""GNU software"" (since a large part of the Unix ecosystem is shaped by them).  I think these packages alone could satisfy a lot of people:
- [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [`coreutils`](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html) (this is a big one)
- [`gettext`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)
- [`gnupg`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnupg/)
- [`autoconf`](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html) (and the rest of the `autotools` suite)

- [`binutils`](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/)
- [`bison`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
- [`findutils`](https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/)
- [`emacs`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- [`diffutils`](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/)
- [`gawk`](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/), the most popular flavor of `awk`
- [`grep`](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/)

> I'd prefer we wait until 1.0 is released to keep track of multiple versions, so just change it to 0.7.0.

Okay. :+1: 

> Would you mind also including the C++ docs? (change the base URL to https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/)

I would really prefer to keep them separate so C++ users don't get results for the python api and vice versa. That's why I included the `-py` identifier for the language in the release string, so the C++ api documentation can be e.g. `0.7.0-cc` or `0.7.0-cpp`. That way users will be able to pick exactly what they need, but the different languages would still be grouped together under the general _TensorFlow_ item in the list of available apis.

I haven't included the C++ api yet because I don't use it myself, so it wouldn't get a lot of testing from my own side. But it should not be hard to try out.

What do you think about doing something like the this?:

As long as I'd been using the app (which I love, by the way, don't get me wrong), it had always just expanded to the width of my browser. That set my expectation for how the app should be displayed. Then, seeing the fixed width recently, my first reaction was that it was a new issue.

I'm happy to concede that it might be more readable with the narrower width. Perhaps something like what @BenoitZugmeyer showed is a nice middle ground?

25,2014-03-19 06:27:49,"Hi @Thibaut, I've just been having a look at this now. It seems like the Rails 3 scraper is straightforward, pretty much exactly the same as the Rails 4 one. I just made a Rails3 class, updated the name, slug, and version, and checked out the tag v3.2.17 before running rdoc in the same way as you did for Rails 4 to generate the docs.

I've done this locally and have been playing around with the front-end for it. So far the necessary changes are pretty minimal, like ensuring slugs and URLs are unique or include the version number, adding a matching CSS class for each version so they all get the correct icon, ensuring you can tab-complete different versions, those kinds of things.

Is this something you're interested in pursuing further?

The highlighting issue is solved. Unfortunately Prism remove all `<a>` links inside `<pre>` tags but I haven't looked much into it. I don't think it's a big problem thought.

I don't know if RFC's really fits DevDocs philosophy.

Actually, I think there is no scrapper for RFCs and I think @Thibaut will not see any problem if you make your own fork of DevDocs to create a srapper for RFCs.

The ""problem"" I can see, is that there is REALLY a lot of RFCs and you'll have to find a way to sort them (As you can see, every part of the application is splitted into development langage / application).

Furthermore RFCs are not so easy / pleasant to read. 

But I like the idea and I wish you good luck if you want to try :)

348,2016-02-01 21:11:31,"Hi,

I have added documentation to influxdb, I have some open questions/ideas:
1. I have scraped the documentation using UrlScrapper - but the documentation is open source - https://github.com/influxdata/docs.influxdata.com, I didn't know what is the preferred way for this url scrapping or file scrapping?
2. I removed the contribution guideline from everypage, which is something like this:
   `
   This documentation is open source. See a typo? Please, open an issue.
   `
   I think it will be nice to add to the attribution, what do you think?
3. It will be really easy to make this scrapper generic and support all InfluxData docs (for example Kapacitor, which I am interested in) - do you want me to do this?
4. The styling for h2 headers and etc, aren't applied, after I header ""_influx"" to _base.scss it's fixed, but I saw that the ""new documentation guideline"" and the commit log suggests that only @Thibaut only edits it..

That's it :)

BTW - I REALLY LOVE DEVDOCS, IT MAKES MY LIFE EASIER :+1:

To be honest I only have a slight understanding of what it going on here, so feel free to tell me about the code.

BTW - I love this awesome project!

This is my first attempt at this. To be honest I only have a slight understanding of what it going on here. Also the styles may need to be changed. @Thibaut Feel free to pick this apart.

23,2013-12-11 14:41:25,"@Thibaut, I had to make the AngularJS docs work as static pages for Dash and I'd be ok if you'd want to use them for devdocs. I do ask that in return you would provide a link to Dash at the footer of each AngularJS page.

You can download the AngularJS docs Dash uses from http://kapeli.com/feeds/AngularJS.tar.bz2. Hopefully they'll be of some use to you.
