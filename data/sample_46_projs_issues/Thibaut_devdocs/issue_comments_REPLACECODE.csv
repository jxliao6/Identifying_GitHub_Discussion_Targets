602,2017-03-25 17:56:08,"As discussed in the issue #593, here comes the pull request regarding the OpenJDK documentation. This work is base on the previous #560, thanks @japborst.

The documentation is sourced from [openjdk-8-doc_8u121-b13-4_all.deb](https://packages.debian.org/sid/openjdk-8-doc). Only the subdirectoy `usr/share/doc/openjdk-8-jre-headless/api` was extracted.

I've tried to include all packages and it's working fine for me, I don't experience any slow down. They are 217 types and 46 084 entries in 4 733 files occupying 153 MB. I think many other packages than the ones proposed in #560 are useful, like `javax.xml`. What do you think @Thibaut?

The highlighting issue is solved. Unfortunately Prism remove all `<a>` links inside `<pre>` tags but I haven't looked much into it. I don't think it's a big problem thought.

The Java documentation contains a lot of duplicated information, typically a summary of all methods and further down detail explanations for these methods. I tried to remove all these duplicates so the resulting documentation is lighter and easier to read.

I have reused the logos from the request #560, but I think they might be copyrighted and I'm not sure they can be used in Devdocs. I don't see this logo on the [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) and [IcedTea](http://icedtea.classpath.org/wiki/Main_Page) websites. And the logo used in the [Java Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) seems to be subject to fair use.",freayd,

I'm not too worried about the speed of the search. Even with 100k entries it seems to be holding up pretty well (I did a lot of optimization a while back).

However, I'm worried about search results becoming noisy / less useful due to the 46k entries, and increasing the chance that users will hit the IndexedDB quota and lose their offline data (until browsers implement the [Storage Standard](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/), all website data is unfortunately non-persistent and subject to deletion when e.g. the device is low on disk space).

Since I expect this doc will be used by a large number of users, we should optimize/polish it as much as we can. A good number to shoot for would be ~20k entries (IIRC the biggest doc we have today is Drupal 8, with 12k entries).

Is AWT still actively used? Packages like `java.rmi` and `javax.management` can probably be left out / not useful to most people. Packages like `javax.xml` and `javax.swing` could be extracted in separate doc versions (see docs like Haxe and Tensorflow), but let's first try to get the number down as much as we can.

600,2017-03-26 23:25:46,"> Is there any reason the dashes should be replaced by dots?

There is. The search uses a bunch of heuristics to efficiently rank results. Among other things, the [ranking algo](https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs/blob/44ade1865ee9292e18e41662a782328c3cbbb3e6/assets/javascripts/app/searcher.coffee#L34-L74) looks at the presence/position of ""separators"" (`.`, `#`, etc.) in the matching string relative to the search query, to give higher scores to results like `document.head`, over `Headers`, when searching for `head` — thereby greatly improving the search results. For performance reasons, all ""separators"" are replaced by dots in the search strings/queries, so that all ""separators"" are just one and the same character (this makes the search orders of magnitude faster).

Dashes are considered ""separators"" so that results like `linear-gradient()` rank higher than `CanvasGradient` when searching for `gradient`. However, dashes are only considered ""separators"" when they're followed by a word character, so that searching for `-` doesn't match everything. As you can see, in-browser search is hard/tricky science 😛

593,2017-03-05 10:17:27,"As far as I understand, there is nothing else than sources provided by the OpenJDK project. So one option would be to download the sources and compile them which will generate the documentation.

Each Linux distribution provides packages, which are built by themselves from the sources. It is interesting to note that Linux distributions sometimes patch the original sources for various reasons, like adapting it to their platform or fixing bugs. Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux and the CERN all provide an OpenJDK documentation package containing a set of HTML files.

IMHO, I recommend starting from the Debian (the most reliable distribution, 23 years old now…) package. A package is a .deb file which is basically an archive. The Debian package is ""built using the [IcedTea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IcedTea) build support and patches"".

@freayd I'm not worried about the license of building tools like IcedTea. OpenJDK is licensed under GPLv2, so any derivative work has to also be licensed under GPLv2.

What I'm more worried about is whether those packages actually contain documentation built from the OpenJDK source code, and whether the GPL license applies or not. The packaging/UI of those docs indicate otherwise. Could you maybe ask for clarification on the OpenJDK mailing list?

",Thibaut,
593,2017-03-05 22:55:00,"I just spent a bit of time learning about the subject. I can't explain things better than these links (but I'll try to my best to summarize what I understood from them):
- [Wikipedia - Java Licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)#Licensing)
- [Wikipedia - OpenJDK / IcedTea inclusion in software distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK#IcedTea_and_inclusion_in_software_distributions)
- [OpenJDK - FAQ](http://openjdk.java.net/faq/)
- [Ubuntu - Java](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java)
- [Debian - Java](https://wiki.debian.org/Java)

There are several Java implementations, such as OpenJDK, Oracle Java but also many others. All are supposed to be compatible, some fully, others not. But each version has indeed its own license and some share common code.

OpenJDK is a set of the opened classes under GPL. It is actually actively developed by Oracle but also many other contributors. The Oracle Java is built on top of the OpenJDK. Oracle provides some closed source additional classes/features to their Java SE and even more to their Java EE. The IcedTea project aims to implement an alternative GPL code to every bit of Oracle Java SE closed source features. Most of the Oracle Java SE is actually open (from OpenJDK), only bits of it are closed source which explains the great similarity between the Oracle Java SE documentations and the OpenJDK / IcedTea one.

Major Linux distributions ship so called OpenJDK packages which are actually built from IcedTea sources (based on OpenJDK). Debian & Ubuntu also provide packages for the older GCJ (GNU Compiler for Java), a no longer maintained alternative. There is also an IBM Java which isn't included in Debian nor Ubuntu, but IBM provides package for these distributions. As for the Oracle JDK SE, since 2011 Debian and Ubuntu no longer have the permission to distribute it, so instead Oracle provide binaries from its website.",freayd,

The Debian OpenJDK package seems to be built form OpenJDK + IcedTea Sound + Java Access Bridge + the package code (maintened by Matthias Klose). Once more, all its licensing information is contained under its [copyright file](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~openjdk/openjdk/openjdk8/view/head:/debian/copyright). I think if one thing needs to be double checked and reviewed, it is this file.

593,2017-03-12 18:41:27,"@freayd Thanks a lot for looking into this. 

I believe you're correct and the documentation is licensed under the terms/licenses described in the [copyright file](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/%7Eopenjdk/openjdk/openjdk8/view/head:/debian/copyright). I've looked at the source code of the OpenJDK package distributed on Debian and confirmed that the documentation is embedded in the source. This means the terms of GPLv2 license should apply to it, and any derivative work, including the API docs package, should also be licensed under GPLv2, regardless of Oracle's documentation redistribution policy (as long as the package was built from OpenJDK sources).

Additionally, if Oracle's documentation redistribution policy did apply to those packages, then Debian/Ubuntu/etc. would be violating it, as they are in fact redistributing the docs on their websites.

So I think we're good to redistribute the OpenJDK docs (downloaded from the Debian or Ubuntu repository) on DevDocs. I'll try to tackle this in the coming weeks, using [@japborst's PR](https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs/pull/560) as a starting point.

587,2017-02-24 10:42:54,"Hi,
I'm using Ubuntu 16 with google chrome. I used devdocs on my unity desktop env and everything worked perfect. Then I changed my windows manager to I3 and the offline mode stopped working.
I'm getting : 

> Offline mode is unavailable.
> DevDocs requires IndexedDB to cache documentations for offline access.
> Although your browser supports IndexedDB, DevDocs couldn't open the database.
> This could be because you're browsing in private mode or have disallowed offline storage on the domain.
> 

Because I know that IndexedDB works fine on my chrome I tried to fix the issue, but when I downloaded the sources and ran it locally on the I3 env, everything worked fine (offline mode was enabled).
So devdocs offline mode is not working for me only on production server when I use I3 tiling window manager.

Have any idea what could it be?

Devdocs is amazing for docs searching, just as Sublime Text is awesome for writing code. And, here's what I'd like to do: combine both of them, just like it's possible with atom.

Since Sublime Text now supports phantoms which allows it to [display basic html](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/api_reference.html#sublime.Phantom) in the code, it's now very tempting to do a great plugin for ST using devdocs.

The problem is that ST just renders html, know's [very few CSS properties](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/minihtml.html), so, JavaScript is pretty far from being supported. So, I thought there'd be an API like this maybe:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

that'd give us a `404`, or just the doc for this particular function.

But, it looks like it's not the case... So, would it be possible to build it? Or all the search algorithm are on the client's side?

Docs with non-alphanumeric character in the name should always have an explicit `slug` defined. E.g. `C++`, `LÖVE`, `Ruby / Minitest` (in all those cases, the generated slug in this PR would be incorrect).

An extension as a full replacement of the app wouldn't be able to keep devdocs.io url in the browser address bar, there will be the ugly chrome-extension://blablabla/something. Of course one can write an extension that injects itself in devdocs.io as a content script and creates/handles absolutely everything on the page but that's weird and won't allow accessing devdocs without a network connection to the actual site. Service workers can provide such access.

Even though a chrome extension isn't required, a companion extension could be written (by a third party developer, for example) to provide some indication/access from the browser toolbar and other parts. When and if that happens, devdocs may consider adding an API endpoint for such third party extensions by using e.g. chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal for whitelisted extensions or DOM custom events that may be sent from/to an extension's content script injected into devdocs.io page.

One example of such companion extension could be an [omnibox search provider](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/omnibox) that registers a keyword in the browser so the users can type that keyword in the address bar and the extension will show autocomplete suggestions for the text input by querying devdocs API or do something more complex like [omnibox for github](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/omnibox-for-github/jbfhklldhgbomclinhlgbmjjiimafolo) does.",tophf,

Some notes if you've got plans to contribute more docs:
- I switched the syntax highlighting code to be more generic a while ago (sorry the wiki/docs aren't great :/). See [`simple.coffee`](https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs/blob/master/assets/javascripts/views/pages/simple.coffee). Just add a `data-language` attribute (and remove all existing highlighting) to the `pre` elements in the `clean_html` filter, then no need for a dedicated coffee file. 
- For readability, all pages should begin with a top-level `<h1>` element.
- It's sometimes easier to run the `entries` filter before `clean_html`, or vice-versa (e.g. when `clean_html` modifies headings).
- `include_default_entry?` should never return `false` when the page has additional entries. I did this in the past and it causes issues, because then `/page#frag` works, but `/page` doesn't, which leads to broken links. The only remaining use-case for `include_default_entry?` is when you want to visit a page but not index/store it at all (e.g. if the page has links not found on other pages).
- `self.release` → full release number
- Indent with 2 spaces.

529,2016-11-07 11:35:10,"I think this issue is a Linux version of #51.

The current keyboard shortcuts for navigating forward and back are `Control-Left` and `Control-Right`. Unfortunately I've got into the habit of using these keybindings in Chrome (53) on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) to navigate to the start or end of a word in a text box, such as the main search field. It's a bit frustrating when I mean to focus the cursor at the start of the field but instead go back to the previous page! I'm not sure if this a GNOME convention or something that's used in general across multiple desktop environments.

[Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly#w_navigation), [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?hl=en-GB), [IE 11](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/15357/windows-internet-explorer-11-keyboard-shortcuts) and [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13805/windows-keyboard-shortcuts-in-apps) already use `Alt-Left` and `Alt-Right` for forward/back; [Opera](http://help.opera.com/Linux/9.50/en/keyboard.html) apparently uses either `Alt-` or `Control-` in combination with `Left` and `Right`. I'm not a Mac user, but (in the interest of completeness) the forward/back word shortcuts are apparently [`Option-Left` and `Option-Right`](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT201236) and Safari's back/forward page shortcuts are [`Command-[` and `Command-]`](https://www.domainit.com/tools/mac-shortcuts.mhtml).

525,2016-11-04 06:02:57,The supersmall (5kB) and superfast [lz-string](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string/) library compresses data stored by devdocs.io in localStorage to 14% of its original size as tested here with 8 docs activated: 1980kB vs 267kB.,tophf,2016-11-20 23:12:06
525,2016-11-20 23:12:06,"DevDocs uses `localStorage` simply as an extra cache for the index files, on top of AppCache, to make the app boot as quickly as possible. If `localStorage` is full, there is little impact on performance, and offline availability is still complete (because the index files are also in AppCache, which acts as a fallback for any index file that the app doesn't find in `localStorage`).

So compressing the data would yield little benefit (a couple MBs of storage on the device), but at the cost of a slower app, since no matter how fast lz-string is, it'll still take quite a bit of CPU to uncompress all this data (which happens at a critical time: when the app boots).

Compressing the offline data stored in `IndexedDB` (content of the docs) would yield more benefit, as this data can amount to 10s of MBs, but again performance would take a hit (when opening docs). In my opinion, performance is more important than storage space, as the amount of storage the app uses is pretty small in comparison to other apps, and speed is key to the UX / usability of the app.

Specifically I'm facing problems when I perform a search on the page contents:
- `/` : open the search line (similar to Vim)
- `<pattern>`: enter a pattern to search
- `<cr>`: end the input, jump to the first result

The problem is that when the <kbd>Enter</kbd> (last step above) is hit the cursor moves to search box (on the top left of the page). I've played with some Pentadactyl `:map` commands in order to change the behavior of `<cr>` when browsing http://devdocs.io/ but no luck so far.

The help at http://devdocs.io/help mentions that it is possible to select options through the URL:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

It would be nice if I could disable the keyboard shortcuts on the URL as well:

517,2016-10-30 22:35:24,"I think this is very much an edge case / not something that most people need, so I'm a bit reluctant to make it a feature. You can disable keyboard shortcuts after the app has loaded by running `app.shortcuts.stop()`, which you could automate using something like Greasemonkey. Does that address your use-case? 
",Thibaut,2017-03-04 14:54:32
517,2016-10-31 11:59:36,"This is probably an issue for every Vimperator/Pentadactyl user, but I have no idea how many people use it, so maybe it is an edge case used for too few people.

To be honest I was hopping for a simpler solution, because I don't know Greasemonkey and it seems an overkill to install another extension in order to disable a shortcut in a single site (and hope this doesn't mess with Pentadactyl).

If this kind of issue should be handled by the user them it is probably better to solve it directly on Pentadactyl, as it has several options and mappings for keys. Those options/mappings allowed to solve similar issues in several other sites; I'm having some trouble here because the shortcut involves the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key, so remapping it to <nop> disables the default shortcut but also prevents the search in Pentadactyl (because search & commands are delimited by the <kbd>Enter</kbd>).

As I've run out of ideas to make this work using mappings, I've tried to use your suggestion of calling the javascript code you mentioned. Pentadactyl [provides a function to execute javascript](http://5digits.org/help/pentadactyl/eval.xhtml#:js), and based [in an example at superuser](http://superuser.com/questions/891648/) I tested this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This stopped the shortcuts when browsing the page, but for some reason it is still triggered when finishing the search on Pentadactyl's search line. I'm wondering if the command above is entered on one frame, and the search triggers the shortcut in a different frame. Is there any javascript call that disables the shortcuts more globally/forcefully?

`app.shortcuts.stop()` forcefully disables all keyboard shortcuts, but if the app hasn't finished loading yet, then those shortcuts will be re-enabled as part of the loading process. Is there an option in Pentadactyl to run some JavaScript only once the page has finished loading?

I am thinking of a new feature which shouldn't be hard to build in a general way, the problem could mainly be to fit it in the overall experience.

Often i use Devdocs for checking quickly some assumptions or getting more info about a topic, and i am satisfied by the answers i find within the app. In a few other cases, though, i feel the need to deepen more, or to see the information in its context, or to use decorative info (style, dynamic panels) which was stripped out in the Devdocs version. Other times i want to send the link to the related doc to someone, and i know that the original page has more detailed anchors than the Devdoc version.

For all these reasons, i wish that there was a way to open the current Devdocs page, from its original source, in a new tab. I wish i had a button or a keyboard shortcut for that. In asking for this i am assuming that most docs have a web counterpart and i might be wrong about this, but the button or the shortcut might be missing or disabled when this is not the case.

Pedantic description of the use case:
- The user navigates to Devdocs
- They search for a keyword, for example `input`, and they find [the related page](http://devdocs.io/dom_events/input)
- They now click on a button, or use a keyboard shortcut, to open the original page from `developer.mozilla.org` in a new tab

Not a trivial undertaking, but far short of 100,000 `man` pages; this covers the most common command-line ground anyway.  I believe they even all use the same documentation and HTML generation tools, so you'd only really need to write one scraper.

502,2016-10-06 16:13:29,"Hello and thanks for the great work!

I've enabled the documentation for Django 1.10, and I'm typing, for example, `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in the search field. Unfortunately nothing is coming up, even though this can be found by manually locating `http://devdocs.io/django~1.10/ref/settings` after typing `settings`. 

Is this an overall limitation of the devdocs.io search functionality or a specific issue with the Django docs indexing? I'm thinking the latter, since in Python 3 I'm able to search for stuff that doesn't have their own page, like `str.split`.

Help?
",dev169,2016-11-08 12:24:28
502,2016-10-16 13:34:30,"Hi

Every entry in DevDocs's index is manually indexed (as in there is code in the scraper that goes look for it). It's not like Google where you can just search anything and it'll find anything (that wouldn't work offline in a browser). So as you said it's primarily a limitation of the DevDocs search.

However, in this case it should be possible to index the headings on that page so that each becomes an entry in the search index. The trick is to index only the headings that should appear in the search index (things like ""Introduction"", ""Overview"", etc. should not). I'll try to do that next time I update the Django docs.

Thanks for the feedback.

496,2016-09-26 09:51:25,"As indicated in e.g. #331, MathML is not supported in DevDocs in unsupported browsers such as Chrome.  This PR uses the same CSS fallback [Mozilla uses](https://developer.cdn.mozilla.net/static/styles/libs/mathml.css) in their docs, that originates from this repo [fred-wang/mathml.css](https://github.com/fred-wang/mathml.css): example [Math.PI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/PI) This method is doc-agnostic, so will also work for all other docs that uses MathML. 

Process is as follows:
1. Check for MathML support
2. Sideload CSS if not existent

This method saves bandwidth and is thus faster if MathML is supported. However, currently it sideloads the CSS externally.

2 possible alternatives:
1. Sideload the CSS locally (couldn't figure out how to do that in the set-up of DevDocs, unfortunatly)
2. Alter the css with a `.fallback` class, include in `application.css.scss` and apply class if not supported. However, the docs are not present on load so applying the class makes it difficult.

Whilst [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) provides much better support, it is rather immense...

Thank you for this awesome platform of documentations!

I'm really used to scroll pages via my arrow keys, so I expect this behavior on pretty any page. especially on documentation.

I understand that arrow keys are used for the sidebar, since you want to quickly get to your search results, whenever you type something.

**My suggestion:**
Instead of changing the default user experience for navigating through content to shift+arrowkey, I would only add eventhandlers for the results after something has been searched. Otherwise - when do you need to quickly navigate through pages other than the search results?

So maybe on Enter/Blur - we could switch back to navigate content rather than page items.

Please let me know what your thoughts are.

The arrow keys are also used to navigate the hierarchy of docs/categories/classes,functions,etc in the sidebar — not just for the search results. I think it's best to keep the behavior of the arrow keys consistent throughout the app.

There are already multiple ways to clear the search field without resetting the scope:

- by clicking the ""X"" icon (which can be focused/activated by hitting `tab`)

Either Ubuntu distributed Firefox with touch events (`ontouchstart` et. al.) enabled or _I_'m the culprit and enabled them and forgot I tampered with those settings. Disabling them in `about:config` fixes the issue for me. I guess there is currently no way of detecting whether a focused input actually triggers a soft keyboard to pop up.

458,2016-08-16 00:06:35,"I stumbled upon this issue by being unable to find documentation for `typing.NewType` [introduced in Python 3.5.2](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html#python-3-5-2). Comparing [the page for the `typing` module on DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/python%7E3.5/library/typing#type-aliases) with [its official source](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/typing.html#type-aliases), you can see that the first section should have more content, and the section following it is missing.

Looking further, I have noticed that [the official docs](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/index.html) for the latest stable Python version (with ""Python » 3.5.2 Documentation"" showing on the top) keep receiving updates even after the release on 2016-06-26. [According to their repo](https://github.com/python/cpython/commits/3.5/Doc/library?page=2), there are about 60 commits on their 3.5 branch touching the docs as shown on their website that are missing in the DevDocs snapshot. ""Issue #24136"" from Jun 12 is there (listed in the changelog under ""Python 3.5.2 release candidate 1""), but not the following commit ""Issue #27221"", or ""Issue #16182"" (listed under ""Python 3.5.3 release candidate 1"").

My guess is that the missing changes are technically meant to 'ship' with 3.5.3. But since they seem to be mostly fixes for mistakes or missing/outdated info in the docs, they are shown on the official site immediately, even the ones commited as recently as today ([[1]](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/typing.html#typing.AnyStr), [[2]](https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/2a50a4e347bdf898e629d3078d521295072e3977)).

In other words, if that's not too much effort, I propose that the Python docs should be (auto-)updated more often.

458,2016-08-20 18:50:25,"Updating docs is a manual process. I can only do it as often as my spare time allows and must balance spending time updating docs with adding new ones and improving the app. Updating docs in between releases doesn't make the cut because most of the time there are no significant changes in the documentation, and I'd rather spend my time on higher-impact things.

Fully automating the update process is not realistic at this stage given the architecture of DevDocs and my limited spare time.

This would add a second entry in the list of docs for Padrino. That list is already pretty long + I'd rather keep the data clean, with each doc encapsulated in a single package.

Rails and a few other docs have the same problem/need, so I think I'll take a stab at adding multi-origin support sometime soon.

Actually, I think there is no scrapper for RFCs and I think @Thibaut will not see any problem if you make your own fork of DevDocs to create a srapper for RFCs.

The ""problem"" I can see, is that there is REALLY a lot of RFCs and you'll have to find a way to sort them (As you can see, every part of the application is splitted into development langage / application).

Furthermore RFCs are not so easy / pleasant to read.

1. The behaviour I observed had it persisting the selection beyond the ""10 seconds after the last devdocs tab is closed"" point.

So if the cookie is required for IDB database but only set when creating / downloading the database, then deleting the cookies without (fully) clearing the database leads to a corrupted state, as you said, right?:

2. Run `thor docs:page love Canvas:renderTo` (which might fail because the `docs:page` command is broken, just remove the check at [lib/tasks/docs.thor#L34:L36](https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs/blob/master/lib/tasks/docs.thor#L34:L36) for now).

_Expected result:_ `public/docs/love/canvas:renderto.html` (or similar) is generated.

_Actual result:_ `public/docs/love/canvas` is generated.

While writing a scraper for the [LÖVE](http://love2d.org) engine documentation I ran into an issue where remote pages with colons in their slugs (for example [Canvas:renderTo](https://love2d.org/wiki/Canvas:renderTo)) are being written to files named like the slug up to the first colon (for example `public/docs/love/canvas`). This results both in subsequent pages overwriting this file and in the client not being able to find this file under the expected path.

I would fix this problem myself in a pull-request, but I am neither sure where path sanitization logic would be appropriately placed (I assume in `Docs.Doc#path`) nor what to replace unsafe characters with to keep the integrity of other documentations.

Perhaps the LaTeX formulas can be converted to images while scraping the documentation. For example I think Wikipedia generates PNGs serverside.

I found [this ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/latex2image/versions/0.1.0) to do it, but it will require a full install of TeX Live to do the conversion while scraping.

As discussed via email, before announcing/finalizing the feature we need to:
- make the sidebar show/hide automatically when searching

If I hit `tab` instead, then I can further search _specifically through_ that documentation.

Unfortunately, I have to choose one or the other; _and_ I have to hunt down that light-grey hamburger with my eyes/mouse.

I would posit that tab-selection of a documentation-set should also focus on that set in the sidebar, displaying the same TOC of documentation-contents as clicking on the hamburger does.

I made a shot at creating an entry for Haxe documentation. It went rather smoothly except for the additional entries: since the language is organized on package and class, there is a lot of entries in each top level type. 

Is there a way to not show class fields in the nav bar but show them on search? Or maybe create multiple levels on the navigation? 

Improvement ideas are very welcomed :smile: !

> Is there a way to not show class fields in the nav bar but show them on search?

Yes but I'd prefer all entries have a `type` / are accessible via the sidebar nav. If there are lots of types, we can group things together more aggressively.

For this PR I think we should group all the platform-specific entries together. I.e. a single type for ""cpp"", ""java"", etc. so we end up with the same top level types as on http://api.haxe.org/ 

> Or maybe create multiple levels on the navigation? 

This has come up a couple times but for now my position is that it would add too much complexity to the app, for a small payoff.

In spite of not having any experience with either ruby or css, I managed to add documentation for [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)'s python API.

Two notes:
1. Since TF has both a C++ and a python API, and probably will have more in the future, i set the release string to `0.6.0-py` to indicate that this is the python api. Let me know if you think something else would be better.
2. I can't figure out how to add syntax highlighting to the documentation. If I just try to make a copy of `sphinx.coffee` in `ssets/javascripts/views/pages/` and change line 3 to `class app.views.TensorflowPage extends app.views.BasePage` I can't load the DevDocs web app at all. Luckily syntax highlighting is not a deal breaker. :-)

Okay. :+1: 

> Would you mind also including the C++ docs? (change the base URL to https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/)

I would really prefer to keep them separate so C++ users don't get results for the python api and vice versa. That's why I included the `-py` identifier for the language in the release string, so the C++ api documentation can be e.g. `0.7.0-cc` or `0.7.0-cpp`. That way users will be able to pick exactly what they need, but the different languages would still be grouped together under the general _TensorFlow_ item in the list of available apis.

I haven't included the C++ api yet because I don't use it myself, so it wouldn't get a lot of testing from my own side. But it should not be hard to try out.

Why don't we scrape all [4 docs](https://docs.influxdata.com/) under one doc/scraper? Seems they all go together + it'd make things easier to maintain & to toggle on/off in the app.

Yes, except we can still break up the categories (types) of each doc, instead of grouping all entries under ""InfluxDB"", ""Kapacitor"", etc.

Either that or we only add InfluxDB. The other projects are not very popular on GitHub and I'd rather not overload the UI with 3 separate docs — all owned by the same commercial entity.

Types can't be nested more than one level. But in `get_type` you can just return strings like `InfluxDB: Foo`, `InfluxDB: Bar`, `Kapacitor: Baz`, etc. so they'll be ordered by project in the sidebar.

If so, I will fix the scrapper to handle all documentations (chrono, kapacitor, telegraf and influxdb).

- InfluxData 
  - InfluxDB

first of all thank you for this great plugin. I went through the documentation and tried to follow the guides on https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs/wiki/Adding-documentations-to-DevDocs to get the documentation of http://padrinorb.com/ (the doc of the framework is written in rdoc http://www.rubydoc.info/github/padrino/padrino-framework).

You can find my commit under https://github.com/wikimatze/devdocs/tree/padrino-support

A `docs:page padrino --debug` give me the following output

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

and a `thor docs:generate padrino --force --debug` give me the following error:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I can't figure out what's wrong. I tried the bower scrape and remove the `clean_html.rb` as well as the `clean_html.rb` and the scrape command scraped me the whole page => this is something I would expect from my example as well.

Such unwanted behavior (in this case) may be mitigated implementing an export/import feature:
- The user can export their downloaded documentations into a JSON file, to store as a backup in case the browser deletes local data. The file would include a backup of the localStorage and IndexedDB.
- At later time, the user can an import the backup JSON file via file upload, completely overwriting the localStorage and IndexedDB into the backed-up values and restoring offline documentation access.

As far as I know, the only issue the user might face is being unable to access DevDocs offline in the first place, but I'm hopeful someone could think of a solution to mitigate this issue.

IMO the new categories are a bit more useful, since it's usually pretty easy to infer whether it's a property, value, function, etc. from the name (functions have `()`, data types have `<>`, pseudo elements have `:`, etc.).

> Note: When enabled (the default), IE to learn more about them.

My guess is that the web scraper misinterpreted the meaning of the encoded open angle bracket in ""IE<11"" and what looks like a bogus tag in the source HTML. Here's what angular's HTML looks like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The ""bogus"" tag I mentioned is `<http: blogs.msdn.com="""" b="""" ie="""" archive="""" 2008="""" 10="""" 16="""" ending-expressions.aspx="""">`. It looks like a mangled link. (See the [source](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/v1.4.7/src/ng/sce.js#L417).)

Here is what the HTML from the currently deployed dev docs looks like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I bet the scraper probably should not interpret `&lt;` as the start of an HTML tag. Maybe it's an upstream bug.

Some prefixes I've setup personally have been:

When I want to for example search for a function in angular documentation I would type in the following:
`ng:isnumber` and it will only show me search result pages for the documentations that match that prefix (yes multiple documentations can share a similar prefix).

Supporting multiple versions of ex_doc isn't a problem; only small changes to the scrapers should be required to keep things working.

Dijit is dojo's widget library, this is actually heavily used but it's depends on the developer's usage. Most of the projects I'ved worked on for instance, we only used the framework to build our own widgets along with one or two of the more common widgets like the modal dialog.

I would probably ignore dojox completely. in regards to dijit, I think making a subclass of the scraper which only targets dijit would be better so that people could decide if they wanted it like Jquery vs Jquery UI. Let me know what you think I don't mind implementing it.

@Thibaut I am not sure how to achieve this. For example: http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api/catch.html doesn't specify what section it belongs to. It is visible only on the http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/api-reference.html page. Is there a feasible way I can carry forward that information from the reference page?

286,2015-12-13 16:58:28,"@awalGarg I don't see another way to achieve this. What you described sounds like the best solution.

You should be able to carry data across pages using the `context[:additional_options]` object (it's a hash so you can store anything on it, and it persists across pages, unlike the `context` object itself).

It'll be a bit of a hack but if it works I can clean up later (e.g. make it a proper `context[:env]` object).

1. Enter [a website](http://ricardo.cc/2013/06/07/react-tutorial-rewritten-in-plain-javascript.html)
2. The extension automatically identifies code snippets and the language they're written in
3. Hover mouse over a function name/module/class etc. to get a short description  
   Like (the scope of the info is to be discussed) ""_Returns the first element within the document (using depth-first pre-order traversal of the document's nodes|by first element in document markup and iterating through sequential nodes by order of amount of child nodes) that matches the specified group of selectors._"" for `document.QuerySelector`
4. Click to get to [full doc on devdocs.io](http://devdocs.io/dom/document/queryselector)

Benefits
- It complies with the cornerstone of DevDoc's vision: _DevDocs aims to make reading and searching reference documentation fast, easy and enjoyable._
- Could make it faster to understand code, especially when at the early stages of learning a given subject.
  - Would replace the current workflow: ctrl+l -> d -> tab -> [type in query string] -> enter

The Contributing Guidelines are asking that you open an issue if you're actively working on adding a new documentation, so that multiple people don't work on the same doc at the same time. If you're not working on it (as was the case in all these issues), then you should use Trello. Otherwise we'll end up with as many GitHub issues as we have Trello cards.

I'll remove the sentence that asks to open an issue when working on a doc, to avoid the confusion.

No, but the doc should be reasonably popular (i.e. don't submit your personal/just-launched projects until they've gotten some traction).

No, but better check with me first (GitHub issue or email).

276,2015-10-09 13:47:20,"The Offline docs state:

> Note that loading any page other than [devdocs.io](http://devdocs.io) directly won't work (due to limitations in AppCache).

You could have the following in your appcache manifest:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Then, when the user tries to navigate to a URI such as http://devdocs.io/css/@charset by typing directly into the URI bar or the browser being launched by an external program, the fallback would be used and devdocs could have code in the normal index page to load the correct data. I assume that devdocs.org is just sending the user the normal page anyway.

The possible gotchas here should just be that if devdocs is trying to load data through AJAX the AJAX request might get the fallback page rather than the requested data—if the user is offline and the AJAX request should have failed anyway.

Supporting launching directly to a particular documentation page when in offline mode would make the offline experience even more seemless than it already is.

Another though, if AJAX-fetched resources are only at certain namespaces anyway, would be to do the following:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

If I’m understanding how appcache works correctly, this would make most users launching to a particular URI fetch it directly from appcache rather than trying to load it directly from the website first. When the browser is not able to access the Internet, this would eliminate a timeout in trying to fetch the documentation URI from the browser. When the browser is able to access the internet, this will prevent the browser from making a (small) number of superfluous requests to the server.

Thoughts?

I can't enable app cache beyond the root page because (1) each page would end up in the cache, leading to an ever increasing cache (app cache constraint), and (2) the app runs in different modes when loading from the root vs. another page (so that external links to docs that the user hasn't yet enabled still work).

As long as the document you use for the fallback entry doesn’t have a `manifest` attribute, and it doesn’t now, then the cache shouldn’t arbitrarily increase in size.

> (2) the app runs in different modes when loading from the root vs. another page (so that external links to docs that the user hasn't yet enabled still work).

If you look at the [appcache fetch algorithm](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#changesToNetworkingModel), you’ll see that putting a URI namespace in the fallback section attempts to access the internet before loading the fallback entry. If `/` is listed as a namespace which should get the fallback document when the internet is inaccessible, that should not prevent attempts to load resources from online-only docsets. It just provides a way to serve to the user your special directly-linked mode page without the user having to be connected to the internet.

> You can, however, load and search any page when offline like this:
> http://devdocs.io/#/css/@charset
> http://devdocs.io/#q=test

Then why redirect the user to non-hash URIs? If the user browsed the whole site through hash URIs in the first place, this whole issue would be skirted ;-). The user should not need to manually edit bookmark URIs, for example, or have to edit the URIs of about restored tabs.

My point is that appcache has the capability to enable direct navigation while the user is offline even with your current URI scheme. Why not take advantage of it?

> Then why redirect the user to non-hash URIs?

Because http://devdocs.io/css/@charset is guaranteed to show you the doc even if you haven't enabled it (e.g. you clicked a link on StackOverflow). This works by comparing the request path with the ""docs"" cookie on the server, and returning a different page (single doc vs. full app) depending on if the doc is enabled or not.

http://devdocs.io/#/css/@charset, on the other hand, will fail if the doc is disabled, since the `#hash` part of the URL isn't sent to the server, and the root path will only load docs that you've enabled (for performance reasons — DevDocs has 100k entries, the app would be much slower if it loaded all of them all the time).

274,2015-10-05 21:12:58,"I was quite excited finding this repository and it even includes a JSON API as concluded here: https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs/issues/133 

Now that this project has a JSON-API; I suggest we use it to not only integrate into IDE's but possibly into a Mobile App where you can use a phone and/or tablet (which this on tablets would be awesome to use this with) would be very useful to have. I see that you have a mobile version which you can download offline docs and it is wonderfully made and designed as stated in the goals of the repository: ""...maintain a clean and readable user interface; be fully functional offline; support full keyboard navigation;"". Though I want to take these goals a step further by introducing the idea for a mobile app. I think introducing a native mobile app in will take what all the contributors have achieved in meeting the goals and take it a step further by ""...maintain[ing] a clean and readable user interface..."" by adhering to the design standards of the apps ecosystem, ""...be fully functional offline..."" by ushering the app into a native ecosystem to their respective platform, ""support full keyboard navigation"" by coming up with ways to make a efficient UX by not just a keyboard but a touch interface.

Of coarse I would love for one defined user interface though there are standards to those interfaces which the users of mobile devices are accustomed to. Developers of cross platform apps sometimes tend to try to create a different UX and UI experience based on the platform they are developing for. The reason for this is because even though there is a lot more effort(and money) into redesigning an app for each platform. Even though the statement is vague that the project's goals are to ""...maintain a clean and readable user interface..."" and ""...support full keyboard support..."" I would think of asking myself what defines a clean user interface?. Also, why is it not stated to provide ""...support for fully touch interfaces...""? It means different things to different people of a clean interface because one could say Google's ""Material Design Standards"" are clean when in an iPhone in the users eyes would maybe say ""iPhone's Design Standards"" for apps provide a cleaner user interface. One could argue that we don't want to create a complexity through making an interface for each platform and we must keep consistency for the sake for the project. Though in another light, we are only making small tweaks. As far as I know both Android and IOS have the commonly used ""sliding sidebar"" and their are quite a good amount of similarities in terms of design and user interface that can be implemented in both apps. But it would probably be a good idea to implement them in the ecosystem that the users are used to in which gives a highly available experience. Please discuss this and even argue on my points, I would like to see another perspective other than mine. 

Speaking of a highly available experience, another goal of the project is to ""...be fully functional offline..."". And their is no better way to do that than ushering a native experience for the project. The project indeed has downloadable offline docs and caching. Though bringing a native experience is far more accessible than caching. Caching requires the user to access the website and yes so does downloading the app needs the internet to download from the apps native app store. Though I want to leave that open for discussion since both benefits seem to equal each other.

So I believe their is potential for devdocs.io to move into the mobile app sphere. Even though I think its important rather to support more languages, frameworks, and libraries into the project; it still is an extra thing we can keep in mind as we continue to move forward with it. I have worked with Android Development myself and feel this would be something I would want on my Samsung Note 10.1 2014 edition tablet to use for quick reference with one less browser window open on my desktop. I would also like to hear what others think they can use this for. Please feel free to correct me on anything I said regarding any technical and grammatical related matters(I'm not perfect and we all make mistakes).

DevDocs doesn't have an API yet. It only makes certain files (used by the web app for the search) publicly available. You're free to use those to make your own app.

I have no interest in making a native app, sorry. I don't have the time (DevDocs is just a side project of mine), nor feel that this is in the spirit of the project (even though I can see the use case). The web app has a mobile-optimized version; you can add a shortcut to it on your homescreen and get most of the functionality that a native app would provide (PRs that improve the UI are welcome).

I have no objections to anyone making a native version of DevDocs, though, so long as you credit DevDocs for the data and use a different name (see the [copyright section of the README](https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs#copyright--license)).

one major goal is to provide a way of finding things fast but currently the search seems to be limited to the title of a doc. For example, when I select AngularJS's docs and search for _promise_ I expect to find the docs relating to $q but nothing related shows up even though the actual page describing $q mentions the word _promise_ 108 times.

As you said this isn't trivial. The search is done completely client-side, which is why DevDocs is fast, free (no expensive servers needed), and works offline.

The README also says that ""the project doesn't intend to compete with full-text search engines"". This is still my position today. I can only work on DevDocs on my spare time, which is not enough to implement such major changes, sorry.

I _can_ shrink the sidebar to the minimum width of 260px (according to the ""Computed"" tab under ""Elements"" in Chrome's developer console). When I start enlarging it by dragging it left-to-right, the sidebar follows the cursor smoothly. However, as soon as I release the mouse, it instantly jumps to a larger width, which is variable and depends on the width to which I enlarged it by dragging. Examples:
- 270 → 337
- 280 → 350
- 300 → 375

Both read the cursor position from `event.pageX` but somehow `onDragEnd` ends up writing a different value, when it should always be the same as the last `onDrag` value (which is what I get on all the browsers I've tested). I even added a check that the `dragend` value is within 5px of the last `drag` value a [couple weeks ago](https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs/commit/c2a20ef5863081aca00003bde4d50deca1a139a8).

@Pastafarianist could you check that there is ""lastDragValue"" in the script running DevDocs? (file like `/assets/application-[hash].js`) Maybe the cache didn't update or something.

The Chrome window is typically maximized. I enabled full screen to take the screenshot.

I've also just checked that the bug is reproducible in incognito with all extensions disabled and with a non-maximized window.

Three example attributes, `align`, `axis` and `bgcolor` are listed below, with MDN icons replaced by connotations in brackets:

| Attribute | Attribute and Connotation in MDN | Rendered content in devdocs |

| `axis` | `axis` (obsolete) in HTML5 | `axis` in HTML5 |
| `bgcolor` | `bgcolor`(non-standard) | `bgcolor` |

While there are additional notes beneath the description for the attributes regarding the usage of the relevant attribute, it would be useful to have this information displayed next to the attribute name itself.

DevDocs doesn't have an API. The search is done entirely in the browser. That's why it's fast no matter how slow your internet connection is :)

The web app gets metadata to use for the search (name/path of functions, etc.), then loads the pages from the CDN (or IndexedDB, if you've downloaded the doc for offline access).

226,2015-06-27 14:07:01,"I'm wondering if it's just me, but I saw this in Chrome the other day, but not in FF, now in both. When I want to filter on a specific doc set, say lodash, I'll type it's name and then hit tab or command-enter to bring it into a new window. The rest of the docs melt away and stay out of my way until I hit escape twice. I noticed this stopped working in Chrome first, now FF. Now it actually takes me to the head of that doc set, but searching still does a global search across all docs I'm subscribed to, making the ""filtering"" pretty useless. When I saw this the first time I tried clearing cache, trying an Incognito window in Chrome, all to no avail...

What is interesting is that if I filter on a doc set name that I don't have enabled, it'll filter exactly how I'd expect it to. But anything in my enabled doc list doesn't filter the same...

Slight update - the tab functionality appears to work although visually it still shows the rest of the docs after you hit tab but before you start actually typing in order to search. The command-enter functionality, however, looks the same as the tab, but searching isn't limited to the doc set that you ""enter-tabbed"" into... weird.

Sorry for the late reply.

This was a side-effect of fixing #209. When pinning the tab and restarting the browser, DevDocs used to launch in ""single doc"" mode unless the last URL was the root URL. Me and others found it annoying to have to press `Esc` twice to go back to ""all docs"" mode, so I made it so the app always boots in that mode for docs that have been enabled.

Tomorrow I will make it so the search scope is automatically set when the app is launched from a doc URL, which should resolve this issue (command+enter will then focus a doc until you press `Esc`).

In one of the recent releases, I started noticing that when I use DevDocs for the first time each day (which is: after a reboot, after launching Chrome for the first time, with DevDocs loaded in the ""rooted"" mode), when I press ESC a few times and get to the point where it would have gone to the site root, the site instead freezes. I left it alone for a while today, and eventually this happened:

205,2015-05-18 20:14:05,"Thanks again for your contribution & hard work. This is adding a lot of complexity for one set of docs, which makes it harder / more time-consuming for me to maintain things in the future. I'd like to explore ways we can get simplify this before moving forward (unfortunately Drupal has the worst URLs of any docs I've ever seen, by a long margin :/).

Questions & comments:
1. Why did you need the `p.gsub! /\./, '_'` and `p.gsub /__/, '..'` in `fixUri`? (can you provide examples/stacktraces where it failed?)
2. If we add an option to run each URL/path through `URI.decode_www_form` for a given scraper, we should be able to get rid of `fixUri` and the monkey patches in `NormalizePathsFilter`, `InternalUrlsFilter` and `EntriesFilter`. I'll look into that when I have time.
3. Each entry should have a type (never `nil`, unless the doc has no types at all), otherwise they don't appear in the sidebar. Guides &co can be grouped together or skipped (API stuff is more important).
4. Skip all the changelog stuff (""Updates from 6.x to 7.x""). The doc is clocking at 50MB, we should try to trim down the fat as much as possible (more entries == less useful search, bigger size == more likely offline storage will exceed the browser's quota).
5. I'd prefer we remove all the `/7`, e.g., instead of scrapping https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!form.inc/function/batch_get/7 we should scrape https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!form.inc/function/batch_get. We could do that using `fix_urls` similarly to [here](https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs/blob/744d7caa8a504998a14868bf1bb6db416e632ce3/lib/docs/scrapers/laravel.rb#L35).

3. I removed a lot of these skipping updates, test, etc. For the remaining, even if they won't appear in the sidebar still are searchable. Lot of these functions are hook implementations of the core modules.
4. Done. Added several skips
5. Done. Whenever drupal v8 is released (and default in docs) we will need to get it back.

Scraping the same path twice with different query params isn't supported, sorry. The location of the file and a bunch of other things are entirely based on the path, and it would be quite difficult to change that.

What you could do instead is manually add the URLs on page 2 to your scraper's `initial_paths`, like [here](https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs/blob/0a09c8904e88692b13f877f8b797bf6f9a9105c2/lib/docs/scrapers/requirejs.rb#L8-L16). It's a bit harder to maintain (you have to manually hard-code the paths), but will achieve the same effect as visiting the page with the scraper.

Hope this helps. Closing this issue as it's not really an issue.

I'd love to have this option on DevDocs. If it's something you think makes sense for DevDocs, I could try to add it myself. :)

178,2015-03-12 18:18:48,"#### Introduction

I've been trying to nail down the steps for this for a few days now and I finally got it!
#### Steps
1. Enable **Node.js** and at least one other language.
2. In the search box...
   1. Type `node<TAB>` to enable the filter.
   2. Type `unlink<ENTER>` to select the **fs.unlink** article.
      
      > _This will open the unlink article, and rewrite the URL to `/node/fs#fs_fs_unlink_path_callback`._
3. Reload the page.
   
   > _For me, this happens when my previous tabs are re-opened the next day from their previous-day state._
#### Results

What happens is that the site loads in the `/node` folder and from that point on is ""rooted"" to the **Node.js** documentation. There's no clear way to get back to other languages outside of clicking the **DevDocs** link or manually going to the site root.

To me, if the site is rewriting the URL to add the new documentation path, reloading should return it to the state it was in when it got rewritten rather than the ""rooted"" state that it loads in now. That is, the search box should contain the filter and the full tree should be displayed with the appropriate documentation article selected.
#### Aside

DevDocs is a fantastic idea that has been very well executed. It is a permanently-open tab for me, at work. This issue is absolutely a minor inconvenience, but I wanted to report it as I didn't see it in the list of open issues. Thanks for creating this awesome tool!
",nazrhyn,2015-03-14 23:16:47
178,2015-03-14 23:16:47,"Thanks for the detailed issue.

This is the intended behavior (there is a banner at the bottom of the page that tells you when the app is in ""single doc"" mode). It's required because of how DevDocs work (to keep things fast, only the docs the user has selected are loaded in memory), as well as limitations in the AppCache API (which is only reliable on the root path).

To go from ""single doc"" mode to ""full app"" mode you can also press `escape` twice.

Seems to be more pronounced in Chrome than FireFox, it appears you have decent contrast for block-code areas, so I guess this is just a consistency issue. In the example below the `font-family` attribute for the `code` element is unchecked.

It makes reading the text somewhat of a chore and turns me off of the otherwise great-looking new dark theme and to me, **that makes it a bug.**

And since I thought it was a problem, **I took a shot at finding a solution.**, I did a little testing and came up with this **_tiny**_ adjustment below (pull request incoming).  Original HEX values temporarily **converted to HSL to isolate the issue source** using devtools and show differences easily.  

**Example:**

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
## Old

> color: hsl(48, 3%, 70%);
>     = #B4B3AF
## Goldilocks-approved

> color: hsl(48, 3%, **90%**);
>     = **#E6E6E5**

The other colors (syntax highlighting) also need adjusting in the same manner.  I'll try to pull req those too.

_But don't take my word for it._  
**Try it yourself** in devtools and see if you agree.  _Maybe it's just me._

My setup:  
- Chrome 40 x64
- ASUS LED monitor
  - tested with all default monitor modes, **sRGB** being lower end of the scale, **Scenery** at the top.

PS - love the new theme though.  It almost matches just about **everything else I use** :+1: :)

a workaround

browse to the directory where you have the application
delete this file /devdocs-master/Gemfile.lock 
now run on your terminal ruby-v  the output will be something like this depending
on the version:

ruby 2.1.5p273 (2014-11-13 revision 48405) [x86_64-linux]

must now edit the Gemfile and add your version of ruby

I wonder if it is safe to edit the Gemfile to modify the specific ruby version? No idea how devdocs is working, just ask.

I think both your solution and mine are quite brutal. Maybe there's a way to edit some file just related to bundler, cuz it's just bundler who cause the problem.

Glad to hear you're looking to make DevDocs's documentation available in Zeal.

>  Is it fine to download `index.json` and `db.json` from maxcdn-docs.devdocs.io in Zeal?

Yes, but:
- I never purge the cache on that CDN, so something like `maxcdn-docs.devdocs.io/css/index.json` is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. To get the correct version you need to append the `mtime` of that particular doc (defined in `docs.json`) as a query param (e.g. `maxcdn-docs.devdocs.io/css/index.json?1420139789`).
- I can't guarantee that I won't make breaking changes to the data format of the these files, or their location. When I do, I'll try to remember to let you know about it.

Currently the `docs.json` file doesn't have a unique URL (it gets deployed with a different filename every time it changes, like the other assets). I'll make `devdocs.io/docs.json` redirect to the most recent version for you this week-end. However, please make sure Zeal doesn't request that file too often (on boot is ok), since it goes through my server — not the CDN.

128,2014-10-21 12:52:12,"It used to have that, but the choice between a fully expandable width and a somewhat constrained one falls under the UX design topic, and therefore is likely to trigger several debates.

The best solution would remain to let the user decide, for instance by providing an option, or to facilitating as much as possible the customization of the layout (and other visual design aspects). There are other discussions around this idea: see #73 for example.

As a personal point of view, I agree on the fact that line lengths of phrases should not exceed some limit, which unfortunately is not the case on some wide screens if the layout simply auto-expands.

As long as I'd been using the app (which I love, by the way, don't get me wrong), it had always just expanded to the width of my browser. That set my expectation for how the app should be displayed. Then, seeing the fixed width recently, my first reaction was that it was a new issue.

I'm happy to concede that it might be more readable with the narrower width. Perhaps something like what @BenoitZugmeyer showed is a nice middle ground?

If you really want to keep the width constraint, I would recommend increasing it (to 1920 for example) since [some content](http://devdocs.io/dom_events/) simply does not fit the current width, because the original documentation is designed for wide screens.

Given the difference of opinion of how wide the content should be, maybe there should be a little switch like this in the app header:

- Stretch to fill width

Check out what sites like GitHub or Twitter do when the window is very wide. It's common practise to constrain the main body width when you only have one main content area. GitHub's content area, for example, is 980px wide. I think that would be a reasonable maximum for the DevDocs content area (not counting the sidebar).

Usually I'd just resize my browser window, but I'm currently using a project management web app that actually makes use of the width (it has a large table view with many columns), and DevDocs is just another tab in that window (I keep it pinned in Chrome so it's always ready).

I've run into this issue with Ruby applications a few times before, and I've been unable to find concise and clear instructions on how to set up a virtual environment, distro-independently, with a particular Ruby version and associated libraries.

I have a few things in mind that I'd like to add to DevDocs, aside from the ones I mentioned in #117, but the above issue keeps me from doing so, seeing as I'm not really a Ruby developer. Would it be possible to add development-environment-setup-for-dummies to the README or another document?

I'll try to improve the setup instructions but since I'm on OS X and don't have a Windows or Linux machine around, it's difficult for me to figure out instructions that work all the time. Once you have Ruby 2.1.2. and Node.js installed the commands listed on the README should complete the setup.

It would probably be a good idea to support reading Dash DocSets (if not using them for storage entirely, insofar that is feasible). This would not only allow for the use of appropriately-licensed third-party Dash sets, but would also make it easier for a project developer to submit their _own_ documentation in a structured format, rather than having to rely on a scraper (which would require maintenance when the source documentation format is changed for any reason).

The Dash format [doesn't seem to be too complicated](https://github.com/exlee/d3-dash-gen/blob/master/parse.ls), apparently it's just SQLite with XML and regular HTML/CSS/JS.
",joepie91,2015-03-29 19:28:47
117,2014-08-24 14:45:32,"Hi Sven

I agree a structured format and/or DocSet support would be great but unfortunately this isn't how DevDocs work. With DevDocs I decided to use HTML fragments embedded in the page rather than loading the entire original documents in an iframe (à la Dash). This makes the app faster (no external resources to load) and allows a consistent styling across documentations — which in my opinion help provide a better user experience — but also makes it impossible for DevDocs to support the DocSet format.

I agree this isn't great to encourage user contributions but that's a decision I made early on and can't revisit now, because the entire app is built around it (see some details about this in the [README](https://github.com/Thibaut/devdocs#app)).

Now, the idea of a structured format / format spec is one that I've had for some time. There are a couple documentations I'd like to add in the coming weeks but then I'll likely switch my focus to new features like this one. Your ideas are welcome.

In the meantime if you can find me 16x16 and 32x32 icons for bookshelf.js and knex.js I'd be happy to add both documentations to DevDocs. :)
",Thibaut,2015-03-29 19:28:47
117,2014-08-29 01:11:48,"Hmm, perhaps it would be an idea to simply have a generic DocSet-to-HTML-fragment conversion script? Basically, it doesn't necessarily have to be _served_ as a DocSet, as long as you'd be able to use it as an input format of some sort. Regardless of what DevDocs uses internally, you'd still have the benefit of easier / more streamlined maintenance.

I've attached downscaled versions of the Bookshelf logo; Knex doesn't appear to have a square icon readily available, and I've asked them to provide one. The reference for that ticket should have just popped up in here.

I didn't hit the save button at the bottom. Save buttons are becoming rare
these days.

Sorry for the bother.

BTW:
On Chrome, OSX, the address bar trick doesn't work. In the past I have
added many search engines with keywords etc.
devdocs.io doesn't work automagically and the search URL doesn't always
include a consistent slot for the search term that I could substitute with
%s

For example:
To search for a word on Thesaurus.com
http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/%s?r=76&src=ref&ch=the
where the %s is the search term

The search for ""date"" on devdocs.io is
http://devdocs.io/http/rfc2616-sec14#sec14.18

for :""regexp""

I'm tryin to make a Haskell docset, and the Haskell documentation is ridden of anchor tags.

My guess is that devdocs expects identifiers to be `id`'s on element, while in the 
Haskell documentation, they are implemented as `name`'s on `<a>` tags (which is also valid html).
",romeovs,2014-05-24 14:24:08
98,2014-05-22 08:42:06,"While testing this I also found the solution: add an id to each anchor tag with a `name` on it.

Change:
    <a name=""some-id"">..</a>

to:
    <a id=""some-id"" name=""some-id"">..</a>

This seems to work but it still think it would be nice if `name` tags work out of the box in devdocs.

77,2014-04-08 01:51:51,"On Windows 8.1 in Chrome, Firefox and IE (all edge stable versions), its not possible to use devdocs without a mouse.

For example, when landing on http://devdocs.io:
1. Search box becomes focused
2. Type in something like 'HTMLAudio' - 'HTMLAudioElement' will be the lone selected item in the search list
3. Press Enter/Return to make your selection
4. Right-side pane will load up the article for HTMLAudioElement, and search box remains selected.

Now, pressing tab while the search box is selected does nothing.

Pressing escape (with the expected behavior of de-selecting the search box) ends up clearing the search term and navigating away from the HTMLAudioElement article.

The net effect is that it's not possible to click on any of the links in the right pane without the mouse.

As a workaround I've implemented `alt+tab` to focus the first link in the right pane. You can then continue hitting `tab` (or `alt+tab` in wekbit) to focus the other links (the links in the sidebar can be focus with the arrow keys).

74,2014-03-18 21:29:40,"OpenSearch (with suggestions) would allow users to use devdocs as search provider in their web browser's native search box.

This would eliminate the need for keeping the site open on a new tab, or running the app. I already have a ton of tabs open for work, and I already have my screen real estate allocated to my code editor, the browser, Firebug, ssh terminal, and FTP.  Even on a dual-head machine, yet another application open is cumbersome.

The open search suggestions could mimic the search results shown in the left-hand panel of the site, so I have the documentation always available without adding another persistent application or tab to my workspace.

Implementation is extremely easy and lightweight, here is a brief overview: http://perishablepress.com/custom-opensearch-functionality-for-your-website/

The documentation panel does show a message explaining that the Rust docs haven't been enabled, but when you are navigating you are not looking at that: your eyes are on the nav panel.

A small pill saying ""disabled"" or similar, next to the documentation name, on the navigation panel, would make this more obvious.

51,2014-01-23 22:56:05,"The help page lists a few `Cmd` key combinations, in particular `Cmd + ←` and `Cmd + →` for navigating back and forth in history. On Windows these combinations become `Ctrl + ←` respectively `Ctrl + →`, which is highly problematic because that exact behaviour is already mapped to `Alt + ←` respectively `Alt + →`. Meanwhile, the `Ctrl` combinations have a different behaviour: to jump the cursor a full word left or right.

I haven't tested how GNU/Linux compares.

I suggest that, for Windows, the back/forth navigation shortcuts, being first-class citizens, be completely dropped. Failing that, that they be rebound to `Alt` to avoid the above confusion.

`Ctrl + Enter` (`Cmd + Enter`) does not currently interfere with anything so doesn't need special handling.

As an aside, and as a much more innocent issue, I would expect the behaviour mapped to `Alt + ↓`, `Alt + ↑` for `↓`, `↑` and `↓`, `↑` for `Ctrl + ↓`, `Ctrl + ↑`, the rationale being that the default behaviour of `↓`, `↑` is incremental scrolling and I would expect to normally have far more need of that than navigating up/down the list of items.

45,2014-01-23 22:32:21,"This appears to manifest in different ways and have numerous possibly related issues. It's an issue in IE11, too (make a search provider [here](http://www.enhanceie.com/ie/searchbuilder.asp).

Here are a few examples I expect to take me to the page labeled ""[SPL/Exceptions](http://devdocs.io/php-spl-exceptions/)"".

FF 26.0:
- `#q=`:
  - `spl exception`: Searches for `exception`. [Exception class](http://devdocs.io/php/class.exception).
  - `spl%20exception`: Searches for `exception`. [Exception class](http://devdocs.io/php/class.exception).
  - `spl/exception`: Searches for `spl/exception`. No result.
  - `splexception`: Searches for `splexception`. No result.
- Provider:
  - `spl%20exception`: Searches for `exception`. [Exception class](http://devdocs.io/php/class.exception).
  - `spl exception`: Searches for `spl+exception`. No result.
  - `spl/exception`: Searches for `spl/exception`. No result.
- Internal search:
  - `spl%20exception`: No result.
  - `spl/exception`: No result.
  - `spl exception`, type: Not possible. Space is ignored.
  - `spl exception`, paste: No result.

IE11:
- `#q=`:
  - `spl exception`: Searches for `exception`. [Exception class](http://devdocs.io/php/class.exception).
  - `spl%20exception`: Searches for `exception`. [Exception class](http://devdocs.io/php/class.exception).
  - `spl/exception`: Searches for `spl/exception`. No result.
  - `splexception`: Searches for `splexception`. No result.
- Provider:
  - `spl%20exception`: Searches for `spl%20exception`. No result.
  - `spl exception`: Searches for `spl+exception`. No result.
  - `spl/exception`: Variously searches for `spl/exception` and treats it as a URI. No result.
  - `splexception`: Searches for `splexception`. No result.
- Internal search:
  - `spl%20exception`: No result.
  - `spl/exception`: No result.
  - `spl exception`, type: Not possible. Space is ignored.
  - `spl exception`, paste: No result.
  - `splexception`: No result.

It seems that various special characters are not interpreted as expected by the fuzzy search, in addition to any encoding issues there may also be in place. I would expect:
- `/` to be treated as a literal or ignored by search.
- Spaces to be consistently stripped or allowed and possibly ignored by search.
- Query and provider arguments consistently translated to valid search terms. To this end, `%20` should probably be treated as literal space.

I have no personal experience with longest common subsequence matching but I can see the rationale in ignoring spaces. However, it seems to me that a better approach would be to ignore occurrences of spaces in the search term instead of simply stripping them during input.

When I look up, say, exceptions, it's usually because I don't know if the core library includes a fitting one already or which one that would be. In that situation I can't search directly for a _listing_ of exceptions but instead have to rely on the `Alt + r` shortcut from a particular result I know exists (which is nice for what it is but extra work for my poor, lazy fingers). A scoped search for `exception[s]` doesn't produce useful results either; far too many or too little.

tl;dr: I'd _really_ like that but I can understand if it isn't possible.

Addendum: A possible alternative interpretation of space using the provider or the query parameter could be to delimit a search scope.

If the subdomain changes between the request and the links, the scraper or processor may not properly detect that the links actually go to the same content, despite having a different domain, and treat them as external.

This isn't a major inconvenience as I can either click the link and continue on the upstream site, or I can remember that the PHP links aren't properly handled and find the article I want via search.

If you use Firefox Aurora or Nightly, this allows you to easily install devdocs cross-platform

e.g., on Mac, clicking the install will make a `devdocs.app` that you can easily launch.  Awesome!

Firefox for Android can also install this kind of app (and they will appear on the home screen like a native android app)

Let me know what you think, I have some questions within the code

For example, when looking up `event.preventDefault` you'll get a result for DOM and jQuery. When reading the documentation, there is no visual difference between the two since they're styled the same, except for the icons in the results sidebar.

I recommend adding some sort of color difference for different sources, within the documentation pages. For instance, a blue header with the jQuery logo for jQuery vs. a green header with the DOM logo for MDN DOM documentation. It'll make it very easy to tell at a glance which source you're reading from.

Second thing, i have a small usability feature request, i will describe the use case shortly.

After inserting some text in the search box (for example, ""find"") and clicking on an interesting entry (for example, jQuery ""find""), the entry's section is selected, and the search box reduces its scope just to that section (in the example case, it will search just within jQuery). I don't find easy, keyboard means to go back to a global search, aside hitting the browser back button, clicking on the bookmark again or editing the url by hand.

Since it happens often to me to jump from one section to another, i would maybe prefer that the section switch did not happen at all, but while this is arguable, i think that an easier way to get back to the global search mode may be of benefit of all kind of users.

Cheers!

When the `Esc` button is hit, also the url reflects a global state. Everything cosy and fine then!

I've done this locally and have been playing around with the front-end for it. So far the necessary changes are pretty minimal, like ensuring slugs and URLs are unique or include the version number, adding a matching CSS class for each version so they all get the correct icon, ensuring you can tab-complete different versions, those kinds of things.

Right now, no matter where focus is in the app, the up/down arrow keys change the selected item in the sidebar.

Not all users have multi-touch trackpads, and if they don't they are forced to use the browser rendered scrollbar to scroll the right hand panel up/down.

I prefer having the arrow keys always perform the same action and not worry about where the focus is. If we wanted to scroll with up/down we'd have to un-focus the search field, scroll, then put the focus back on the search field to do another search (or to open the next result).

6,2016-12-12 13:07:33,"@borekb this hasn't been implemented. I felt it's not needed because the sidebar already provides a ToC. On most pages, hitting `Alt+R` will reveal the current entry in the sidebar surrounded by related entries for that page, which acts as a ToC.

I see how an extra ToC could be useful, though, having added many docs with lots of headings that aren't entries in the sidebar. So I'll reopen this.",Thibaut,
5,2013-10-28 19:08:17,"I'd like to be able to rearrange documentations in the sidebar by dragging them in the ""Select documentation"" list. The order should also be reflected in the search (when results have identical scores).

",Thibaut,
4,2014-06-25 00:05:48,"you could also search by the categorisation in the side bar, for example:

`php: array_merge` would be a search term, which would search in the PHP documentation for array_merge

2,2013-10-28 18:56:19,"DevDocs's offline setup isn't very good, requiring people to manually install, run, and update the code. Ideally we should cache everything in the browser using a storage API.

IndexedDB is supported by most browsers but I'm not sure it can reliably store tens of thousands of files amounting to hundreds of megabytes.

Chrome also supports the FileSystem API.
