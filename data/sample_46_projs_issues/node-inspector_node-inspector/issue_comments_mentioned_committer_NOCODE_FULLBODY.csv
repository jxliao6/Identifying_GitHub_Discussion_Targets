Yes you're right. I'm also noticed that the recent node v6.4 is supporting `inspect` option. It's really good news. 
But in my case, I'm using the node in the embedded device which is pretty old version(v0.12.0). So unfortunately I can't use `inspect` option there. :(

930,2016-12-07 02:01:15,"I'd like to use this node-inspector to debug node.js remotely, But the latest code looks it needs to run node-inspector on the same machine running on the local machine.
Even though I submitted a PR (https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/pull/919) regarding this but it just supports only source viewing and break point.
In order to support other tabs like console, profile and etc, it seems like it should inject some modules to the running nodejs process via getting console object.

@bajtos 
In the case that the running nodejs process doesn't have console object because it substitutes for the other, node-inspect cannot inject modules into.
If injection is not available, the node-inspector cannot support forwarding console output, tabs functions like profile/console/etc.
But I'd like to use this project only for view source and setting break-point except other features.
So may I distribute this as another project name ? (maybe `node-inspector-remote` ?)
I just want to do this through forking the old node-inspect branch.

> Question: Is the idea to Fork the DevTools front-end in order to support

No, we won't to design our own plugins system for DevTools.

This is a first step of complex plugin system for Node Inspector.
We have three levels, where we want to inject code: frontend, inspector's backend, application.
This PR implements entry point to be able to load plugins to frontend.
So you have full access to DevTools sources, i.e. you can use `chrome extension APIs` or modify internal devtools methods.

627,2015-05-25 10:08:38,"@bajtos ,

We use `front-end-node` as a folder with all overrides, but we store all overrides relative to `/node` path.

Main reason to remove `InspectorBackendCommands` from `front-end` - cleanup this folder from any changes. After this step there will no files, which we need to copy to `front-end` folder using `update-front-end` script.

But if we simple move `InspectorBackendCommands` to `front-end-node` folder, this doen't work, because it will be resolved as `/node/InspectorBackendCommands.js`, but we expect `/InspectorBackendCommands.js`

621,2015-07-01 14:28:19,"@marcominetti , I'm not familiar with search API in DevTools, but if I understand right main problem - we receive lot of parallel requests like `searchInContent` and we try to require sources for each `scriptId` also in parallel mode. So, we need to review strategy of original DevTools, when there exists a linked local folder:
- If in this case DevTools tries to search in all files (not only in loaded to front-end), then we need to completely avoid `getScriptSourceById` and use `fs` (this makes some problems for generated scripts, but I prefer to ignore this problems in initial implementation)
- Otherwise we can move search logic to app (look at injection example in `ConsoleAgent`)

In all this cases we need to completely avoid caching.

582,2015-03-10 11:09:43,"Hello, @marcominetti . I'm not sure that making `babel` a part of `node-inspector` is a right thing.
But this is a good point to start extended discussion about plugins.
For example, we have [one other](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/issues/502) feature issue, about highlighting `debug` module colors in console, but this is useful only for users that use `debug` module in their projects, so this can't be implemented as main part of node-inspector.

I'd like to provide to users simple way to extend `ni` by plugins.
This is a work on two-three fronts:
1. frontend extension
2. inspector backend extension
3. [app extension]

Your current pr takes only first part. So, how I see frontend extension mechanism:
1. We can store all plugins in subdirectory with same name. Example:


1. Each plugin has name in npm `node-inspector-<plugin name>`. Example `node-inspector-babel`
2. Each plugin has `module.json`, like [this](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/blob/frontend/front-end-node/module.json), [inspector.json](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/blob/frontend/front-end-node/inspector.json) and optionally [protocol.json](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/blob/frontend/front-end-node/protocol.json). We need to compile extension structure on node-inspector startup, or for each new [ws session](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/blob/master/lib/debug-server.js#L20-L23)
3. Add new paths to [express router](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/blob/frontend/lib/debug-server.js#L61-L64), like



Where `compiled_in_memory_inspectorjson` is the result of something like this:



So for example if we have `babel` plugin:
`cd node-inspector/plugins/babel`
`echo module.json`



`BabelPlugin.js` is your current diff for overrides.

`echo inspector.json`



`echo protocol.json`



And `compiled_in_memory_inspectorjson` is equal to:



We need to compile same way `protocol.json`.

So, @marcominetti , are you ready to implement plugin system? This work is relative to `frontend` pr. Unfortunately in current time I work on other `ni` issues, and can't finish `frontend` pr at soon, but I'm ready to review prs relative to it.
So keep in mind that this is a discussion about plugins, and your thoughts are important.

",3y3,bajtos
582,2015-03-12 17:20:48,"@3y3 @bajtos ...a solution could be integrate npm (through npm link instead of having it in ni deps) and just look for every node module - installed locally (cwd) and globally - that matches node-inspector-plugin-xxx name.

IMO the naming convention could be:
- node-inspector-xxx: custom inspector bundled with plugins (out of scope for the plugin system feature
- node-inspector-plugin-xxx: plugin that extends ni and contains the module.json, protocol.json and inspector.json and related files

At load time, ni will find the matching node-inspector-plugin-xxx modules, read jsons and create proper static express paths for frontend files. In this case I would suggest to define a dedicated frontend/backend folders within the xxx plugin to avoid security concers of serving backend files to the frontend.

To sum up:



The same for npm installed modules:



In case of naming conflicts (same plugin embedded in ni /plugins folder and available as npm installed pkg), the ni embedded wins (cause npm installed pkg could update and break currently installed ni).

In module.json could be useful to add - by specification - a property for supported ni version(s). This property could be checked with semver during load phase.

Any thoughts?

566,2015-03-04 10:35:25,"Hi @bajtos, I just tried out some possible solutions for this feature. I came across a very obvious solution: if the node-inspector page encounters an active breakpoint, the node-inspector's javascript code can just do an alert('breakpoint encountered'); in the javascript code, and the Chrome browser will automatically switch to the node-inspector tab!

Btw, it would be handy if you can enable/disable this alert with a config option e.g. in the settings.
",wdbacker,bajtos
566,2015-03-05 10:06:47,"Hi @bajtos @3y3, I found a much more elegant solution. As node-inspector needs only works on Chrome or Opera, we can use the new desktop notification API.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification/Using_Web_Notifications

Advantages:
- notification is much more discrete (no alert neede anymore)
- the old alert() blocks the javascript event loop, the new notification doesn't
- no configuration needed in node-inspector, user can simply (dis)allow notification once in node-inspector

I made a small demo page with script code that can be used immediately for node-inspector too.

To see how this works, go to http://srm.stabe.be/ and click on the button. After 5 seconds, Chrome will ask once if you want to allow desktop notifications for this ""website"". If you press ""allow"", the notification will be displayed bottom-right.

Now push the same button a second time and immediately switch to another window/tab in Chrome. After 5 seconds, you'll see the notification bottom-right and you can click on it. You'll be taken immediately to the node-inspector tab!

Btw, the notification script on the demo page is browser independent (the script uses feature checking). You just need Chrome 32 or later, Opera 25 or later for this new feature to work seamlessly, see 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification#Browser_compatibility

You'll see the code needed for node-inspector in the page source of my demo page.
What do you think?

560,2015-04-14 07:07:50,"@bajtos , this partially ready to review.

Strategy of this pr:
1. Refactor session module. Inherit it from EventEmitter.
2. Restructure all modules to receive `session` object instead of `debuggerClient, frontendClient etc.`
3. Fix test after refactoring
4. Fix test for 0.12 - to be sure that we work on 0.12 with new changes (there are some speculative changes. I need help to understand how they work)
5. Emit `resource-tree` event from session instead of PageAgent. Rename to `resource-tree-resolved`
6. Add new tests for `resource-tree-resolved` feature

About fixes for 0.12:
Ok, I can understand why we need to resume debugger after injections [like there](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/commit/c95736904bdf37987c4115710bbb381ac17937c0#diff-78792a5f176ac27c2f69d3b51e9c0b1bR200) - this is related to new isolated debugger with his own event loop.
But that happens [here](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/commit/c95736904bdf37987c4115710bbb381ac17937c0#diff-e26d3be456d1f6213df7d90212089743R165), how it's possible what `fn` is undefined?
I inspect this situation long time:
- If you try to pass all tests without this change - failure any time

In https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/issues/498#issuecomment-72928660, you write:

> The issue in my case came from giant glob results (cost ~40s) and subseqent filtering (cost ~2 min!) on the backend.

And here you say

> delays on deep symlinked projects are now acceptable (~5s instead of ~5min).

I'd like to understand better how did we arrive at 5 seconds. Is it because you run node-debug with symlinks disabled? Or is it because the new glob version with `**/**/*` is faster than the old glob version following all symlinks?

What is the breakdown of glob + filtering times in your project with this patch applied and when symlinks are and are not followed?

In general, I try to make Node Inspector work out of the box for as many projects as possible and keep the number of configuration options low. If we can get a similar improvement by fixing the filtering algorithm instead of disabling symlink follows, then I would much more prefer that solution.

---

Another important fact related to symlinks and `findAllApplicationScripts`: The only reason why we try to find all scripts at the beginning is to allow NI users to set breakpoints in files that are not loaded in V8. However, when you have symlinks in your project, these breakpoints don't work anyway, because UI shows a symlink while V8 uses the resolved real path - see #370.

If you don't need to set breakpoints in files that are not loaded in V8 yet, then you can run Node Inspector with `--no-preload`: it disables `findAllApplicationScripts` and thus the startup should be pretty quick.
",bajtos,jldec
550,2015-02-05 13:35:25,"Hi @bajtos 
simply using the latest 'glob' module stops symlink exploration and there is no way to re-enable it. This is probably fine for most users of NI. With just that change i am able to start NI in under a second on my project, but i can't see files in directories below modules which are local via `npm link`. 

the `/**/**/*` pattern is a slightly hackish solution which tells glob to search one extra level of directories (even inside symlinked modules) but it does slow things down. Most NI users won't need it, so i thought it would be best to make it optional with the `-s` option.

this PR also adds a little debug instrumentation under the name `node-inspector:ScriptFileStorage`. Here is a example of the output without `-s`.



The glob took ~614ms and the filter ~135ms

With `-s` the output looks like this:



In this case the glob took ~4s and the filter 279ms
",jldec,bajtos
550,2015-02-06 08:49:33,"@jldec I am still not convinced that the root cause is in symlinks. In my opinion, the problem is in the high number of files in node_modules dependencies.

What happens if you `npm pack && npm install` your dependencies instead of `npm link`? Will this pull request fix the startup time for you? My guess is that it won't.

I would like to improve the current `--preload`/`--no-preload` config option to take a glob pattern specifying which files to preload. This pattern can be `!node_modules/**/**/*` by default.

> So until #370 is fixed, i would suggest simply updating NI to use the latest glob and leave it at that. This would at least protect against the circular symlink trap.

Circular symlink trap - is that the reason why the current version of `glob` takes so long in your project?

Let's implement your proposal then - update to the latest glob and stop following symlinks. While I am concerned that such solution may bite us in the future, it is improving the situation in the short term, thus it's worth the risk.

Just make sure the commit message clearly describes the breaking change it introduces.
",bajtos,jldec
550,2015-02-06 13:54:26,"@bajtos - Yes, circular symlinks was the main cause of the long delays in my case.

I agree that given #370, bumping the glob version which disables symlink following is the right solution for now. I will post a separate PR for that.

Hopefully having an up-to-date glob version is another small incentive for some NI user to contribute fixes (a) to enable glob to return realpaths  and (b) to enable symlink following in glob (with cycle detection)

I also like your suggestion of using a glob pattern for the NI preload option

My intention is to enable the MDNS broadcasting out of the box, in order to minimize the workflow, but I understand the added security risk of binding to a addressable IP. 

Alternatively we could add a command-line flag that would enable MDNS broadcasting, the user could flip when running `node-debug` and `node-inspector`? That way it's explicit.

I can solve this by using [Config.filterNodeDebugOptions](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/blob/config/lib/config.js#L188-L201), but I specially allow to node-inspector to see full configuration, bacause now I work on GUI configuration system (I'll add new tab to Settings Screen) that needs to know about all options. I'll open discussion pr about GUI configuration on weekend with start small example.

It is preserved. Help information [is different for node-debug and node-inspector](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/blob/config/lib/config.js#L264-L276)

I will try to divide it on parts on weekend, but I'm not sure what it's possible:

Main target of commit ""Collect configuration in one place"", this place is `config.js`, therefore I removed configuration part from `node-debug`. Sinchronously I need to add this part to `config` and handle this options. [I need to collect script options for `node-debug` in one place](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/blob/config/bin/node-debug.js#L72), for this reason I add [script](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/blob/config/lib/config.js#L109-L119) option to configuration. Also for reason ""I need handle optins of `node-debug`"" I uses `yargs` in `config` and check the defaults for `node-debug`.

1. Injector API is stable, it works fine in Profiler API pr
2. Profiler API pr is also ready to a review
3. HeapProfiler API works fine, but here is not implemented `getObjectByHeapObjectId`.
(This command works as `lookup` in context of heap snapshot).
HeapProfiler can work without this command, but I prefer to implement it.
Simplest implementation of this command can crash node process if HeapObjectId is link to internal v8 structure, therefor I need to inspect all valid value types that can be returned.
After this pr will be done.
4. @bajtos , if you understand that is `objectGroup` in terminology of V8, can you explain me? 
If no - I need to start big research for this issue.

This is my understanding: to work around the mirror cache being cleared every time the debugger resumes execution, the front-end is manually keeping track of which mirror objects are used by the front-end. When you dump DevTools protocol communication in Chrome, you'll see messages like `releaseObjectGroup` - that's a signal to the back-end to release all mirror objects associated with the given object group. Requests like `evaluate` and `evaluateOnCallFrame` include an option `objectGroup` to indicate which object group should be used to store the mirror objects from the response. The object group is a sort of an instance of mirror cache, except there can be multiple instances and their life-time is managed by front-end.

There is also `releaseObject` method that can be used to release an individual object that is not associated with any object group.

Does it makes sense? Let me know if you have more questions.

@bajtos , thanks for response, I also inspected this question and now I have a crazy idea to add to the project `InjectedScript` from webkit.

385,2014-06-20 00:31:07,"My thoughts:
- Should not give much thought about inconsistent line separators, they will have to be normalized as it is impossible to map each line separator between old source and new source code, seeing as line separators can be inserted and deleted via node inspector editor.
- When the line separator style can't be determined (e.g. no line separators in old content or mixed line separators), Could default to [`os.EOL`](http://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_eol). Another (slightly crazy) idea would be to use an [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file's `end_of_line` setting, though supporting only a single property of EditorConfig seems rather unorthodox, and I wouldn't consider node inspector as an actual code editor. It would be more plausible to have a RC option which overrides the auto-detection.
- Side-effects of taking an approach similar to @3y3's: I can't think of any possible side-effect seeing as literal line separators cannot appear inside string/regex literals (and [CR/LF/CRLF are normalized to LF in ES6 template strings](https://github.com/rwaldron/tc39-notes/blob/d5ac441f29812ee269c173c277ea34be88efa02a/es6/2013-09/sept-17.md#58-line-terminators-in-template-strings-should-they-be-normalized)). Correct me if I'm wrong.

351,2014-04-22 12:08:23,"> @bajtos , please see the build history on travis for this PR. It's very unstable.

It takes quite long time to download the nodewebkit binary, that's probably the reason why the build sometimes fails.

Few more thoughts:
1. It seems the debugged process is not correctly terminated when node-webkit executable is not found. When I run node-debug multiple times, I started to get `Failed to open socket on port 5858, waiting 1000 ms before retrying`, which means there was another node process already listening on 5858.
2. The path to node-webkit executable is wrong. This is what works for me: 
   
   
3. Command-line option `-nw` is not user friendly. node-debug should either:
   1. Always use node webkit when it is present. Use `open` when it was not found and print a warning, so that user knows there is a problem.
   2. Or provide a configuration file where the user can set what browser he wants to use (`open`, `nw`, path-to-Opera, etc.)
4. Since the nodewebkit is such a big module, it seems like a bad idea to make it a required dependency. Perhaps we can check if there is `nodewebkit` or `nw` executable available and print instructions how to install node webkit if it is not?

What's your opinion? What looks like the best solution to _you_?

I see your point. Let's rename `no-preload` to `preload` completely, as you suggested earlier.

The rc file should still support `noPreload` or `no-preload` for backwards compatibility (I am not sure which one is used). A warning could be printed when old key is encountered, to let users know they should use `preload` instead. That will allow us to remove the support of the old key (`no-preload` or `noPreload`) at some point in the future.

It would be nice to describe the possibility of using `--no-preload` instead of `--preload=false` in the help, but I can live without that.

Is this a reasonable solution?

261,2013-12-16 14:55:10,"Hello @sergkr, thank you for reporting the issue.

If you feel like hacking on this yourself, you can start by looking at `convert.v8RefToInspectorObject` in [lib/convert.js](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/blob/master/lib/convert.js#L69) to see if there is enough information coming from the V8 debugger.
",bajtos,sergkr
261,2013-12-17 04:44:24,"@bajtos, I'll be happy to contribute, but I need a bit of help getting set up.

I was able to clone the repo and get it up and running (and I verified that all existing tests pass).  Now I'd like to figure out how I can use node-inspector to debug node-inspector (so that ideally, I could set a breakpoint in the convert.v8RefToInspectorObject function and investigate what information I have available to me when converting a Date).

I'm going through the [Debugging the Debugger](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/wiki/Debugging-the-debugger) wiki article, which is generally great, but I'm having trouble with some of the steps in the ""Debugging the back-end"" section - and ultimately, I wasn't able to get the second node-inspector instance up and running.  I'm confused where some of those port numbers are coming from, and suspect the article might be a little out of date.

Here are the parts I'm confused about:

> 1. browse to (1) http://localhost:8124

I'm assuming port 8124 is the port that test/hello.js is running on?  So this step is basically just running the original app, correct?  If so, I'm good so far.

> 1. browse to (2) http://localhost:8080

If I go to localhost:8000 directly, I just see a message that says ""Cannot GET /"".  Should this actually be: `localhost:8080/debug?port=5858`?  If so, I'm good so far.

> 1. browse to (3) http://localhost:9090

All right, so this is where I'm stuck.  Again, going to localhost:9090 just gets me ""Cannot GET /"", so I'm again assuming that should be `localhost:9090/debug?port=5858`.  However, when I go there, I get this:

![9090](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/766698/1761552/4bd78740-66d3-11e3-97c7-4232c6a08543.png)

Well, there _is_ in fact another debugger client attached to port 5858 - that would be (2), which was started in step 3.  I thought I might try running (3) on another port instead, using the `--debug-port` command line option, so I tried doing a revised version of step 5:



However, that doesn't seem to work - going to `http://127.0.0.1:9090/debug?port=5959` results in this:

![5959](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/766698/1761570/99893b22-66d4-11e3-808e-584f2de03677.png)

First of all, take a look at the discussion in #191, especially this [comment](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/pull/191#discussion_r5660174):

> (the naming scheme)
> - config.json uses camel-case names only (this preserves compatibility with older installations)
> - command-line arguments and RC files use dashed names only (this is the new way for the future)

Looking at the current implementation, it seems like you should change `collectDefaultsFromDefinitions` to use dash-style keys, which is the style returned by `collectDefaultsFromJSONConfig()` and expected down the line in `rc()` defaults. Instead of changing `collectDefaultsFromJSONConfig()` to return camel-case keys.

Back to your issue:

> the order of key appear is unknow and I experience that my own configuration file in $HOME will be override by the global one.

If I understand your change correctly, then your change will completely disable default values from config.json. It fixes the problem only because there will be no merging anymore.

It would be very helpful if you could describe how to reproduce your problem. An automated unit-test would be even better.

I like your Grunt module, it looks like a useful addition to Grunt workflow.

However, Node Inspector's README is not the right place for documenting other modules like grunt-node-inspector. I would suggest you to copy the relevant part of Node Inspector's README to grunt-node-inspector's README and make the change there.

As far as my understanding of Grunt and grunt-node-inspector goes, users cannot use commad-line arguments to configure Node Inspector started by grunt-node-inspector, they have to use grunt config object instead. In which case your proposed change would result in an misleading documentation.

Opener is only one of ways to open Node Inspector. 
For example I use the old style way `node-inspector app.js`. For this reason I think that best solution:
- Add new command to [FrontendClient](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/blob/master/lib/FrontendClient.js) (like `updateTitle`)
- Add handler for this command to [Overrides](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/blob/master/front-end-node/Overrides.js)

29,2013-12-30 21:52:47,"@bajtos It appears that the code in `/lib/convert.js` actually has nothing to do with it. After changing the limit to 1000 and generating a long string:

![truncation](http://i.imgur.com/Po2dwM7.png)

The same result occurs when removing the limit entirely.

It appears as though some code deep inside the inspector itself is performing the truncation at 80 characters. I found [some reference to this in DebuggerClient](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/blob/master/lib/DebuggerClient.js#L127) when using `JSON.stringify`. Perhaps somebody who knows more about the inspector could help.
",STRML,bajtos
29,2013-12-31 05:48:54,"It looks like this is due to a default limitation in the v8 debugger. The default max string length is defined [here](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/a3216d885fcfcb38a6eae301fe9680b82ccc3269/src/mirror-debugger.js#L164) which limits all String type response messages to 80 characters. The formatted message we see in the console is produced by v8 [here](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/a3216d885fcfcb38a6eae301fe9680b82ccc3269/src/mirror-debugger.js#L564)

Luckily there is a way to pass an option in the request message which can extend the message response length for Strings.

I believe the change in Node inspector requires two things 
1. We need to add a maxStringLength property value to this [object](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/blob/01cb658ce253bfbc4bedd8e72dc1ffe9c13ffa05/lib/DebuggerAgent.js#L366-L369)
   ( V8 side of things handles this [here](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/a3216d885fcfcb38a6eae301fe9680b82ccc3269/src/debug-debugger.js#L1429) )
   Not sure what the max length should be set to but something like 1000 would be good enough and maybe a option in the config?
2. we also need to change this [line](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/blob/01cb658ce253bfbc4bedd8e72dc1ffe9c13ffa05/lib/convert.js#L137) to become `description: String(result.value)` otherwise it will still output the limited text

I tested this with my local node inspector and it worked :) 

@bajtos I wanted to discuss point 2 above as I'm not sure what impact on other dependencies that change will have?
",pflannery,bajtos
29,2013-12-31 12:51:50,"@pflannery Thanks for your deep investigation. The proposed solutions looks good, I'd prefer to set maxStringLength to a higher value (10k or 100k) and do not add a new config option for now.

As for the second point, the change should be fine. Just verify that the content of `result.value` indicates that the value is incomplete when V8 truncates the string, ideally in a new unit-test.

This issue affects `RuntimeAgent` methods calling `evaluate` request too, the pull request should fix those too. Please consider extracting the shared code into a new method in `DebuggerClient` to prevent further code duplication.

> I also think it's a waste of everybody's time when every debugger [...] has to reimplement (and keep maintaining) the same **DevTools->V8 protocol bridge**.

`node-inspector` doesn't actually expose the WebKit / DevTools ""Remote Debugging API"". I've tried listening for events and sending commands with `chrome-remote-interface`, and neither worked (it did connect), I can only assume because it's only exposing the necessary APIs and then bridging them to the V8 Debugging Protocol.

My best (ignorant) guess is that right now, `node-inspector`'s ""front-end"" is mimicking the actual WebKit Remote Debugging Protocol calls (e.g., when a breakpoint is set in the UI) with V8 Debugging Protocol calls, which is why it is impossible to set a breakpoint in the source mapped file (since it's purely a UI abstraction and has no parallel in the V8 Debugging Protocol).

This is because we don't receive `afterCompile` event, that registers scripts in ScriptManager.
Isntead of this we receive `compileError` event every time.

So in this pr I deprecate event caching feature in BreakEventHandler.

582,2015-03-10 11:09:43,"Hello, @marcominetti . I'm not sure that making `babel` a part of `node-inspector` is a right thing.
But this is a good point to start extended discussion about plugins.
For example, we have [one other](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/issues/502) feature issue, about highlighting `debug` module colors in console, but this is useful only for users that use `debug` module in their projects, so this can't be implemented as main part of node-inspector.

I'd like to provide to users simple way to extend `ni` by plugins.
This is a work on two-three fronts:
1. frontend extension
2. inspector backend extension
3. [app extension]

Your current pr takes only first part. So, how I see frontend extension mechanism:
1. We can store all plugins in subdirectory with same name. Example:


1. Each plugin has name in npm `node-inspector-<plugin name>`. Example `node-inspector-babel`
2. Each plugin has `module.json`, like [this](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/blob/frontend/front-end-node/module.json), [inspector.json](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/blob/frontend/front-end-node/inspector.json) and optionally [protocol.json](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/blob/frontend/front-end-node/protocol.json). We need to compile extension structure on node-inspector startup, or for each new [ws session](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/blob/master/lib/debug-server.js#L20-L23)
3. Add new paths to [express router](https://github.com/3y3/node-inspector/blob/frontend/lib/debug-server.js#L61-L64), like



Where `compiled_in_memory_inspectorjson` is the result of something like this:



So for example if we have `babel` plugin:
`cd node-inspector/plugins/babel`
`echo module.json`



`BabelPlugin.js` is your current diff for overrides.

`echo inspector.json`



`echo protocol.json`



And `compiled_in_memory_inspectorjson` is equal to:



We need to compile same way `protocol.json`.

So, @marcominetti , are you ready to implement plugin system? This work is relative to `frontend` pr. Unfortunately in current time I work on other `ni` issues, and can't finish `frontend` pr at soon, but I'm ready to review prs relative to it.
So keep in mind that this is a discussion about plugins, and your thoughts are important.

To @bajtos :
The current problem - now we receive `debug` event when app started with `--debug-brk` flag, previously we only check that the application is paused. But the initial problem - we can receive a `debug` event before all sources have been downloaded, in this situation [BreakEventHandler._onBreak](https://github.com/node-inspector/node-inspector/blob/master/lib/BreakEventHandler.js#L66-L68) works incorrectly.

I see two ways to fix this problem:
1) Cache all incoming events from app, before all sources will loaded in ScriptManager. We already do same thing with all incoming from frontend. In this way I prefer to emit `resource-tree` event not from `PageAgent` but from `process`.
2) Make `BreakEventHandler._onBreak` async and try to request source from app on the fly (with caching the response)

This is a first in big series of pull requests, where I'll reimplement all agents to use WebKit protocol (this is relative to mail discussion, where Brandon Meck promises to implement this protocol in node)
How you can see I deleted some incompatible tests, I would like to see on their place autogenerated tests based on `tools/protocol.json`

Is there something with which you are disagree? Any ideas about changing structure of this commit, which can help you in review?

That happens when you move the repo between github org. I am not an owner of node-inspector org thus I can't fix the permissions for you.

1. Runs node-inspector.
2. Runs the supplied script in debug mode or starts a REPL session
3. Opens the user's browser, pointing it at the inspector.

Add a CLI script `run-repl` (used by `node-debug`) that will load
the module in CWD and start a REPL session.

The script `node-debug` is friendly to embedders, error messages use the value of the env variable ""CMD"" when referring to $0.

/to: @sam-github please review. I'll submit the documentation changes in a standalone pull request.

The file node-debug.js is based on [strong-cli/lib/commands/debug.js](https://github.com/strongloop/strong-cli/blob/master/lib/commands/debug.js). The most notable difference is the naming of command-line arguments. I have decided to use the names that are already used by Node and Node Inspector (e.g. `--web-port` instead of `--port`, `--debug-brk` instead of `--suspend`). I have added aliases to keep backwards compatibility with `slc debug`.
