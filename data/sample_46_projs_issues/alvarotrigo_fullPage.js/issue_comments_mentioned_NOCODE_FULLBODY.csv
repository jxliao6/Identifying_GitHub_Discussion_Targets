I replied you already [in stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/41869810/1081396).

Your question is related with this [other open issue](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/2494) regarding the mouse wheel callbacks.

As I said in stackoverflow, you might want to try [legargy.js](https://github.com/d4nyll/lethargy) which was build with that single purpose in mind. Then you can deal with the touch events by yourself? 
fullPage.js is a much bigger framework and if you are not planning to use any of its features besides the scroll event, you might find it easier to just go with another solution. 

In case you are planning to use some kind of fading effect, you can also check the [fading extension](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/fading-effect.html).

I'll close the issue as it's a duplicate of  https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/2494",alvarotrigo,katerlouis

Also, I guess it would be better to make it optional.

According to [Chrome docs](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5093566007214080) events are treated as passive by default. In fact, this is why [this other fullPage.js issue ](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/2311) was raised.
It seems your Chrome is interpreting the event listener as passive. But clearly mine doesn't and neither the ones in Browserstack.  I would say that a default installation of Chrome wouldn't treat events by default as passive.

So the problem is clearly in your Chrome.
Check out [this docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1II7oSIpd8pK91V5kEM3tDLKcIj398jOJn8Niqy6_loI/edit) and see how you can change the default behaviour of Chrome for passive events by accessing your chrome flags: `chrome://flags` and changing the property `

Still wondering if there's a way to disable or hide the URL hash changes...?

I'll just add a summary of my solution...  (and here is the page, if anyone is interested in seeing:  http://www.coffeerepublic.com.au/products/cafina/  -  just click on any of the ""Enquire"" buttons to see the anchor working)

Basically, I needed to go through the loop of my ""product detail"" sections that appear above the ""Enquiry"" form section.  While the loop is going, I needed to add an incrementing ""data-anchor"" property to each section.  Once that was incrementing and adding a ""data-anchor=""product-detail-x"" to each one, then I could effectively link to the ""enquiry"" section (data-anchor=""enquiry"").  There was no need for an array of anchors in the ""anchors"" property of the fullpage.js function.

So then because of my floating sticky header, (and the fact that fullpage.js wants to scroll so that the bottom of the anchored section hits the bottom of the viewport) - I needed to add a custom function in the ""afterLoad"" callback:



The enquire section needed a unique ID different than the (data-anchor=""enquiry"") on that section in order for me to run a scrollTop on it.
Also, ""headerHeight"" is obviously a variable that is set higher up - which basically takes a reading on how tall the header is.

I don't know if that will help anyone, but that's what I had to do to get it to work.
",JoshCarey,alvarotrigo
2006,2016-05-11 19:20:18,"@shuhu3 I also used animate.css with fullPage.js - and wanted to have the animations reset upon revisiting a section.

What I ended up doing to reset the animations was in the afterLoad function - use jQuery **clone** to identically duplicate the objects with the class **animated** and then remove / re-append them ( as detailed in this post: [CSS-Tricks: Restart CSS Animation](https://css-tricks.com/restart-css-animation/)

This achieves the desired animation repeat that you're looking for.

Yes, you are right.
The iframe I have put inside my web page is not full screen. And, I load the fullpage.js inside the iframe.
Value of the _""display""_ property of the iframe is _""none""_ when the page is loading.
I want to show the iframe after the web page has been loaded.

However, when the page is loaded, the problem appeared：
**1. there is no animation any more**
**2. the ""#fp-nav"" does not appear**

I think it would be better from a user experience point of view to have the controls for scrolling the sections up or down **not** to scroll with the sections.

Meaning the controls should stay fixed at the top or bottom, left or right, while the section changes.

I was trying to do just that and use a fixed element for navigation while not hiding content under that fixed element that is taken from the document flow through its fixed property. So I have come up with [a solution](https://jsfiddle.net/gvsasrnw/), though it is just a draft really, nothing more, you could surly improve on it.

$(document).ready(function() {

I know that ""return false;"" cancels scrolling. It's the only way I could get the fp-auto-height section to not scroll to the bottom. I thought for sure the following would work:
                if(nextIndex == 5 && direction == 'down'){
                                        $.fn.fullpage.setFitToSection(false);

(Tested on iOS 8 and the latest 9)

I was not able to see that in your videos. Maybe you are using the mouse wheel rather than the finger (pressing with the mouse) to scroll?

The innerHeight solution that you propose would hide part of the site behind the bottom action bar.
",alvarotrigo,rodriguez-alex
1660,2015-11-20 16:36:15,"Hey @alvarotrigo, the reason you see the scrollbar come up is because you are swiping up rather quickly (we've done this test multiple times). If you scroll up slowly, then you will see that it stays disappeared. Us developers have gotten used to just rolling through things, ha!

If you scroll down a little, then scroll up slowly, say if a user is reading or is trying to see details of something, OR if they scroll down a bit and notice they don't like the content and scroll back up then the bar will stay hidden.

I recommend we also implement a check when the user switches between slides to verify the fp-section is the same as the innerHeight. As of now, we've manually added this into the afterLoad callback. This should be baked into the plugin. I'll add it into the develop pull request. Apologies on adding it to master here, first time doing a pull request :) Will update in an hour or two.

Could you revert those changes as well? Keeping them absolute helps in case some sites copy the readme content into theirs or even for sites such as [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fullpage.js) which extracts the docs from github. I prefer them to always link to the github docs.

If you revert those last changes and the CSS ones I'll merge it.  Feel free to create a new pull request for clarify.

What I suggest as a middle ground is to remove it from the `default` task and just have the developer run the sass task manually before running the compression tasks.

1522,2015-09-21 07:51:17,"@kaiserhase How are you loading content into your app? Are the slides initializing with ng-repeat? I [made an angular directive](https://github.com/hellsan631/angular-fullpage.js) that might interest you, and should cover most basic support for using fullpage with angular. I've been able to solve some issues, but the one I have trouble with is dynamic DOM changes and how to react to them.

Angular can dynamically change the DOM based on what ever events the developer wants. In order to react to these changes, I currently have to [destroy and re-initialize](https://github.com/hellsan631/angular-fullpage.js/blob/master/angular-fullpage.js#L25) the entire plugin. I've looked at the docs for `$.fn.fullpage.reBuild()` and I would imagine this might work, but I haven't had any luck with it actually updating the DOM structure. 

Example: I want to bind a click event to a button that adds a slide dynamically on page. In order for fullPage.js to recognize that this new slide (added to the DOM after a click event) exists, my thoughts are that I should be calling `$.fn.fullpage.reBuild()` instead of `destroy('all')`, correct?

Yet when I do this, nothing happens. Currently, I am using a work around that tracks the current page/slide and after a destroy/build cycle, it will move to the last page/slide, but this takes up several plugin functions and the animations still happen (even though i'm using a silent move-to for some reason). 

An example of this can be [found here](http://hellsan631.github.io/angular-fullpage.js/), under second slide.

That function will only take into account changes you made inside sections / slides. Not in the number of slides or sections you have.
The purpose of the function is mainly to provide users who use `scrollOverflow:true` a way to update the DOM and then tell fullpage.js that the scroll bar for that section needs to be updated.

So I change the code adding the ""offset"" option with value 0 by default.

Then I change this:
 var windowsHeight = $window.height();

To this:
 var windowsHeight = $window.height() - options.offset;

and in the function ""init()"" I added:
if (options.offset) {

    container.height(container.height() - options.offset);

The plugin looks for the position of the next or previous section to scroll. It position in the Y axys its determined by its top. When you open your menu the position in the screen of the sections changes and `position()` will provide a wrong value.

It is not an ideal solution.

You can try to apply it to the new code in fullPage.js by following the instructions I detailed in stackoverflow.

If you do not manage to do so and you really need it, [contact me](http://alvarotrigo.com/#contact-page) for a customisation of fullpage.js.

The `paddingTop` option seems to have the vertically centred div compensate for the offset, while with just using a CSS class it doesn't compensate.

1277,2016-09-08 01:09:52,"Hi alvarotrigo

Thanks for the info. We are already using responsiveWidth and responsiveHeight in our solution on initialisation... sorry that was assumed. However we found that it didn't always switch mode in every resize scenario on every browser. This is why we do both. We force the interchange regardless of the scenario. It could that the two issues are interrelated. We're using horizontal sections, vertical slides and have a page that on moderate sized resolutions needs to vertically scroll, before we drop into responsive. This means we have both page based auto scrolling and in slide manual scrolling.

Happy to say the issue is way way we're using your framework, or that we're leaving the boundaries for which it was designed, but we can't pin it down yet.

That said we'll integrate 2.8.6 into our next build, run a battery of tests and let you know the outcome.

Hi. I really love your art. this should be called as an art. .. I'm not at all related to this field, by which I meant codings, programmings. I'm not even a designer, I 'm just a painter. 

I love your script, and used it for my website. with pagepiling.js, but since it doesn't support for the mobile to scroll on long section i was looking for a solution. and then, now I found this fullpage.js that has the scrollable feature working perfectly.

## 

I found that, that pinch thing works totally fine on ""normal scroll demo"". 
and I found fullpage's feature that automatically moves the section to fit on the screen after a few seconds. 

So I think , if I could setup that 'a few seconds' like 0.1 millie secs, and then make that 'fitting-to-the screen-feature' to active immediately after touch fingers are off the screen. 

I imagine this would, work pretty much like non-normal-scroll-demo pages, but I can still use the pinch zoom, and double finger events...

1066,2015-03-09 14:52:03,"@eamodio yeah. I agree with you. Although I believe some of those strings shouldn't be constants, such as:
- body 
-  #fp-nav li
-  #fp-nav li a
- .fp-tableCell, .fp-slidesContainer
- #fp-nav, .fp-slidesNav, .fp-controlArrow
- .fp-controlArrow.fp-next
- .fp-controlArrow.fp-prev

Having combinations of selectors which are only used in specific cases, such as the `controls` one (`'#fp-nav, .fp-slidesNav, .fp-controlArrow`) doesn't seem to be very useful for me when they can done by combining those constants. 
I see it useful though for other cases such as `activeSlide` or `activeSection` which are widely used.

There's no way to define what a tablet or a phone is. So you'd better clear your mind about why you want to have a non autoscrolling site for ""mobile phones and tablets"". 
If its a matter of resolution, then use it as a way to differentiate both and based on that, use one or another initialization. 

The plugin can't just know what you mean with ""tablet or phone"". It provides the option `responsive` to turn on the normal scrolling based on the `width`. So you can start with that if its a matter of resolution.

941,2015-05-18 09:27:34,"@Canubiz I think that might cause problems in devices with kinetic scrolling such as Apple track-pads. They might have difficulties scrolling down because of the scrolling inertia and they will have to stop scrolling for more than 750 milliseconds. 
",alvarotrigo,Canubiz
941,2015-05-18 15:24:47,"@alvarotrigo Thanks for your feedback. I developed this modification on a MacBook Air esp. testing its trackpad control and it seems to work exactly the way I'd expect to. I believe it's exactly the way scrolling on a fullpage website, including more content on a single section than it can fit, should behave: not scroll over that content at the bottom of a section, but stop there and require another, separate scroll attempt (detected but a short amount of time without any scroll events recognized) to move on to the next section.
The value of 750ms is for sure something open for debate and fine tuning. I also tried with much lower values like 250ms and it still works very well, maybe even better…? So maybe, with a lower value we can still reach the purpose to stop over-scrolling scrollable section content but still serve visitors well who want to quickly jump to the next section.
Note: this modification does not influence scrolling behavior of sections without scrollable content inside them. So in conclusion, if one does not have scrollable sections, this should change nothing in user experience. On the other hand, if one uses scrollable sections, user experience dramatically improves, at least from my point of view, as users cannot easily over scroll any content they wanted to go to and read.
I will do some more testing with the separate Apple Magic Trackpad and the Magic Mouse as well as trackpads on some other Mac models from friends and family and will come back with results, if you're interested. :)

I tested this on my iPad, and the scrolling works but the kinetic effect is no longer there, meaning as soon as a lift my finger, the scrolling on the portions that should be scrolled stops. This is a bit counterintuitive, since most of the users usualy ""flick"" on tablets and expect the page to continue with that inertia, so that part is a bummer...

But that might have nothing to do with your code, since I think I noticed this as well when testing stuff before on my version as well...

Indeed, I believe the lack of inertia is because the Slimscroll.js framework being used here doesn't support it at all. So, please correct me if wrong, but I think the lack of inertia when scrolling within a section should also be present in the original examples provided with the fullpage.js project.

There even is an issue thread here discussing if it's possible to use iScroll instead of slimscroll framework to improve the way scrolling looks and feels: #623

Not sure about Android, but I think it goes the same way. So maybe a solution would be to check if there's 'movement' on the scrolling (swipe), say check for X milliseconds if the scrollTop changes. If it doesn't change then we reached the end of that DIV with overflow and now we call the method to advance to the next slide (up or down).

I started from @Canubiz's idea. This method stops the scrolling for 250ms once you hit the bottom of the div for the 1st time, resets the variable and you can scroll on the next time.
",reddo,Canubiz
941,2016-10-04 12:30:04,"@reddo try scrolling fast, then waiting 250 milliseconds (just a bit) and then try scrolling fast again. 
The scrolling inertia should should keep firing scrolling events for more than 250 milliseconds and, if the inertial scrolling is accelerating (this is an improvement since the topic was opened), then you should be stuck in the section until the inertia stops.
",alvarotrigo,reddo
941,2016-10-04 12:32:02,"@reddo by the way, shouldn't you be clearing your timeout? Otherwise what you are getting is just a delayed scrolling, but that will take place even after the smallest scrolling, like it happens now.

@alvarotrigo It really is working good, even using my trackpad (MacBook Pro Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015; with latest OsX and Chrome). 

I don't clear the timeout because I want the page to scroll to the next section if the user keeps scrolling. I'm not saying this is the best solution, but I just wanted to share in case I can help someone else.

941,2016-10-26 13:41:59,"@db-24  I haven't tested it myself. So I can not say much. But I do not see any `clearTimeout`, which means the timeout will always get fired no matter what the action of the user is. As it will always enter in the timeout the 1st time it reaches the top or the bottom.

My guess is, kinetic scrolling will keep firing mousewheel events that will kept being caught by the `scrolling` function (unless they are of less intensity the the previous ones average) and therefore this gist will only cause a 500 milliseconds delay, but will keep scrolling up or down when reaching the top or bottom with a single swipe in a Mac trackpad (or similar) 

To test it. I suggest a **fast** but single swipe in the trackpad / magic mouse when you are about to reach the end of the scrollable section.

What I'm trying to say, is that once you enter responsive mode, you don't need the 100% height sections. And if maybe you do, the best workaround would be an option like _responsiveHeight_.

And yep, the responsive: true is not exact. I don't know why. I'm using latest Chrome and the plugin never uses the same 959px value to enter responsive mode and to get out. Should I open a new issue with this?

Note that fullPage.js adds the class `fp-responsive` to the `body` when the site becomes responsive. I would make use of that in your CSS instead of media queries. That way both will match.

Many of those ""problems"" are not problems but questions regarding external knowledge rather than usage of fullPage.js and its functions.

I pointed out the way to do it. By using the callbacks fullPage.js provides you can achieve many things, but I can not code examples for everybody as that's about jQuery or javascript knowledge and I'm not here as a teacher, but as a way to keep improving the plugin and solve issues directly related with it.

I usually reefer people to stackoverflow.com because its a place in which you will find answers to your questions by people who knows about those languages.

840,2014-11-14 12:08:05,"Hi @sandrodz, 

I would say that you shouldn't be initializing fullPage.js unless you want to use it.
Also, if you have any `.section` element the plugin might modify its style and so on...

Fullpage was designed to work as a page layout and nothing outside fullpage.js was expected.

**I would easily solve your problem by checking whether or not there's a `fullpage` element in the current DOM structure:**



But I guess you have a point, I will think about that. 
Meanwhile, if you want to solve your problem in another way, you could change this:



For this:



And you can also change the `removeMouseWheelHandler` function in the same way.
Then, `removeMouseWheelHandler` and `removeTouchHandler` in a similar way:

Change `document` for `container.get(0).` and `$(document)` for `container`. 

You can also apply it to the `keydown` event if you want. 

But again, a proper design shouldn't be initializating fullPage.js when there's no need for it.                       
",alvarotrigo,sandrodz

Pull requests are reviewed and commented before being commited.

Some of your changes don't make sense in fullpage.js.
For example, you removed the jQuery fadeIn from the navigation tooltips and you changed it for a CSS3 transition. But you didn't take into account that this plugin provides compatibility with IE 8 and [transitions are not working there](http://caniuse.com/#search=transition)...
",alvarotrigo,jackmu95
820,2014-11-12 11:09:48,"@alvarotrigo I know that it wasn't the best way to make 'so much' changes at one time and I know that you try to make this as much IE8 compatible as possible but [W3C recommends using HTML5](http://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/4167) and IE8 is simply not fully compatible with HTML5 at all... 

What I mean with that is that IMHO the focus should always be to get the best performance and also usability (for visitors and developers) for modern browsers and only make a website generally working on older browsers like IE8. When someone uses browsers like that he is self responsible that he doesn't get some nice transitions for the tooltips. I believe the most people notice the (0.2s) transition at all.

The problems that I see behind the current tooltip implementation are:
    - The tooltips are created on the 'mouseenter' and removed on the 'mouseleave' event of the menu item which is in terms of performance not that efficient and makes them impossible to debug with a developer console  
    - The content of the tooltips has to be stored in the data of the corresponding menu item
    - The showing/hiding depends on jQuery

All this points are improved in my pull request and you just close it...
Even if IE8 support is a must-have, it would be possible with some quite simple fallback code.

819,2014-11-08 14:11:59,"Thanks for answering @alvarotrigo.

That would be a good way to handle it, and possibly and I will be doing.

The suggested solution won't work because the iframe is cross-origin. Here's what Chrome says:

Sure. Feel free to create a PR for it.

The problem is that you are using `verticalCentered` but you are not creating the required structure for it in your new content. Fullpage.js uses `fp-tableCell` elements and it is expecting them in every section. But it seems you remove it somehow.

And about lower-camel case issue - I'm pretty sure bower packages should stick to lowercase, so it is possible to unregister camelCased package, tho it would break support for people who already installed it, even if its not hard to update bower.json for lowercase. Guess its up to you, prolly it should be left the way it is now untill version 3, where you could possibly make new repo.

",alvarotrigo,monolux
628,2016-03-24 15:40:14,"@alvarotrigo Thank you! If you are interested why I find this good here is the use case I am trying to get working and I think I am nearly finished.

I have a fixed top div that is the navigation, a navbar. This navbar uses flowType to have the nabar menu links change font size according to viewport width and height. Naturally each of the menu items is a div (with the menu link inside) and these divs change height according to the font size of the menu link. This leads to the entire navbar changing height dynamically.

[Here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35584337/fullpagejs-fixed-header-z-index-hides-sections-content) I have found a similar question but see now that just dynamically adding a padding-top value to the `fp-tableCell` class like outlined does not always work.

Instead I think I will either try to add this dynamically changing padding-top value from the changing navbar's height to each of the sections so that the fixed navbar does not hide part of the section content or I will simply add a buffer/placeholder div with the height of the current navbar height to the top of each section, again to not have section content hidden by the navbar.

This I guess would have to be done with `afterRender` and `afterResize`, while having `scrollOverflow:true`, as, especially on PDAs things get wonky. Testing a few things and might make a fiddle with the solution.

Unfortunately `fixedElements:'#navbar'` removes the navbar from the entire site, so I am not exactly sure how to use or work with that just jet, but I am digging.

Related: slimscrollJS has quite static/slow scrolling on PDAs I discovered, will have to see how to tune slimsscrollJS settings to resemble the scrolling more like on a native device.

If you'd like to allow looping from the last slide to the first but prevent looping from the first to the last slide,
you can also 
1) set the loopHorizontal option to true,
2) set the default CSS for the left arrow to display none: 



3) add an afterSlideLoad callback to show and hide the arrow as appropriate:

I'd suggest to leave it in .gitignore (although others add their bower dependencies into the repo - this is because some library maintainers are lazy sometimes and change already published modules [like it happened with jQuery!]). 

Nonetheless - it is useful if you are thinking about adding tests and/or let a ci-server build your script.

As I said, the customization you are talking about is not that simple and less if you want to make it compatible with phone devices. 
Also, what would happen on scroll outside the wrapper? Should the plugin scroll or not? It changes many things...

so maybe we should leave the 500ms delay in there?

Ultimately I think this is going to be _extremely_ difficult to get right
on every device given that tablets have variable CPU/RAM speeds and tablet
browsers (especially chrome) are attempting to behave more and more like
desktop browsers instead of a ""mobile"" browser (since newer devices are
just as powerful as some desktops).

Like Johnathon said, I think 500ms is a good compromise. Developers can
also find this ticket and adjust the waiting period if their application
has specific device requirements.

Sure it's a Chrome bug. And it's been there for quite some time without indication it'll get fixed any time soon. Meanwhile it's one of the most used browsers. I'd still prefer to have the control; I'd pick translate over jquery.animate() any day. Also that'd enable me to trigger GPU acceleration for specific sections as I see fit, either by calling translateZ(0) or translate3d() both of which should work.

Using jQuery as the fallback if ""all else fails"" is a good enough fallback and it should remain as such.

Its `height` is set on load. Just when the plugin creates the needed structure to work with.

This way, of course, the more padding you apply the less space you will have to place your content and it will be more probably to get hidden in some resolutions.

86,2013-11-19 10:46:48,"Hi @michalcik ,

1 - You can use the option `autoScrolling` setting it to `false` and you will have a free scrolling site with the same functionality.

2 - In this plugin, each section will have the size of your window by default but, of course, you can make it bigger if you are using `autoScrolling:false`. In case you wanted to use big texts by using `autoScrolling:true`, then you could use the option `scrollOverflow:true` which would generate an scrolling bar for those sections with a bigger content than the window's height.

3- I'm not familiar with paralax, but you shouldn't have any problem. You should just initialize the paralax plugin inside the callback `afterRender` as specified [at the documentation](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#afterrender). 

> This is the callback you want to use to initialize other plugins or fire any code which requires the document to be ready (as this plugin modifies the DOM to create the resulting structure).

I know you can set autoScrolling to another value in certain conditions like this: <code>$.fn.fullpage.setAutoScrolling(false);</code>

82,2013-11-23 20:34:56,"@alvarotrigo I get it now, you've added a swipe gesture for horizontal slides (might consider swipe trackpad/magic mouse to go along with that feature)

What i'm trying to achieve is a bit unconventional. vertical swipes/mouse wheel snaps and horizontal drag/swipe is a horizontal free scroll (no snap).
You can see it illustrated in this demo i made with onepagescroll.js and nicescroll.js http://chrisriesner.com/cnyn-webzine-experiments/snap-scroll-ONEPAGESCROLL-NICESCROLL-cnyn/snap-scroll-ONEPAGESCROLL-NICE-clean.html
but the problem is that on trackpad horizontal swipes the page snap is triggered vertically.

I wasn't able to see how it worked with fullpage.js because i was having trouble getting external plugins like nicescroll.js to work with fullpage.js even with adding a afterRender: function

`setAutoScrolling` is called automatically by the script one first time. Then, if you are calling it again on `afterLoad`, it should be the 2nd call.

The 3rd call seems to be on your `setTimeout`. I don't know why are you using `if $.fn.fullpage.setAutoScrolling?` as that function won't return anything and will always be false...

About the first point you mention, if you change the 500 value to 100, problems arise if you resize the window slowly or doing small stops. Then it calls the resize function is called multiple times and the movement of the sections/slides become much more slower producing an even worst result. 
I will take a deeper look. I believe the solution might be using percentages instead of pixels and absolute positioned sections instead of relative ones. This of course, is a big change in the plugin structure and I would need to see it is convenient. 

In relation to your second point, I'm not sure to understand what's the problem. Could you add a [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.com/) for it?

I did have bootstrap as a dependancy and adding one of the fullpage options

In my use case, only the homepage is ""full-paged-scrolled"", each section on the homepage represents one post/article (which itself is a share-able URI). But the homepage only shows 7-Recent featured articles.

If the URI to an article which was featured in past is received, but not currently featured, I want some mechanism to be able to redirect it to the proper location rather than confusing the user by showing him the homepage only.

As for committing to the last version: If you have a better strategy planned for managing anchors, you can simply ignore this one, else let me know if you plan to merge, I'll put in another pull request.

30,2013-10-11 09:45:27,"@ekianjo which criteria will you follow to resize the images? 
How can I know which size the user want to see the image in an small screen device? Should I resize it depending on the `height` or on the `width` of the screen? 

I believe it is belong the plugin as this should be done with CSS queries and generating different image sizes for each of the defined resolution the designer wants to play with.

The problem with the given example and the iPad images is already there on desktop computers. It has nothing to do with tablets or mobile devices. The way I designed the demo page is not ready to deal with windows smaller than `720px`. It was a design decision as any other which designers take when they create any site.

I could have solved it with CSS queries and it would have worked as expected on the tablet devices as well.

This plugin works with a full-screen page, if the content is larger than your screen height, then you might have troubles :) That´s why by default the `resize` option is enabled, which helps to reduce the text size in an attempt to avoid this kind of situations. But of course, this won´t solve the case of having big texts as you mention.

The scrolling solution that you suggest is not that trivial. The only way would be allowing the normal scroll behavior of the site, which is either trivial (as the menu is related with it as well as the anchor links), but I will try to work on this last solution.

It sounds to me like you are changing the scrolling speed to a very fast one.
You can look for other plugins, but **none will solve you the problem in a proper way**. As much as they can do is forcing a delay of around 700 milliseconds to 1 second when you arrive to the section. That's how fullPage.js was working before and [many people complained](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=scrolldelay) about that compulsory delay, so I improved fullPage.js to work more intelligently.

in [here](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/941#issuecomment-272885647), @bogdan-r test it works great with MacBook trackpad.

The usage with fullPage's option, like `scrollOverflowEndPrevent: { delay: 500, reversal: false }`


The scroll-end-prevent function works in the situation: when scroll bar is not reached the page end (top or bottom) named status (1), if the scroll bar is reached the page end (top or bottom) named status (2), 

when status (1) => (2), the scroll-end-prevent will work, it will prevent section-move, if status (1) => (2) plus the mousewheel is not terminate, it will trigger the section-move when the time greater than or equal to the delay, which time is started when status becomed (2), 
but if delay setted with 0, it will trigger section-move when status (1) to (2). 
if the scroll bar is in status (2), it meaning the scroll bar is reached the page end (top or bottom), when mousewheel happend it like the status (2) => (2), well this would trigger section-move.

the option `scrollOverflowEndPrevent` has two attributes named `delay` and `reversal`, `delay`(unit:ms) used to set delay time for section-move with the incessancy mousewheel when scroll bar reached the page end (top or bottom) likes status (1) => (2)
You can also set the value with your fact. if you set it `-1`, it meaning always prevent section-move when scroll bar reached the page end (top or bottom) when status (1) => (2). 
the default value is 0, it likes the same effects with fullpage before.

the `reversal`(boolean) attribute is set to switch the situation like this: when scroll bar is in status (2), and the mousewheel dirction let it leave the page end plus change the mousewheel dirction let it reached the page end again without mousewheel terminate, 
like status (2) => (1) => (2), when `reversal` is false, it will prevent section-move, when `reversal` is true, it will trigger section-move.
the default value is true.",lanbomo,bogdan-r

Now, an old issue we still have: the inner scroll doesn't wait enough (doesn't snap) and it scrolls to the next section too quickly so you can't read the current section. In the past I was using a small trick suggested by @Canubiz [here](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/941) but hoped we might solve this somehow with iScroll.

Code like bellow:[https://jsfiddle.net/fiddleoutout/9z4yn9hb/12/](url)

I defined four seconds to change slide,but it's not working when leave it and then back,it seems turn more faster. Like one second change one slide.

@alvarotrigo
",Kennersky,alvarotrigo
1859,2016-02-28 17:19:39,"When you open a site directly in a section (as specified in the URL, e.g. #4thpage) then Fullpage scrolls to that section once the site is loaded.

It waits until everything is loaded, including all elements and startup scripts, and then it scrolls to the right section.

You can see this for example if you open a Fullpage site like this:
http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#4thpage
As requested in the URL it needs to open in the fourth section (scroll to that section on site open).

But when there is a delaying startup script in your document, you might want Fullpage to firstly scroll to the right section and then finish loading of the delaying script (such as a chat box that is starting up).

For example in my case I have a chat box which is just an extra support feature to help people who have trouble on the site or who want to ask a question about what they see on the site. In that case it's more important that all main parts of the site are loaded and Fullpage has scrolled to the right section. After that I would like to startup my chat box script.

If you could add a feature to specify a script or element so that Fullpage will not wait for it on startup, and scrolls to the section directly, that would be much appreciated. On that way these scripts or elements are not delaying the page anymore.

As the maker of Fullpage.js (@alvarotrigo) explained [on another place](http://stackoverflow.com/a/35653296/1081396):

> Probably what's taking time is the loading of the JS, CSS or SWF files required for that script to run. Fullpage.js waits until all elements from the site have loaded to scroll to the section. The reason to do this is due to the use of images in section when using scrollOverflow:true, as fullpage.js needs to determine if the section needs scroll bar or not depending on the size of the loaded image.

Sorry but I prefer to keep providing support for them. I haven't researched much about `vh` and `vm` but it seems it is not very consistent as @tezro  said:

> vw/vh and of course vmax is inconsistent depending on the browser and the OS.

Using pixels instead won't create any real performance problem in your site. The difference will be negligible... They are only recalculated on window resize every 350 milliseconds, which is not a bad delay. 
Using other measures can lead to problems with other options such as `scrollOverflow`. 

If you are so worry about performance, you'd better use [the pure javascript fullpage.js version](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/tree/master/pure%20javascript%20%28Alpha%29). It is still under development, as I have no much time for it, but be sure it will be much faster than the jQuery version. (plus it is not using pixels as it doesn't work with `scrollOverflow`).

That's after I pointed out that I see not benefit at all in using velocity for fullpage.js or even for pagepiling.js. The performance is slower and therefore it won't be integrated.

If you prefer not to use jQuery, you can start to play with the [pure Javascript Alpha version of fullpage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/tree/master/pure%20javascript%20%28Alpha%29).

Now, you can choose where to put it since version 2.

The reason I usually put it in the header is because I consider fullPage.js is necessary for a proper visualization of the site. Take off fullPage.js and any content loaded in the screen will be looking out of place and giving an ugly view of your site until the plugin is called.
Other plugins might be unnecessary or totally independent from the visualization of the data, and that's why it makes sense in those cases.

236,2014-02-12 12:20:17,"Thanks for the new addition of being able to ""jump"" without animating to the anchor in the URL when the page is loaded, I am finding a few issues and a couple of inconsistencies.

In Firefox if I have multiple sections with sub scenes in my page and try to directly go to the 2nd sub scene in the 2nd section it ""jumps"" straight there (no animation) which is great. If I try to do the same but in say the 3rd section and going to the 2nd sub scene it jumps to the first scene in the 3rd section and then animates across...

In other browsers IE/Chrome it always jumps to the first scene in the section and then animates across, is this the expected behaviour or would it be expected to jump directly (no scroll - preferred)

I am looking into the code to try work out a fix, any help @alvarotrigo would be grealy appreciated.

We are using this plugin, it's great! One of the requirements our customer has is to not scroll down to the initial section / slide on page load, so it would just ""jump"" straight to that section/slide and scroll as normal when they continued navigating..

I wouldn't recommend it to you form the UX point of view, but if you still want to do it, I would create a public function inside the plugin with this content. Something like:



And then, i would convert the current addScrollEvent to a public one:   $.fn.fullpage.addScrollEvent = function () { so you can call it from outside the plugin as you call any other method.

Then you would just need to call this new two methods whenever you want.

The reason we are running into this issue is that on slides with longer content when you get to the bottom it automatically scrolls to the next section once you get to the bottom of the content. (For example: http://trouve.thinkatmosphere.com/#blog).

Is there a better work around for this?
