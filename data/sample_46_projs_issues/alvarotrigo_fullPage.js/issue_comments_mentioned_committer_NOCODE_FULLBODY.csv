Also, I guess it would be better to make it optional.

Still wondering if there's a way to disable or hide the URL hash changes...?

I'll just add a summary of my solution...  (and here is the page, if anyone is interested in seeing:  http://www.coffeerepublic.com.au/products/cafina/  -  just click on any of the ""Enquire"" buttons to see the anchor working)

Basically, I needed to go through the loop of my ""product detail"" sections that appear above the ""Enquiry"" form section.  While the loop is going, I needed to add an incrementing ""data-anchor"" property to each section.  Once that was incrementing and adding a ""data-anchor=""product-detail-x"" to each one, then I could effectively link to the ""enquiry"" section (data-anchor=""enquiry"").  There was no need for an array of anchors in the ""anchors"" property of the fullpage.js function.

So then because of my floating sticky header, (and the fact that fullpage.js wants to scroll so that the bottom of the anchored section hits the bottom of the viewport) - I needed to add a custom function in the ""afterLoad"" callback:



The enquire section needed a unique ID different than the (data-anchor=""enquiry"") on that section in order for me to run a scrollTop on it.
Also, ""headerHeight"" is obviously a variable that is set higher up - which basically takes a reading on how tall the header is.

I don't know if that will help anyone, but that's what I had to do to get it to work.

I think it would be better from a user experience point of view to have the controls for scrolling the sections up or down **not** to scroll with the sections.

Meaning the controls should stay fixed at the top or bottom, left or right, while the section changes.

I was trying to do just that and use a fixed element for navigation while not hiding content under that fixed element that is taken from the document flow through its fixed property. So I have come up with [a solution](https://jsfiddle.net/gvsasrnw/), though it is just a draft really, nothing more, you could surly improve on it.

1660,2015-11-20 16:36:15,"Hey @alvarotrigo, the reason you see the scrollbar come up is because you are swiping up rather quickly (we've done this test multiple times). If you scroll up slowly, then you will see that it stays disappeared. Us developers have gotten used to just rolling through things, ha!

If you scroll down a little, then scroll up slowly, say if a user is reading or is trying to see details of something, OR if they scroll down a bit and notice they don't like the content and scroll back up then the bar will stay hidden.

I recommend we also implement a check when the user switches between slides to verify the fp-section is the same as the innerHeight. As of now, we've manually added this into the afterLoad callback. This should be baked into the plugin. I'll add it into the develop pull request. Apologies on adding it to master here, first time doing a pull request :) Will update in an hour or two.

Although, not sure why you made that many changes in the CSS file. It seems like you changed the order. Why? Oh, and the indentation as well. 

I saw you also changed the absolute links to relative ones in the documentation such as this one:



Could you revert those changes as well? Keeping them absolute helps in case some sites copy the readme content into theirs or even for sites such as [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fullpage.js) which extracts the docs from github. I prefer them to always link to the github docs.

1522,2015-09-21 07:51:17,"@kaiserhase How are you loading content into your app? Are the slides initializing with ng-repeat? I [made an angular directive](https://github.com/hellsan631/angular-fullpage.js) that might interest you, and should cover most basic support for using fullpage with angular. I've been able to solve some issues, but the one I have trouble with is dynamic DOM changes and how to react to them.

Angular can dynamically change the DOM based on what ever events the developer wants. In order to react to these changes, I currently have to [destroy and re-initialize](https://github.com/hellsan631/angular-fullpage.js/blob/master/angular-fullpage.js#L25) the entire plugin. I've looked at the docs for `$.fn.fullpage.reBuild()` and I would imagine this might work, but I haven't had any luck with it actually updating the DOM structure. 

Example: I want to bind a click event to a button that adds a slide dynamically on page. In order for fullPage.js to recognize that this new slide (added to the DOM after a click event) exists, my thoughts are that I should be calling `$.fn.fullpage.reBuild()` instead of `destroy('all')`, correct?

Yet when I do this, nothing happens. Currently, I am using a work around that tracks the current page/slide and after a destroy/build cycle, it will move to the last page/slide, but this takes up several plugin functions and the animations still happen (even though i'm using a silent move-to for some reason). 

An example of this can be [found here](http://hellsan631.github.io/angular-fullpage.js/), under second slide.

Any insights into this, @alvarotrigo?

I needed stop scrolling the sections at 60px from the top, but changing the css to do that also affects the bottom, overflowing in 60px because the wrapper has 100% of the viewport.

So I change the code adding the ""offset"" option with value 0 by default.

Then I change this:
 var windowsHeight = $window.height();

To this:
 var windowsHeight = $window.height() - options.offset;

and in the function ""init()"" I added:
if (options.offset) {
    container.css(""top"", options.offset);
    container.height(container.height() - options.offset);

This solved my needs.

I love your script, and used it for my website. with pagepiling.js, but since it doesn't support for the mobile to scroll on long section i was looking for a solution. and then, now I found this fullpage.js that has the scrollable feature working perfectly.

In jsfiddle, I structured by referring all your tips and trick from fullpage and stackoverflow. But in first section, I supposed when scroll down to next section, should wait the fancybox popup finished the effects but it just directly go to next slide while the effects is still running. Plus when I try on localhost version, everything is not like what I did in jsfiddle. Can you show the tricks for this one. Thanks.

941,2015-05-18 03:37:15,"@elahmo @alvarotrigo – I added some additional checks to the scrolling() function in my local version of fullpage.js to solve this issue in a project I am working on right now. Basically I am requiring users of my website to first scroll down to the bottom of a scrollable section, then stop there and wait for 750ms before scrolling again to move on to next section. Up until now, this seems like the most natural and intuitive behavior of visitors who want to read content at the bottom of a section. If you're interested, here is my modified scrolling() function (see //EXTRA CHECK… comments for my additions):



What do you think? Does this also work for you? Is this a change that could make it into the next release of fullpage.js?
",Canubiz,alvarotrigo
941,2015-05-18 15:24:47,"@alvarotrigo Thanks for your feedback. I developed this modification on a MacBook Air esp. testing its trackpad control and it seems to work exactly the way I'd expect to. I believe it's exactly the way scrolling on a fullpage website, including more content on a single section than it can fit, should behave: not scroll over that content at the bottom of a section, but stop there and require another, separate scroll attempt (detected but a short amount of time without any scroll events recognized) to move on to the next section.
The value of 750ms is for sure something open for debate and fine tuning. I also tried with much lower values like 250ms and it still works very well, maybe even better…? So maybe, with a lower value we can still reach the purpose to stop over-scrolling scrollable section content but still serve visitors well who want to quickly jump to the next section.
Note: this modification does not influence scrolling behavior of sections without scrollable content inside them. So in conclusion, if one does not have scrollable sections, this should change nothing in user experience. On the other hand, if one uses scrollable sections, user experience dramatically improves, at least from my point of view, as users cannot easily over scroll any content they wanted to go to and read.
I will do some more testing with the separate Apple Magic Trackpad and the Magic Mouse as well as trackpads on some other Mac models from friends and family and will come back with results, if you're interested. :)
",Canubiz,alvarotrigo
941,2015-06-04 00:05:20,"@Canubiz yes, my bad, I was talking about 'overflow: auto', in fact your example is exactly what I meant. I believe mobile devices do use the 'momentum' with the CSS mentioned, and I know for sure that Windows Phone 8 uses that (along with iOS and the -webkit- prefix).

Not sure about Android, but I think it goes the same way. So maybe a solution would be to check if there's 'movement' on the scrolling (swipe), say check for X milliseconds if the scrollTop changes. If it doesn't change then we reached the end of that DIV with overflow and now we call the method to advance to the next slide (up or down).

@alvarotrigo I did use iScroll on some projects and it behaves bad on some Windows Phones, so I had to change my mind about presenting cool scrollbars to the user OR presenting them a better scrolling experience. Turns out I had to switch off iScroll on this case and only use it on other devices. As for the scrolling itself, it worked without problems with just the 'overflow:auto' CSS for the Windows phones.

In my opinion, the user, on a mobile device, rarely, and I mean RARELY uses scrollbars to navigate up and down / left and right on web pages and/or apps. The scrollbars don't even show up on some devices, so why should I bother? :)

`.fp-tableCell { height: 100% !important; }`

Had to do the same. Setting responsive to 959px enables normal scrolling but it does not prevent the plugin from giving the sections a 100%.

I hate using !important. Would be nice to avoid it.

Also, I set `'responsive': 959` and for some reason it's not an exact value... That's kind of concerning when using CSS media queries, that are super precise.

Anyways, hope this two issues have a solution or that you can help me find one.

I actually understand why you didn't get me... I didn't use this: `.fp-tableCell { height: 100% !important; }`, I used this: `.fp-tableCell { height: auto !important; }`

What I'm trying to say, is that once you enter responsive mode, you don't need the 100% height sections. And if maybe you do, the best workaround would be an option like _responsiveHeight_.

And yep, the responsive: true is not exact. I don't know why. I'm using latest Chrome and the plugin never uses the same 959px value to enter responsive mode and to get out. Should I open a new issue with this?

Pull requests are reviewed and commented before being commited.

Some of your changes don't make sense in fullpage.js.
For example, you removed the jQuery fadeIn from the navigation tooltips and you changed it for a CSS3 transition. But you didn't take into account that this plugin provides compatibility with IE 8 and [transitions are not working there](http://caniuse.com/#search=transition)...
",alvarotrigo,jackmu95
820,2014-11-12 11:09:48,"@alvarotrigo I know that it wasn't the best way to make 'so much' changes at one time and I know that you try to make this as much IE8 compatible as possible but [W3C recommends using HTML5](http://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/4167) and IE8 is simply not fully compatible with HTML5 at all... 

What I mean with that is that IMHO the focus should always be to get the best performance and also usability (for visitors and developers) for modern browsers and only make a website generally working on older browsers like IE8. When someone uses browsers like that he is self responsible that he doesn't get some nice transitions for the tooltips. I believe the most people notice the (0.2s) transition at all.

The problems that I see behind the current tooltip implementation are:
    - The tooltips are created on the 'mouseenter' and removed on the 'mouseleave' event of the menu item which is in terms of performance not that efficient and makes them impossible to debug with a developer console  
    - The content of the tooltips has to be stored in the data of the corresponding menu item
    - The showing/hiding depends on jQuery

All this points are improved in my pull request and you just close it...
Even if IE8 support is a must-have, it would be possible with some quite simple fallback code.

> It seems like a problem in Firefox with the mousewheel event as you can see here.

The suggested solution won't work because the iframe is cross-origin. Here's what Chrome says:

> Blocked a frame with origin ""http://localhost:3000"" from accessing a frame with origin ""http://player.vimeo.com"". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.

> A workaround, kind of like a hack, would be to cover all the video except the center (because of the play button) with an invisible layer.

I've already implemented the hole-in-the-center workaround, but it's hacky as hell. :(

> Or cover it all and autoplay the video.

It is impossible to autoplay videos on mobile:

And about lower-camel case issue - I'm pretty sure bower packages should stick to lowercase, so it is possible to unregister camelCased package, tho it would break support for people who already installed it, even if its not hard to update bower.json for lowercase.

628,2016-03-24 15:40:14,"@alvarotrigo Thank you! If you are interested why I find this good here is the use case I am trying to get working and I think I am nearly finished.

I have a fixed top div that is the navigation, a navbar. This navbar uses flowType to have the nabar menu links change font size according to viewport width and height. Naturally each of the menu items is a div (with the menu link inside) and these divs change height according to the font size of the menu link. This leads to the entire navbar changing height dynamically.

[Here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35584337/fullpagejs-fixed-header-z-index-hides-sections-content) I have found a similar question but see now that just dynamically adding a padding-top value to the `fp-tableCell` class like outlined does not always work.

Instead I think I will either try to add this dynamically changing padding-top value from the changing navbar's height to each of the sections so that the fixed navbar does not hide part of the section content or I will simply add a buffer/placeholder div with the height of the current navbar height to the top of each section, again to not have section content hidden by the navbar.

This I guess would have to be done with `afterRender` and `afterResize`, while having `scrollOverflow:true`, as, especially on PDAs things get wonky. Testing a few things and might make a fiddle with the solution.

Unfortunately `fixedElements:'#navbar'` removes the navbar from the entire site, so I am not exactly sure how to use or work with that just jet, but I am digging.

Related: slimscrollJS has quite static/slow scrolling on PDAs I discovered, will have to see how to tune slimsscrollJS settings to resemble the scrolling more like on a native device.

Also I hope my question falls within the scope of this topic enough in order for me to not start another discussion thread. Currently I'm using jQuery to dynamically add/delete sections to my site as it is resized and have used the above mentioned method: destroying FullPage, emptying the content of my div, adding some new content, and then reinitializing FullPage. This all works brilliantly except my one problem with what @alexcroox mentions above is that whenever the function is called (upon a resize) it brings me back to the first page/section. Any tips/advice on how to avoid this? I can throw everything into a codepen if you'd like. Hoping it's a simple fix though. Thanks in advance for any help on the problem!

Many people is requesting this feature, but **unless somebody take a look at the code by their own I believe it will still unfixed.**
Make some tests in your devices if you want to help me with it.

The problem seems to be in the [`reBuild` function](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/jquery.fullPage.js#L1041), it seems the `height` and `width` of the screen is not restrieved correctly.

Just add something like this after `windowsHeight = $(window).height();`



Like so:



That will show you on the top left corner of your site the `height` and `width` values for your screen. Take a look at them and see if they make sense for you when rotating the device.

**Update**: Logging the width and height of the window on a Nexus 7 and they appear reversed in the `reBuild` function. Surely someone else recognized this and has a polyfill or something...

**Update**: Changing the `reBuild` function to fire on only the `resize` event instead of `orientationchange` event fixed this issue on the Nexus 7. There have been [some reports](http://davidwalsh.name/orientation-change#comment-31322) that the `orientationchange` event fires prematurely, which is why the values are reversed. @alvarotrigo any reason we can't just exclusively use the `resize` event?

so maybe we should leave the 500ms delay in there?

Ultimately I think this is going to be _extremely_ difficult to get right
on every device given that tablets have variable CPU/RAM speeds and tablet
browsers (especially chrome) are attempting to behave more and more like
desktop browsers instead of a ""mobile"" browser (since newer devices are
just as powerful as some desktops).

Like Johnathon said, I think 500ms is a good compromise. Developers can
also find this ticket and adjust the waiting period if their application
has specific device requirements.

Everyone -- I just found a couple of great stack overflow answers that discuss this situation in great detail complete with testing:
- http://stackoverflow.com/a/6603537/837042
- http://stackoverflow.com/a/13805104/837042

Going off of the second answer, we should try only listening to the `resize` event and using `window.innerHeight` and `window.innerWidth`.

However, I'm not encouraged that there is a great way to have something that handles every single browser, considering this is in the jQuery documentation for the `.resize()` function:

> Depending on implementation, resize events can be sent continuously as the resizing is in progress (the typical behavior in Internet Explorer and WebKit-based browsers such as Safari and Chrome), or only once at the end of the resize operation (the typical behavior in some other browsers such as Opera).

I'd still prefer to have the control; I'd pick translate over jquery.animate() any day. Also that'd enable me to trigger GPU acceleration for specific sections as I see fit, either by calling translateZ(0) or translate3d() both of which should work.

Using jQuery as the fallback if ""all else fails"" is a good enough fallback and it should remain as such.

It works fine for normal pages, but when you have a MVP structure or something like turbolinks modifying the ""body"" with styles like ""overflow:hidden"" will affect other pages and prevent scrolling in other parts of the application, unless you reload.

82,2013-11-23 20:34:56,"@alvarotrigo I get it now, you've added a swipe gesture for horizontal slides (might consider swipe trackpad/magic mouse to go along with that feature)

What i'm trying to achieve is a bit unconventional. vertical swipes/mouse wheel snaps and horizontal drag/swipe is a horizontal free scroll (no snap).
You can see it illustrated in this demo i made with onepagescroll.js and nicescroll.js http://chrisriesner.com/cnyn-webzine-experiments/snap-scroll-ONEPAGESCROLL-NICESCROLL-cnyn/snap-scroll-ONEPAGESCROLL-NICE-clean.html
but the problem is that on trackpad horizontal swipes the page snap is triggered vertically.

I wasn't able to see how it worked with fullpage.js because i was having trouble getting external plugins like nicescroll.js to work with fullpage.js even with adding a afterRender: function

48,2013-10-24 22:58:28,"Thats awesome @alvarotrigo really good addition to the plugin I think.

The project I am working (after talking to the client) didn't really work
with a fixed header and footer unfortunately and so I had to add the header
and footer into the first and last sections using the slimscroll
functionality for the footer - which in the end doesn't work that bad,
thanks.

I have been working with flexslide in the sections and setting the carousel
height to window height to get a full page background in on each carousel
slide. This would be another great addition to your plugin as you already
have a slider and are setting the window height, but I wanted the carousel
page navigation as well as the directional navigation and a carousel load
function.

I did have bootstrap as a dependancy and adding one of the fullpage options
adds a class called 'table' which conflicts with bootstrap. Might be worth
changing this class name to a more unique class name for future releases
maybe? table-js or fullpage-table.   (just a thought)

Once done I'll send you a link to see what you think.

Thanks again.

31,2013-10-10 13:33:47,"@alvarotrigo 

I am planning to use this thing in production. But I found two issues that were possibly deal breaker. 
- Complex anchoring mechanism
- Ability to redirect when hash not found

My initial thought was to rewrite the portions concerned with anchor mechanism but wisdom (or procrastination? :smiling_imp:  ) prevailed. 

In my use case, only the homepage is ""full-paged-scrolled"", each section on the homepage represents one post/article (which itself is a share-able URI). But the homepage only shows 7-Recent featured articles.

If the URI to an article which was featured in past is received, but not currently featured, I want some mechanism to be able to redirect it to the proper location rather than confusing the user by showing him the homepage only.

As for committing to the last version: If you have a better strategy planned for managing anchors, you can simply ignore this one, else let me know if you plan to merge, I'll put in another pull request.

Note: My website needs to one scroll a page and not show scrollBar. So, I can't be setting like: `scrollBar:true`.

I also found add: `&enablejsapi=1` after video embed but also not success.

Must I add more setting in fullPage.js?

1859,2016-02-28 17:19:39,"When you open a site directly in a section (as specified in the URL, e.g. #4thpage) then Fullpage scrolls to that section once the site is loaded.

It waits until everything is loaded, including all elements and startup scripts, and then it scrolls to the right section.

You can see this for example if you open a Fullpage site like this:
http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#4thpage
As requested in the URL it needs to open in the fourth section (scroll to that section on site open).

But when there is a delaying startup script in your document, you might want Fullpage to firstly scroll to the right section and then finish loading of the delaying script (such as a chat box that is starting up).

For example in my case I have a chat box which is just an extra support feature to help people who have trouble on the site or who want to ask a question about what they see on the site. In that case it's more important that all main parts of the site are loaded and Fullpage has scrolled to the right section. After that I would like to startup my chat box script.

If you could add a feature to specify a script or element so that Fullpage will not wait for it on startup, and scrolls to the section directly, that would be much appreciated. On that way these scripts or elements are not delaying the page anymore.

As the maker of Fullpage.js (@alvarotrigo) explained [on another place](http://stackoverflow.com/a/35653296/1081396):

> Probably what's taking time is the loading of the JS, CSS or SWF files required for that script to run. Fullpage.js waits until all elements from the site have loaded to scroll to the section. The reason to do this is due to the use of images in section when using scrollOverflow:true, as fullpage.js needs to determine if the section needs scroll bar or not depending on the size of the loaded image.

First off - amazing work here! I've used your script numerous times and it always wows the audience.

Anyways, for a particular page that I'm building, I'm using fullpage.js to present 5 slides/sections. Once the 5 slides have been scrolled through, I'd like the rest of the site (let's call it Slide 6) to return to normal scrolling behavior.

236,2014-02-12 12:20:17,"Thanks for the new addition of being able to ""jump"" without animating to the anchor in the URL when the page is loaded, I am finding a few issues and a couple of inconsistencies.

In Firefox if I have multiple sections with sub scenes in my page and try to directly go to the 2nd sub scene in the 2nd section it ""jumps"" straight there (no animation) which is great. If I try to do the same but in say the 3rd section and going to the 2nd sub scene it jumps to the first scene in the 3rd section and then animates across...

In other browsers IE/Chrome it always jumps to the first scene in the section and then animates across, is this the expected behaviour or would it be expected to jump directly (no scroll - preferred)

I wouldn't recommend it to you form the UX point of view, but if you still want to do it, I would create a public function inside the plugin with this content. Something like:



And then, i would convert the current addScrollEvent to a public one:   $.fn.fullpage.addScrollEvent = function () { so you can call it from outside the plugin as you call any other method.

The reason we are running into this issue is that on slides with longer content when you get to the bottom it automatically scrolls to the next section once you get to the bottom of the content. (For example: http://trouve.thinkatmosphere.com/#blog).
