Hi,
Fullpage.js is a nice plugin. I've used it in lots of pages. 
But I faced problem in the below page.

When I use a fixed top nav. The active class not working. 
I assigned the menu properly.
But still no luck. I can't figure it out.

On a few viewport heights, the content stops being vertically aligned in the middle. This happens at 868px. Not at 869px (it jumps back being vertically aligned in the middle) but then it happens again at 870px height. I did not make any adjustments in the core code and didn't apply more CSS classes.

I can only say that this is happening because you are using `scrollOverflow:true` and somehow fullPage.js believes it needs to create an internal scrolling for your slide. 
I can see how it is indeed necessary in [the 3rd slide of the section](http://wespire.nl/klanten/floriaan/djbus/#section/clients) on 1040px width. Avoid that, and you'll probably solve your issue. 

You are probably doing something funny with your CSS styles in the 1st slide and making fullPage.js believe it needs scrollbar. ",alvarotrigo,2017-03-23 13:04:16

I'm rebuilding a website and came across an issue where the slide class conflicts with Flexslider. But I'm hoping the solution might be built in to FullPage.js... On mobile I'm currently using Flexslider to scroll horizontally through a list of images. Then on desktop I simply display them in a row.

Now I've adopted FullPage.js but Flexslider's `slide` class conflicts with FullPage.js' `slide` class. Is there a built in way to have horizontal scrolling limited to mobile only? Then on larger screens I can simply layout each image (slide class) without the horizontal scrolling effect?

### Link 
The second page on [this codepen](http://codepen.io/joe-watkins/pen/rFzcf) shows the horizontal effect I'd like to use on mobile only. But I am not seeing a way to stop it from functioning that way on desktop (or > 1024px)

Perhaps there's an option to change the classname `slide` from being used and I could continue to use Flexslider on mobile?

Currently I'm trying to use Fullpage on a website I'm building. At the moment I've two questions:

First of all, is it possible to disable Fullpage on screens bigger than 640px and enable it on smaller screens than 640px? 

I know about the existence of the `responsiveWidth` option, but this option only allows me to disable Fullpage on screens smaller than the stated value. 

For now I'm using the `setResponsive` method to enable/disable Fullpage. I'm doing this like so:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Only when I use this method the inline styles of Fullpage don't get removed. This means normal scrolling is enabled but the sections still have the height Fullpage gave them. So my question is: is this supposed to be like this or is this a bug?

Thanks in advance!",daviddelusenet,2017-03-15 13:21:02

Use callbacks such as `afterLoad` or `onLeave`. Read more about callbacks [in the docs](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#callbacks).
Or just use something like `$('.section.active)`",alvarotrigo,2017-03-09 11:52:35
2604,2017-03-09 13:28:00,"That's what i ment. It applies to all sections. Not only to the active one. Here is the code i'm using:

				$('.desc').addClass('color');

Like can be seen in the examples at the docs.
Use comething like `if(index === 1)` or `if(anchor === 'mySectionAnchor')`

I startet to search in the code and the problem is the `n = e.find(I).get(0).scrollHeight` in `                r.length ? n = t.scrollHeight(e) : (n = e.get(0).scrollHeight, l.verticalCentered && (n = e.find(I).get(0).scrollHeight));
`

Has anybody an idea how to solve this problem?

I am using fullpage in Wordpress and have successfully created a single homepage with several sections (each with just 1 slide). When i enter a URL that points to a specific section into the address bar in firefox, the page loads and correctly scrolls to the right section. When i use the browser console to enter javascript to cause a scroll event, it also works correctly. However, when i click a link on a page that is intended to scroll to a section, nothing happens. I have tried several different formats of links and none of them do anything. I have tested in firefox and chromium in windows 10 - both are the same, except in chromium one of the links works the first time i click it but then doesn't again.
there are no relevant warnings/errors in the console.

I said ""not at all"" to paste the entire source for jquery into the codepen.

But fullPage.js intialization is not the jQuery library source code .
So, add any fullPage.js related javascript in the jquery panel. Just as in any of the tens of codepen demos of the documentation, such [as this](http://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/eNLBXo).  See how clean is it? I would love to see something like that :)

I'll make it as an enhancement in this case. fullPage.js is an scrolling library, so it is not supposed to be used with speed 0 in any case.

However, I noticed this problem with `autoScrolling: false`. That is why I reported the horizontal problem and not the vertical. I isolated the problem and found it to be the `scrollingSpeed`, but now I realize. [Here](http://codepen.io/waissbluth/pen/PpomBx) you can see the problem I am having exactly, where the vertical skipping is not a problem, just the horizontal.

Touch events will still be detected after you finish your slide in 0 milliseconds and therefore they'll trigger the movement to another slide.

Some people opt to make use of the [Fading Effect extension](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/fading-effect.html), which still having a scrollingSpeed time but replacing the scrolling animation for a fading one.

And others they just get rid of horizontal slides in small screen devices using the [Responsive Sliders](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/responsive-slides.html) extension.

> scrollOverflowOptions: when using scrollOverflow:true fullpage.js will make use of a forked and modified version of [iScroll.js libary](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll/). You can customize the scrolling behaviour by providing fullpage.js with the iScroll.js options you want to use. Check [its documentation](http://iscrolljs.com/) for more info.

Is it possible to remove the anchor from the very first section (and slide), as when we arrive the first time on the page?

For example on this page, delete `#firstPage`:

I stumbled upon a strange behaviour when using the dragandmove extension in combination with an fp-auto-height footer.

If the extension is active and I use the mousewheel to navigate, the page will scroll far below the footer showing blank space (footer is the on top of the viewport).
If I drag down to the footer, the footer is shown as expected, but the navi on the right is showing that I´m not on the footer section (thinks I´m on Page3). If I now drag up, it will scroll over the section before the footer (over Page3 to Page2).

Hi,
i´m creating a fullPage website for a customer. The site is intended to work with the extensions dragandmove and resetSlides in the end. So I included the extension library from the dist-folder instead of the normal one. 

My js in the html-file looks like this:

### Steps to reproduce it
fullPage is working as expected, but if I´m on the last slide of an horizontal row and swipe right/right arrow on keyboard, the script crashes giving a console error: ""TypeError: t is undefined"".
I thought that might be because I didn´t include the extensions in the beginning. 
After my customer got these from your shop I included them, but no change. The script still stops working if I try to slide to the next slide, that doesn´t exist.

The problem disapperas when setting the loopHorizontal option to true, but thats not what the customer wants.

2543,2017-02-03 22:30:40,"Hey there. I am using the offsetSections extension for a project.  I'm essentially making 6 carousels in a row at 85% height.  I have an image overlay on top of each carousel that has a like ""click to view"" button that then reveals the carousel.  It works beautifully on desktop but on actual mobile devices I keep on getting this JS error ""TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 't.position')"".  It doesn't happen all of the time but when it does it prevents any of the carousels from working.

It looks like its happening in this chunk of code in fullpage.extensions.min.js : 
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Settings Im using: 
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I can send you a link to the page I'm working on privately, but its for a client and I cant put a public link here.

### Steps to reproduce it
1. Click into carousel, start swiping
2. Move down to next carousel click into it, JS error throws
3. Carousel is now unclickable/swipeable

Mobile Devices, iOS in particular

Im in a bit of a time crunch, so any help would be much appreciated. If theres any way to just get an un-minified version of extensions so I can add a check for undefined, that could possibly work in my situation.  ",tarasiegel,2017-02-04 14:08:56

Hi There,

First of all, great plugin! 

I'm using the latest version of fullpage.js and i've got a question about the responsive settings.

When using _**responsiveWidth**_ in combination with _**fp-auto-height-responsive**_, the mobile version still has an calculated height at the element (inline style). The sections still have a height of 100%. Next to disableing the plugin, I would also like to remove the calculated height and change it to auto for example.

Is this possible?

When viewing a Fullpage-powered site on an Android device, typing into an input field causes the section sizes to become messed up. It only occurs when you start typing, which drags the input field into view, forcing the page to scroll and break the Fullpage plugin.

Here is an example:

![fullpage_android_keyboard_problem](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7820108/22380500/973bc71a-e4b5-11e6-82b1-9557ad0841f0.jpg)

The problem is worsened if the device is in landscape mode. Often the next slide simply becomes fully visible:

Scrolling the page manually afterwards does not remove the effect; the offset created by this issue persists until the page is reloaded. If setAllowScrolling is false, this prevents page transitions all together, as both the original and newly visible sections will scroll but not initiate a page change.

Invoking $.fn.fullpage.reBuild() resolves the issue sometimes, but only when I call it manually from dev tools. Triggering the function on window resize and orientationchange events does not work.

### Steps to reproduce it
1. Ensure there is a text input on your section.
2. Focus on text input to cause keyboard to appear.
3. Start typing to force the input field into view.
4. Close the keyboard
5. The section should be stuck in a ""scrolled up"" position, partially showing the following slide.

Greetings!
I wanted to place a footer at the bottom of a full page site with auto-height. The footer's height is displayed properly, but if you scroll from the last section to the footer, you don't see anything of the last slide, the footer at the top of the window, and a lot of whitespace below that.

I reviewed many examples about fullPage.js footers and I still can't get it to work the way it does everywhere else. And I have no clue at all where the issue originates from :/

Am I missing something obvious?

### Versions 
Using the newest version of fullPage and jQuery, issue occurs on all browsers I was able to test.

I replied you already [in stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/41869810/1081396).

Your question is related with this [other open issue](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/2494) regarding the mouse wheel callbacks.

As I said in stackoverflow, you might want to try [legargy.js](https://github.com/d4nyll/lethargy) which was build with that single purpose in mind. Then you can deal with the touch events by yourself? 
fullPage.js is a much bigger framework and if you are not planning to use any of its features besides the scroll event, you might find it easier to just go with another solution. 

In case you are planning to use some kind of fading effect, you can also check the [fading extension](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/fading-effect.html).

What it does is basically.. whenever you scroll and reach a certain section.. the map flies to a specific LatLong. 

So I wanted to add fullPage to the scrolling part. The map gets triggered by: window.onscroll = function(). This ofcourse does not work with fullPage. So I added the option scrollBar: true.

And this only works for the first section (to see other sections actually grab the scrollbar and drag down). After that I get this in Chrome console:

I guess a related question would be if that slide address (""/2"" etc.) can be an ID/anchor (i.e. ""#registration"" or something like that) instead of just a number.

And just to confirm, all this requires purchasing the Scroll Horizontally extension, correct?

I'm asking about this behavior because I'm lazy loading heavy image backgrounds with the help of the afterLoad callback. But if the user doesn't enter the page on the first section, the images load anyway because afterLoad always fires on the first section first.

I don't think that's the case. You are just probably seeing the 1st section for a moment as the library needs to apply its css and classes.

Also the image on section 1 which has no `src` only `data-src` for lazy loading will load, if we enter the site directly on `#Section3`. (You can check this in developer tools network tab).

If we set the option `animateAnchor: false` the site will directly load section 3. No blinking no jumping, but `afterLoad` will still trigger on section 1, the active class will be toggled and the image on section 1 loads.

in [here](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/941#issuecomment-269897045) I display a demo and some intro to fix this problem, it use the delay with the user's option to solve it.

in [here](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/941#issuecomment-272885647), @bogdan-r test it works great with MacBook trackpad.

The usage with fullPage's option, like `scrollOverflowEndPrevent: { delay: 500, reversal: false }`


The scroll-end-prevent function works in the situation: when scroll bar is not reached the page end (top or bottom) named status (1), if the scroll bar is reached the page end (top or bottom) named status (2), 

when status (1) => (2), the scroll-end-prevent will work, it will prevent section-move, if status (1) => (2) plus the mousewheel is not terminate, it will trigger the section-move when the time greater than or equal to the delay, which time is started when status becomed (2), 
but if delay setted with 0, it will trigger section-move when status (1) to (2). 
if the scroll bar is in status (2), it meaning the scroll bar is reached the page end (top or bottom), when mousewheel happend it like the status (2) => (2), well this would trigger section-move.

the option `scrollOverflowEndPrevent` has two attributes named `delay` and `reversal`, `delay`(unit:ms) used to set delay time for section-move with the incessancy mousewheel when scroll bar reached the page end (top or bottom) likes status (1) => (2)
You can also set the value with your fact. if you set it `-1`, it meaning always prevent section-move when scroll bar reached the page end (top or bottom) when status (1) => (2). 
the default value is 0, it likes the same effects with fullpage before.

the `reversal`(boolean) attribute is set to switch the situation like this: when scroll bar is in status (2), and the mousewheel dirction let it leave the page end plus change the mousewheel dirction let it reached the page end again without mousewheel terminate, 
like status (2) => (1) => (2), when `reversal` is false, it will prevent section-move, when `reversal` is true, it will trigger section-move.
the default value is true.",lanbomo,

I need help finding the best suited way to properly setup my website using fullPage. 
My current setup is as below:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

### Current problems:
1. White space below forum on second slide since the page/slide height is a lot less than the landing page in bootstrap.
2. iFrame height doesn't always change properly so content sometimes gets cut off. I use javascript to constantly resize the iFrame on content or window changes.
3. scrollOverflow true fixes the white space, but breaks scrolling on the second slide only.

### What to achieve?
My goal is to use fullPage to horizontally switch/slide between both the website and the forum. Content sizes shouldn't matter as scrolling should simply become automatically possible as soon as the content of the page extends the max height of the users' screen. Except it for some reason won't work like that OR I've setup the use of fullPage uncorrectly.

### Questions
1. What settings do I need to pass with the fullPage initalisation?
2. Do I need to add extra CSS options to the body of either parts of the website like fp auto height?
3. Could fullPage work with iFrames at all?
4. What else am I forgetting / doing in a wrong way?

Your help is greatly appreciated.

I believe this is a request for a new feature, or an enhancement, rather than a bug.

If a user skips ahead to a section via an anchor link, and then scrolls back UP to a previous section, I would like to be able to transition directly to the last slide of the section rather than the first.

2. After **Section C, Slide 1** has loaded, scroll up to go to **Section B**

Saw this [website](https://sharp.vn/vn/cong-nghe-long-giat-khong-lo/), and I would like to know the trick how we can achieve this kind of function with `fullpage.js`. Or can you prepare this as one of your extension because it seems like can be useful for everyone in future.

The main thing is, when scroll, animation will trigger until the last scroll of the animation. And when the animation is finished, another scroll will lead to next section. (maybe need to set delay timing on `onleave` function, but I'm not so sure with this one)

From my understanding, it need to concentrate on `scroll` function, but I not master in javascript code.

The option ""dragAndMove"" which does, if I understand correctly, allow users to drag the page up/down to scroll, cannot be disabled using the value False.

### Reproducing
Editing any of the tutorial webpages works to reproduce. For example: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/drag-and-move.html

### Steps to reproduce it
1. Find line in JavaScript: dragAndMove: true,
2. Change to: dragAndMove: false
3. Draging to scroll on the website using my cursor is still possible.

I am trying to disable it (this part of iscroll) as I think it might block the use of #hash anchors. Cannot get ScrollToElement to work either.

I understand it's easier to quickly close issues/questions and be done with it, but a little help would've been great. I spend over 7 hours yesterday trying to disable the scroll locking of fullpage, as I only want to use the full page horizontal sliding.

I then added the extension scrollOverflow and finally scrollOverflow: true worked. But it also added this weird scrolling problem that wouldn't allow the use of anchors once a user scrolled down a page. It was like the top part of the website wouldn't exist anymore or got cut of.

So I have two options; I either get to disable the scroll locking of fullpage OR I get to disable the iscroll feature DragAndMove which seems to be the thing that causes the scroll problems using anchors.

The drag and move extension has nothing todo with `scrollOverflow` and let alone `iScroll` library.

2493,2017-01-09 11:38:16,"Thank you for your reply. I'll try to give a little more context as to what I am trying to accomplish. Hopefully this takes away the confusing part.

1. I have a website and a forum which I both want to have in seperate slides, so I can horizontally slide between them. I've setup the required HTML structures, imported the required CSS and Javascript and I got it to work. But it also broke some other features of my website, so  I went and tried to fix this.

2. The first problem is that as soon as I got fullPage to work it completely disabled any way to scroll down the website. I started to read more about all options and found that ""scrollOverflow: true:"" should solve this but this option wouldn't work without importing scrolloverflow.min.js. 

3. Now the first problem was solved, as I could scroll around the website again but importing scrolloverflow.min.js introduced a new problem. It added lots of extra features of IScroll which I didn't really need, one of them being DragAndMove.

As soon as I scroll down, I am unable to use anchor links to get back to the top of the website. I think this is due to IScroll calculating the new page dimensions after any movement (correct me if I'm wrong). So I now wanted to disable DragAndMove, hopefully with the effect that users could use anchors again.

4. As I read more and more documentation about fullPage and IScroll I found another feature; scrollToElement. This essentially does the same as anchors but it would be built-in with IScroll so as I couldn't disable DragAndMove or the scrolling locks of fullPage I saw this as an acceptable workaround.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to get scrollToElement to work either, as it needs its own initialization of IScroll, which I think is something that is handled by fullPage already? This is were I got confused myself. **This part of the code confused me, because I was already initializing fullPage on my wrapper element (which includes IScroll?).**
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Looking at the examples I should use scrollToElement like this: myScroll.scrollToElement(options here)
But I have no idea what the ""myscroll"" part is on my website since I use fullPage.

5. I hope this clears a bit of the confusing and explains what I am trying to accomplish. I think I am mixing up things, but I am not entirely sure. 

**Conclusion:**
1. I wouldn't need to use scrolloverflow.min.js at all if I had a way to enable regular scrolling while using fullPage to horizontally slide between the two parts of my website.
2. I have a onepage website, so I need a way to get anchors to work. If enabling scrolling with fullPage is not possible, how do I implement scrollToElement as a workaround?

If some things are still unclear, I'll try to explain it even more. Thank you in advance.

Firstly, absolutely love fullPage.js. It is really something special.

However, the sideNav (#fp-nav), which has a z-index of 100 (from jquery.fullPage.css), is appearing above my fullscreen div of z-index 200+. The div is positioned absolutely, and i cannot for the life of me figure out why this is happening. 

If anyone has had this problem before or has an idea of what might be happening, please let me know!

in

you set container's position to 'relative', but it does not work well in IE9. Two sections are fine, however if there were more than 2 sections, no matter how you scroll, it will still stay on section 2.

change it to 'absolute' can fix the problem;

i fixed the problem below as it was a problem with the naming in my theme.

For some reasons i do have to create a full page with several sections that cover in sum the complete height. But i would like to scroll only to the top section.
But if i do the following

section 1 <- scroll to
section 2
section 3
section 4 <- scroll to
section 5
section 6

and so on

i does not work.


Additionally, the padding top does not show any effect. My header header is 100px but when i add

PaddingTop:100px i completely stops working
PaddingTop:100 does nothing

Any ideas?


### Description

My problem is that scrolling does only work for the first to second section.
The sections itself are recognized (#sectioname added to url corretly) and after waiting in that section the section is aligned correctly.
But when scrolling to that section i can scroll freely.

I read before issues, and I found @alvarotrigo was fixed at fullPage.js version 2.9.2.

Note: My website needs to one scroll a page and not show scrollBar. So, I can't be setting like: `scrollBar:true`.

I also found add: `&enablejsapi=1` after video embed but also not success.

Must I add more setting in fullPage.js?

`</div>`
 
I gave the img tag the l-cover-class with the following style:

`img.l-cover {
	display:block;
	width:100vw;
	min-height:100vh;
	min-width:calc(100vh * 3 / 2);
}`

Everything is fine but i want the pictures to center, when the screen gets smaller. right now the pictures stay fix at the left side. 
Can anyone help me?

Thanks

I set the plugin to enter responsive mode at a width of 767px and at this point it seems as though the continuous horizontal sliders return to the default behaviour of looping back to the start.

1. Click on navigational arrows to ensure that the continuous horizontal scroll is working correctly
2. Resize the browser to below 767px wide to initialise responsive mode
3. See that the slides now loop back to the start (right to left) instead of being continuous as they were before

In the fiddle below, I have a `scrollOverflow:true` fullpage.js initialization. For accessibility reasons I need to allow the user to keyboard press the arrows to step through the sections. When using the keyboard, it just ""jumps"" to each section without the ability to scroll through a overflow section of long content.

How can I resolve this issue to have the keyboard presses emulate a scroll action when within a overflow section?

Reinstantiating after using the destroy() method (without the 'all' parameter passed) generates the error `fullPage: Fullpage.js can only be initialized once and you are doing it multiple times!`. So that also appears to be a no go.

I am using fullpage.js on a page of a site i'm building. Everything is working as intended and i've been very happy with the experience thus far. However, i've ran into one small issue which i can't seem to resolve.

I've set the responsiveWidth: 961 so when the screen size is below 961px, the slider feature is disabled. Now when trying to resize the screen (up and down) on the FIRST slide (labelled: properties) past the above mentioned breakpoint, everything is fine.
However when trying to resize the screen when the viewport is on the second (and above) slides, the html structure completely breaks below width 961px.

Now you may say in a real world scenario, no user is going to be playing around with the dev tools and resizing the window. However, when on a tablet (tested on an iPad) and you turn to landscape mode, it triggers this issue. 

Thank you in advance!

### Steps to reproduce it
- After fiddle loads, click once on the result window to give it focus
- Normal flow:
  - Press down arrow once (fullpage will move to next section)
  - Press down arrow again (fullpage will move to next section)
  - Press up again until you are back at the top
- Errorneus flow:
  - At the top, press down arrow multiple times, quickly after each other
  - The intended effect is not achieved
  - Now, make sure you are at slide nr 3 or 4.

When I scroll the page it doesn't do anything.

Will be my JS code apply with `Four Slide`?

Currently, my JS code like this:

    var $navscroll = $('nav.nav-next');
    $(document).scroll(function() {
    	alert($(this).scrollTop());	
      $navscroll.css({left: $(this).scrollTop()>10 ? ""65%"":""35%""});

2443,2016-12-07 08:14:08,"Hi Alvaro,

I noticed that the `onLeave` callback was firing too soon, which caused my implementation to break when pressing down (next slide) multiple times. The callback would fire, even though the previous animation was not completed yet.

So I added this check in the `keydownHandler()` function. It's not in the same if-statement as the others, because this would sometimes cause a normal ""down"" event to fire, scrolling the page one tick, showing a piece of the next section, and then centering on the proper section again.

Hope you find this helpful.

Regards,
Jorn

What happens?
- On pageload the first element is duplicated and some html added.
- When dom manipulation is ready, fullpage.js will be initialised.
- When you scroll from 1 to 2, the first element is fixed, so you get the effect of a layer being removed. `afterLoad` this element won't be fixed anymore, but since the second image is the same it appears to keep standing.
- When you scroll from 2 to 1, the first element will be fixed again on `onLeave` for the ""layer over"" effect.

Reproduce:
- Start at the topmost section and tap the down key multiple times in quick succession
- Also, move to down to (ie. the 4th) section and tap the up key multiple times in quick succession

The `onLeave` function gets fired too soon (this is production, so no console.logs), so the first element doesn't get toggled `fixed` at the right time.

Note: Currently my fix is being put in production, so the error might not be visible for very long.

Incidentally I have been looking into this and I believe I know the source of the issue. When a section has more content than the available height the content gets wrapped with two divs (fp-scrollable and fp-scroller) - this seems to be what knocks it out. I have added a fixed height of 800px to the form, so if you remove this and reload you'll find the select works.

It doesn't have to be a physical height that triggers this either - if you add enough content to the section so its wrapped within the two divs you'll notice the issue arises too.

Also, you can probably replicate this issue with just iScroll itself and your jQuery element. 
See https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll/issues/783

The iScrolll library has weird issues when it comes to buttons as well:

I have a question with scroll overflow on responsive views. I set the responsive view and on mobile views since scroll overflow is enabled at the first section and inner scroll is visible, the section does not go to the next.

I know responsive auto height kind of solves this issue but I want to suggest an alternate way. If responsive mode is activated and the height already exceeds the window height, it should be converted to auto height. I guess it comes to disabling inner scroll when responsive view is activated.

Is there an alternative for this ?

However, when I need sections to have flexible heights  I need to add custom code to add a scrolling up effect like the below which I have on my home page to scroll up from the tiles section to the intro section to the video:

onLeave: function(index, nextIndex, direction) {
        if ($(""body"").hasClass(""home"")) {
         if(index == 2 && direction =='up'){
           $('html, body').stop().animate({
               scrollTop: $('body').offset().top
           }, 1100, 'easeOutExpo');
           event.preventDefault();
         } else if(index == 3 && direction =='up') {
            $('html, body').stop().animate({
                scrollTop: $('#home-intro').offset().top
            }, 1100, 'easeOutExpo');
            event.preventDefault();
         }
        } else  {
        if(index == 2 && direction =='up'){
          $('html, body').stop().animate({
              scrollTop: $('body').offset().top
          }, 1100, 'easeOutExpo');
          event.preventDefault();
       }

So the above kind of works but when scrolling up from the third section with the tiles to the second with the picture it snaps to the first with the video. What I am looking for is for the effect on scrolling up here to be perfect as when sections are all the same height as in this page https://dashnimorad.com/music/

2427,2016-11-25 08:37:45,"Hi Alvaro,


Loosing my mind over this.. I have done a lot of research, tried forums for help but had no luck.. I have done this whole website based on fullpage.js and it would really be a pain to change it all for something else now. The main problem is in the snap scrolling up in the home page. I need this to snap scroll up as perfectly as it snap scrolls down without skipping any sections. One other thing I'd like to achieve is to have an offset on the top so the fixed header does not overlap sections.  I was wondering if you would be willing to have a look into this for me and how much would you charge for it.


Thank you very much.


Paulo

Sorry but I can't provide you any solution.
I'm being honest. I already spent time trying to solve those kind of situations and didn't find a solution.

2423,2016-11-21 12:18:22,"Hi!

I've encountered a scrolling problem on high resolution displays. When more than one section is present in the viewport, all present sections has to be scrolled through... even though there's nothing to scroll.

Have a look over here for a better understanding:
https://jsfiddle.net/15s3rjjn/6",Bondra,
2423,2016-11-21 12:42:12,"As detailed in the docs:

> This is ideal for footers. It is important to realise that it doesn't make sense to have all of your sections using this feature. **If there is more than one section in the initial load of the site, the plugin won't scroll at all to see the next one as it will be already in the viewport.**

The issue with this approach of having multiple sections totally visible on the viewport at the same time is that fullPage.js can not know which is the active section at the moment.

- Which anchor should it use in the URL? 
- Which state class should it apply to the body element? 
- Which `afterLoad` callback should it fire?  
- To which section, navigation bullet or menu element should it apply the `active` class? 
- Which media elements should it autoplay /pause if they all contain any?

So, the problem is not in forcing fullPage.js to move to the right section on scroll, but in all it entails regarding the state of the website.

Suggestions will be more than appreciated on the matter.

That page is using the current unmodified 2.8.8 version

Each section has a unique graphic backdrop that requires seamless transitioning, while also maintaining the need to have a fixed header at the top and not cropping off areas of the section due to the fixed position element.

This offset allows for the fixed position header at the top to more or less feel as though it's a part of the math that determines scrolling positioning and screen height.

I do not have the modified version on a production website at the time, but having the offset will allow for framing design elements to be present on the very top of each section without getting cutoff.

Hopefully that context helps.

Thank you in advance for your help and your great plugin!

I was wondering if there was a way to accomplish something using FullPage with the Scrolloverflow options for a larger section. I have a few sections and some of them are scrollable;

http://jsfiddle.net/photous/qn084vmn/

- If I scroll down sections, everything works as expected, autoScrolling is on, I jump from section to section and scroll within a section when it is a larger section. So far so good! :)
- The issue is as follow; When I use the anchor or the navigation to move to the last section for example after fullPage has rendered. And then scroll back up to the scrollable section, it doesn't show the entire section from the bottom but hides a part outside the scrollable element and start the section from the top... 

I would love to be able basically to when we jump to a section below the scrollable section using the anchors or navigation, and then scrolling up, we would start the scrollable section from the bottom.

Let me know if I am missing something, or if there is a way to accomplish this.

2414,2016-11-17 17:51:08,"The height of a section is not set correctly on iOS Safari. You may try this out in Xcode Simulator. For example on iPhone 7 Plus the height of the viewport (without toolbar) is 370px, but the fullpage.js height of a section(set by `$(window).height()`) is 414px which includes the toolbar(address bar).

To show this i added a header and a footer which are positioned absolute (top:0 / bottom:0).

Initial:

A solution would be to use window.innerHeight. Interestingly it gives 414px (height with toolbar) on start, but with a timeout of 50ms it gives 370px (correct height without toolbar):

1. Replace all `$(window).height()` with `window.innerHeight`
2. Add a timeOut:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
3. Additionally we need to listen for window changes. For example on rotation sometimes the toolbar gets hidden. Or if the toolbar is hidden and we tap into top screen and the toolbar shows. Or when opening a new tab in iPhone Plus Landscape or on rotation:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I added an additional timeOut within the on resize which only affects iPhone Plus with multiple tabs opened(tab bar visible). In this case again window.innerHeight is wrong until an amount of time. 400ms was the minimum i discovered.

With this 3 changes the height stays always perfect.

If not using the option `verticalCentered: false`the height changes needs to be done to `.fp-tableCell`, too.",MickL,2017-01-10 11:04:04
2414,2016-11-17 18:28:53,"If you find a proper solution feel free to create a PR and I'll review it. 
First of all, for what kind of initialisation is the proposed solution? autoScrolling:false? scrollBar:true? 

This topic has been treated multiple times, some people [suggesting innerHeight](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/pull/1660), others [outerHeight](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/pull/1678)... 
None of them ended up convincing me and none of them were fully tested in all devices/OS. 

Moreover, this address bar behaviour changes depending on the browser, its version  and OS. For example. [iPhone 4 or 5 and users have a different behaviour](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/1659). 

Lets not forget also about portrait vs landscape. The latest safari in iPhone 7:
- Won't show the address bar on landscape when coming from a portrait mode.
- Will show it when accessing directly 
- Will show it when coming from landscape mode **if the cursor was on the address bar**
- And of course, it will only show the top address bar, unlike iPhone 4 that will show both top and bottom.

And this is just one single browser in one single OS. I'm sure others might have their funny behaviours too.

I see also you are talking about `scrollTop`.  I guess you were using `autoScrolling:false`?
This is another point to take into account. The browser (safari) will behave differently depending if you use `scrollBar:true` or `autoScrolling:false` (or the responsive mode gets fired), or if you use `autoScrolling:true`. 
The 1st cases will fire the scroll event and the 2nd won't. Which causes the hiding or showing of the scroll bar while scrolling. 

And again, when firing the scroll event:
- The address bar gets minified (not hidden) when scrolling down
- The whole address bar is shown again when scrolling up quickly
- A minified address bar is shown when scrolling up slowly

Regarding your pictures, simulators might not be accurate. Can you please use a real device or a connection to one from sites such as browserstack.com. And when doing so, specify the version of iOS you are testing it in?
",alvarotrigo,2017-01-10 11:04:04
2414,2016-11-17 19:03:03,"Hey,

a PR may be appropriate but i don't have the time familiarize with all of fullpage.js right now.

The behavior is not fixed to any setting like autoScrolling:false. It is just a fact that the height of a section (which should be 100% height of viewport) is wrong on any iOS device. In my case i needed to have perfect height to position absolute elements(without using position: fixed which is buggy on iPhone Plus).

I tested my approach on all iOS devices: iPhone 5, 6, 6 Plus with and without tabs. iPhone 5 for example has a exclusive bottombar. Also i tested rotating, adding/removing the tab bar, etc and it seems to work perfectly. This covers all points you mentioned. 

I added scrollTop(0) because when you rotate sometimes the iPhone removes the toolbar and leaves a little scroll on the body so it needs to be readjusted to 0. Also the Simulator is very accurate if not 100% like a real device. The OS i used was 10.1.

As I described innerHeight is not always perfect unless using a timeOut. I added fixes for this and an additional fix for iPhone x Plus with toolbar which needs an additional timeOut.

2414,2016-11-19 14:13:03,"I figured out that the window doesn't always gets updated when the tab-bar comes in/gets removed until a scroll happens. Therefor no resize-event is fired. I needed to add a setInterval using `$(window).scrollTop(-1);` which updates window if tab-bar came in. I don't see any disadvantages in other browsers. This interval is probably not what you want in your project, but it is the only way to detect and update the real height of the viewport on Mobile Safari.

I tested on iPad Air 2, iPhone 7 Plus (Simulator) and on a Android Marshmallow Phone in Chrome and default browser.

But if you type window.innerHeight into console it is 370px without tab-bar and 337px with tab-bar which is the actual viewport. Also verticalCentered: true will not be perfectly centered cause of the wrong height.

2414,2017-03-01 13:00:18," window.innerHeight is good. But it doesn't delivers the right value from the start. Also following cases change the viewport:

- After Rotation
- Statusbar visible
- Statusbar collapsed (on scroll)
- Bottombar (iPhone 5)
- Tabbar visible (iPhone x Plus)

The problem is that the viewport, readable by window.innerHeight, does not update immediatly. And in some cases it doesn't update at all until there is a scroll (e.g. when the tabbar comes in). Thats why i added all those fixes, timeouts and scrolling to fix all of those problems and different behavior of devices.

If you still dont believe me, here is the proof:

Just open Simulator and try out something. Also you will notice that if you type in window.innerHeight it is the right height while .section and .fp-TableCell is wrong. 

Btw. this is the same for pagePiling.js

Maybe i write a blog post about this if i got the time. Also i could write a little script that always gives the right height and you can subscribe to viewport-changes.",MickL,2017-01-10 11:04:04

But in this case, I think I would prefer to keep them to maintain older versions just in case. 

It seems `-webkit` still being used in the latest version of _UC Browser for Android_ (used by 9% globally [according to caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#search=transition) (click ""show all""), more than IE 10 and 11 combined or than the latest versions of Firefox and Chrome!).

Regarding `moz` and `o`, I guess it doesn't make sense to remove them from a function which purpose is to detect old browsers with no support for translate3d transitions?
The `moz` prefix, for example, [is required up to Firefox 10 and Opera 22 to support `translate3d`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=transforms3d).

2407,2016-11-15 19:01:51,"### Description

Apple clickpads have ""momentum"" which continue sending scroll events for a period of time after the user stops scrolling and can cause fullPage.js to move through multiple sections when the user only intended to move through one. This is a solution to the problem that still allows users to quickly scroll through sections.

The solution is written to work with fullPage.js externally, and while I've ported it from a slightly more project-specific implementation using es6, I don't have the time to learn the fullPage.js codebase and integrate the solution there. Maybe someone more capable would be willing to take the task on, but it seemed useful to have a working solution out there either way.

The logic is to have a mouse scroll event trigger two timeouts and prevent scrolling until one of them finishes:

1. The first timeout is 100 milliseconds long and gets cleared + restarted each time a scroll event takes place, meaning it only concludes once the user has stopped scrolling for 100ms.
2. The second timeout is 1.1 seconds long and ensures that if momentum and the user's scroll pattern is preventing scroll events from ever stopping, fullPage.js will move to the next section every 1.1 seconds.

When either timeout finishes, the other is cleared and the `mouseScrolling` flag is set to false, resetting things until the next scroll event occurs.

There's an initial check to ensure the delta is either `1` or `-1` before running any functionality. This is because at least some configurations with the latest Apple OS trigger a wheel event with a delta starting at 0 before ramping up.

> I cant find a way to reuse iScroll inside my menu div. It is showing a console error Uncaught TypeError: this._init is not a function(…)

You should probably be using the file in the vendors folder `scrolloverflow.min.js`. Which is a fork of iScroll.
But in any case, the problem is not in fullPage.js code and therefore it doesn't seem to be a fullPage.js issue.

Use the option `scrollOverflow` or the fullpage.js function `setAllowScrolling` to toggle the scroll when using the other library.

Regarding close button. Make sure you are using the lastest fullpage.js 2.8.8.

And the esc key. Use `setKeyboardScrolling` to toggle it.

I love your plugin and I would like to use it on our website. Everything works perfectly to me except other jQuery plugins which apparently have issues with their triggers that are not being fired. 

Specifically, the plugins which should do an action on scroll, e.g. number counter which starts counting when you scroll down to it. Or the similar animations... 

you can see it in this short [screen capture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B82dmrWl19iSMXFIZlNRbXN0Q0k/view)

It works fine on the first scroll screen, but on the others not.  However, if you for example try to zoom in 
and increase the font size, it starts. There is probably a conflict with fullPage and other jQuery plugins which have onscroll triggers. Do you have any idea how to fix it?

1. Create a normal page, here are my options: 
	$(document).ready(function() {
	    $('#page').fullpage({
	    	autoScrolling: false,
	    	fitToSection: false,
	    	touchSensitivity: true,

- If you resize the window when on the first slide, the slide does not move, just its content resizes.
- If you do that from the second slide, that causes the slide to slip on the left outside the viewport before re-centering again.

2376,2016-11-04 18:08:55,"> Is there any solution to have every slide behaving like the first one?

Nop.

FullPage.js needs to calculate the width and height of each section and slide, and then fix the position of the slides in the slider. ( and check if scrollbar is necessary when using scrollOverflow)

This is done every [300 milliseconds](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/jquery.fullPage.js#L2067) to improve performance. 
You can try to change it to 0, but manually resizing the window will create a laggy experience (most noticeable yet in old or slow computers ). 
This is because when you manually resize the window hundreds of resize events are being fired. Which will imply having to calculate and modify the dom hundreds of times per second.

The problem is due to `autoScrolling` check in `preventBouncing()` function. When it's `true`, in touch devices, it will `preventDefault()` `touchmove` event from `body`, which is why any scrollable div won't work out of the box. I commented out the code and haven't seen any downside/bug (except probably for the obvious bouncing -in iOS- which I believe the reason of why the function exist...)

Just a suggestion, but maybe add an option to enable/disable this or a note in the docs that the user will need custom handler to handle the scrolling in inner div for mobile?

The bouncing is quite a big problem that affects many people. 
Instead It seems to me yours is a more isolated case and that very few people will have to deal with. 

I won't take any action here so far. It is quite possible that a near future release of fullPage.js (probably the next one) won't require the `preventDefault`.

According to [this comment](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/2129#issuecomment-244349467) in #2129, `jquery.fullpage.js` should be camelCase: `jquery.fullPage.js`

Have I misunderstood how the anchors option is supposed to work? I am using the anchors option inside the fullpage init function, trying to add an anchor point specifically to the second slide. Sections are generated dynamically (WordPress), so I can't hard-code the data-anchor into each section. I do know that I want my anchor to be the second section though, so there's no need for any anchors on any other section.

$('#fullpage-slider').fullpage({
...
anchors:['fullpage-home, fullpage-featured-homes-anchor'],
...
});

This configuration seems to add a data-anchor only to the first section:
data-anchor=""fullpage-home, fullpage-featured-homes-anchor""
...but nothing added to subsequent sections.

I thought the second comma-separated value in this option would be applied to the second section, etc as more values are added.

It also throws an unexpected error:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined

Any insight? Thanks-

2366,2016-10-30 20:06:43,"Hi Álvaro,

Thanks for pointing out my careless mistake. Works as-expected when I correct the quotations.

I'm still struggling with a solution though, because the way this page works is:
1st Section = Hero
2nd Section = Start of Dynamic Sections (this is the location I want to anchor to)
... As many sections as generated by WordPress (each would have the same data-anchor if added to mark-up, as it is part of the WordPress loop)
Last Section = Footer

So if I add the data-anchor to the 2nd section, which is where I want my page to slide to, that anchor is getting repeated and makes the anchor system fail.

I suppose what would be ideal is to just be able to put the anchor in the init options for section 1 and 2 (or even just section 2) because this much is always reliable, while the following sections will be variable. Seems that this throws errors if the option setting is not complete with all sections.

I may try to add a loop inside the init options which iterates over all sections after they render. Not sure if it will work but seems like a possible option.

Any other thoughts? Thanks again already-

Of course it does. It is suppose to work that way. 
The only difference is the autoScrolling is turned off as detailed in the docs:

> **responsiveHeight:** (default 0) **A normal scroll (autoScrolling:false) will be used under the defined height in pixels**. A class fp-responsive is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for his own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's height is less than 900 the plugin will **scroll like a normal site.**

According to [Chrome docs](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/5093566007214080) events are treated as passive by default. In fact, this is why [this other fullPage.js issue ](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/2311) was raised.
It seems your Chrome is interpreting the event listener as passive. But clearly mine doesn't and neither the ones in Browserstack.  I would say that a default installation of Chrome wouldn't treat events by default as passive.

So the problem is clearly in your Chrome.
Check out [this docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1II7oSIpd8pK91V5kEM3tDLKcIj398jOJn8Niqy6_loI/edit) and see how you can change the default behaviour of Chrome for passive events by accessing your chrome flags: `chrome://flags` and changing the property `

Becuase `onSlideLeave` is only for slides. Not for sections. 
You need to use `onLeave` instead.

To get the slide you can always use the `active` classs applied to the active section and active slide. 
Something like:

Or I would probably recommend you to call `$.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(false, 'down');` and `$.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(false, 'up');`. on the callback `afterSlideLoad`. Maybe easier.

2) Scroll right  gets me to Section 2 - slide 2
3) Scroll down and up now shoudn't do anything! 

So, on slides, more then 1, I would like just to left and right to work. My wish is when user gets in slide 2, he can go left and right, but when on slide 1, he again can go up and down.

In your docs I've found:

Like this:

In your case you might want to use it in [the callbacks provided by fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#callbacks).

If that's not enough for you, then you need to learn Javascript / jQurery. You'd better ask in other place such as http://stackoverflow.com/ for basic Javascript knowledge.

Nop. 

The most you can do is something like what suggested in [this topic](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/200) by using the interlocked slides extension. 
But in any case, you will never be able to go from slide 2 section 3 to slide 3 section 1. (slides are the horizontal ones and sections the vertical ones) 
You'll always have to move on the same section level if you want to turn right or left.

- I added the corresponding data-menuanchor to every list item as well as href=""#pageAnchor""
-  I used the menu on my computer, it worked fine. I used it on my phone, none of the buttons go anywhere, even if i try making them links to a different site.

The more you can do is use `showActiveTooltip` that will show not only the bullets but also the tooltip text of the current active section.

Your solution can be overwriting the CSS applied to the tooltips and make them always visible. Then, hide the bullets.

Easy uh? :)

Firstly, thanks for creating such an amazing plugin - great work!

Just noticed the inline style properties on div#fullpage within Safari aren't being set consistently like they are in Chrome in two ways:
1. When scrolling from section to section within Safari the inline translate3d does not increment by the height of the viewport like it does in Chrome.
2. When loading a section, e.g http://rorymstaging.wpengine.com/stack/#corporateexperience, sometimes the style properties are added and sometimes they are not. E.g sometimes when loading this section I get the following:

`<div class=""section-container fullpage-wrapper"" id=""fullpage"">`

Do you think this is affecting the positioning and causing the Vimeo bug?

2339,2016-10-17 18:52:59,"Hello,

I'm having a problem with the onloadedmeta function that resizes my background video.

It works perfectly when accessing the page directly either through the navigation or inputting the page with the section id with the video.

If the section id I'm trying to access is not the section with the background video I see the below error - in this scenario the video resizes correctly but the remaining pages are 144px out from the top (this error fixes itself when I then go to scroll through sections).

**Error:** Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The play() request was interrupted by a call to pause().

When I try to access the page using any section id other than the section id that contains the background video the above error is not thrown and the pages resize correctly - but the video does not. The video is just the default size.

I haven't actually noticed this problem previously and some of the aforementioned issues do seem somewhat sporadic. Today I've been created the footer (which contains no JS) and adjusted my mobile menu a little but nothing different to what it was in terms of JS.

I've pasted the JS file below - as you'll see I'm using Fullpage in conjunction with Smoothstate.

If anyone has any suggestions or feedback I'd be eternally grateful.

Thanks very much in advance for your time,

Kind regards

Tom

**For a project we needed the resetSLides plugin. In order for this to work we included the fullpage.extensions.min.js. This caused HTML5 video's to keep playing after you switch sections (vertical). It pauses the video's when you shift slides (horizontal).**
### Steps to reproduce it
1. Used standard code for HTML5 video using the fullpage docs data-src and data-autoplay features with fullpage.js included > everything works fine.
2. Included fullpage.resetSliders.min.js and fullpage.extensions.min.js > video's do not pause anymore on section leave only on slide leave
3. Switched back to fullpage.js (with fullpage.resetSliders.min.js) > everything back to normal
4. Back to extensions.min.js > Switched off concatenation and minifying just to be sure > video pausing issue re-ocurred.

> Smooth scrolling performance is essential to a good experience on the web, especially on touch-based devices. All modern browsers have a threaded scrolling feature to permit scrolling to run smoothly even when expensive JavaScript is running, but this optimization is partially defeated by the need to wait for the results of any touchstart and touchmove handlers, which may prevent the scroll entirely by calling preventDefault() on the event. While there are particular scenarios where an author may indeed want to prevent scrolling, analysis indicates that the majority of touch event handlers on the web never actually call preventDefault(), so browsers often block scrolling unneccesarily. 

And I guess they prefer to show a warning when calling preventDefault ?

2299,2016-09-30 19:38:32,"### Description

I needed to group several pages under same Menu item. I searched a bit how to approach it and found Issue with the same problem (#1354), where it was recommended to use callbacks to achieve this. So I started to work on it, but I found out that with the order of calls of the callbacks it is not really possible to implement it.

The thing is that `activateMenuAndNav()` is called after the callbacks are fired, which completely cancel out effects on active class on Menu of `onLeave()` callback (which I think is natural place to put such a code to). If you use `afterLoad()` callback than it works, but there is really ugly moment when the Menu item doesn't have Active class assigned during animation period, which is not really possible to use such a solution.
### Link to isolated reproduction with no external CSS / JS

https://jsfiddle.net/AuHau/gc3gnb7c/
### Steps to reproduce it
1. Go to next page
2. The first menu item, should stay active, but there is small period when it blinks ""off"" and ""on"".
### Versions

Linux, Chrome, fullPage.js edge
### Proposed solution

Since I was going through the code I immediately wrote a fix for my webpage and I would like to make PR with the fix, but I didn't really managed to cover all cases.
[Here is link](https://github.com/AuHau/fullPage.js/commit/c21c993cc335662c820ae8025fa861e5b2577e4a) to my commit. 

I reordered the `activateMenuAndNav()` and now it works for cases when the `autoScrolling = true`, then it also works as expected when `autoScrolling = false` and `fitToSection = false`, but with `autoScrolling = false` and `fitToSection = true` there is an issue that when the `scrollPage()` is called in the `fitToSection` phase, the callbacks are not fired. That will again delete the active class from the Menu item. Since I don't really know the code by heart, I am not sure how to fix it, so suggestions would be appreciated.

I my case I want to manually scroll to the top of the section when it is loaded, so in `afterLoad` I get the scroll instance and do `scroller.scrollTo(0,0,0)`. However this does scroll the ""extra"" scrollbar but not the default one. So if I for example come from the bottom and scroll up, it doesn't scroll to the top. The default scrollbar is still in the bottom and it seems that one takes precedence over the added one. I'm not sure exactly what's going on actually.

I see that `.fp-scrollable` has `overflow: scroll`. This seems to add a default browser scrollbar that has nothing to do with the scrolloverflow-plugin, and anything you do with the plugin is not related to this scroller. If I set it to `visible`, only the scrollOverflow-plugin is used for scrolling the sections. 

Adding fp-auto-height or fp-auto-height-responsive didn't work that well. The sections get the scrollbars before responsive is kicked in.

SCSS is not a distributable file and therefore you should not be working with it unless you want to change it.

I am installing via npm and i believe it's the `files`-property in package.json that includes the .scss file when doing npm install. Currently i am removing the .scss file in a postinstall script on my end because it causes some issues with having both a .css and .scss file with the same name when importing within a .scss-file.

Maybe when installing via npm the dist-folder should be included as well? This would actually help me with choosing the right file.

I sorry but I have no real experience with contributing to open source projects, so I'm not sure what type of pull request that would be fitting in this case. Perhaps it could be a good idea for you to create a ""discussion issue"" of some sort where more involved people could discuss if moving from css to sass is a good idea or not.

I have one problem:

Steps
1) I add favicon.ico to my page.  `<link href=""/favicon.ico"" rel=""icon"">`
2) Set `scrollBar: true`.
3) When I do scrolling with mousewheel my `favicon.ico` is reloaded on each scrolling.(disappears and appears in browser tab)
- if I set `scrollBar: false` it works ok, but `scrollBar: true` is necessary for my site.
  I reproduce this on Google 51, and other modern browsers.

I can't create https://jsfiddle.net, because I can't add favicon to fiddle.

",alvarotrigo,
2282,2016-09-24 13:35:21,"I just thought that I'd file the bug since the `responsiveWidth` isn't necessarily always accurate and would make sense to either include that caveat in the documentation or use the correct screen width/height values.

The problem which this is causing me is that the `responsiveWidth` is triggered at the wrong breakpoint which interferes with some of the styling/behaviour of the page in that small breakpoint window (size of the scrollbar).

E.g. if you're meant to disable the fullpage.js functionality at `768px`, if the scrollbar is visible, it's only disabled at `756px - scrollBarWidth`.

If you're inside the `responsiveWidth` breakpoint, the scrollbar is also visible, which makes increasing the screen width to `769px` (1px over the breakpoint) not trigger the full screen scrolling.

Hope that all makes sense.

My proposed solution would be something along the lines of:

It'd be advisable to do something similar for the responsive height too (not relevant to my current use-case however).

I think the proposed solution should still work with #1678, because it should fallback to [$window.outerWidth()](http://stackoverflow.com/a/17845094/4857127) if `window.innerWidth` does return 0 (we could amend the code to check for non-positive values too).

The height is probably best left alone in that case until someone raises a ticket for it.

iOS mobile Chrome browser.

I have a multi section page using fullPage.js, works perfect in every situation except mobile Chrome browser due to Chrome's ""pull down to reload page"" feature.

If you try to scroll up (by sliding finger down) it will reload to the page. If you play with it some you'll find that sliding fast will allow you to scroll normally, but if you slide in a more natural way like someone used to scrolling on a website, it'll ""stick"" at first then just reload the page, instead of sliding up to the next page.

It causing an exceedingly poor user experience as any time the user tries to scroll up they see that little chrome menu bar with the reload/close/back buttons.

It seems Chrome tries to reload the website when swiping down (to go up) around the middle half area of the viewport.

I'll have to check it with time, meanwhile I would encourage you to use the `responsiveWidth` or `responsiveHeight` options for small viewport devices.

2277,2016-09-21 16:38:51,"Thanks, I really want to make it work as a fullPage site even on mobile so responsiveWidth/Height won't really work for me.

In testing this out with various solutions found online the root of the issue seems to stem from the fact that window.pageYOffset is always 0, regardless of where the user is on the page. This seems central to how fullPage.js operates which makes sense; however, Chrome detects for a scroll up when the window.pageYOffset=0 and enables the pull to refresh at that time.

fullpage.js is already preventing the default touchMove event (to solve the issue in Safari iOS) and it seems Chrome doesn't care about it.
",alvarotrigo,2016-10-12 12:12:20

Seems the crux of the issue is the yOffset always being 0 in a fullPage.js site and Chrome's decision on what to do when that's the case, since it thinks it's at the top of the site...

I was able to preventDefault for all touchMoves, which works as written; however... this breaks all scrolling as it prevents fullPage from capturing the event. Maybe there's to tack that onto the end for touchmove (if going up, if not at top, do fullPage scroll up and then preventDefault)

If you try to scroll up (by sliding finger down) it will reload to the page. If you play with it some you'll find that sliding fast will allow you to scroll normally, but if you slide in a more natural way like someone used to scrolling on a website, it'll ""stick"" at first then just reload the page, instead of sliding up to the next page.

It causing an exceedingly poor user experience as any time the user tries to scroll up they see that little chrome menu bar with the reload/close/back buttons.

I have a big background video on one section. The intended behaviour is that it does't autoplay on mobile devices. This is true for Safari. 

If you put `<meta name=""apple-mobile-web-app-capable"" content=""yes"" />` into the head and save the website to the homescreen and open it from there, it will autoplay.

2266,2016-09-16 07:00:53,"Hi,

I've stumbled across a problem which I think would be very nice to have.
So this is more like a feature proposal.

I am very happy with the implementation of iScroll and as I started using this feature I came across this:
I want to use i.e. the `snap` option in `scrollOverflowOptions`.
As all my sections are structured differently I only need/want this snap in one section.
If I now pass a selector in snap, iScroll starts to look in every(!) scroller for there objects and throws an error if it can't find any.
So what do you think about different scrollOverflowOptions for each scroller?
Or alternatively pass a function which returns a string.

What are your thoughts about this or do you think there would be a better way of resolving this problem?

thank you for your time,
janein

P.S: even if I don't like the fullpage-concept very much I am really thankful for your work on this plugin because designers do not ask for my opinion most of the time :laughing:

My recommendation to you is to destroy fullpage.js and reBuild it again without the  `snap` option whenever you land in a page which is not the one with the snapping scrolling. (or the other way around, just do it for that single section)
This should be transparent for the end user.

Beside other problems with rebuilding (scrolls down from top every time) I think this will not prevent the error to be thrown as all scrollers are initialized when fullpage is build and not when the section is loaded.

So i.e. if I have my snapping-markup only in the first section I still get the error for all other overflowing sections.

I also tried to only update iScroll but it seems that it isn't possible to change the snap-option dynamically.

Looks like this problem can not be solved easily.
Is there another way the prevent a section-change by mistake when scrolling to the end of a scrollable section?

In javascript version of fullpage.js there is no option to lock anchors like in the jquery version.So I just deleted 1259th line on which you are calling setState function, and anchors are Locked.
So you can add variable called LockAnchors and give a value false just like in jquery version and on line 1259 write this
if(LockAnchors==false){
setState(slideIndex, slideAnchorLink, v.anchorLink, v.sectionIndex);
}
You can see the problem with LockAnchors=false on mobile devices ,especially in landscape ,every time when user changes section all bars show up,and than the window.width is almost 2 times the window.height and the website looks awfully.

I want to integrate this with a wordpress site, on varying length articles, to give horizontal transitions between pages.
I have it somewhat working using SwipeView (https://github.com/cubiq/SwipeView) but it's somewhat limited and a little buggy in my implementation.

I would run an archive loop, so that the front page would 5-10 fulllength articles, each wrapped in a `<DIV>` to form the structure of the different pages.  These would transition horizontally, with each article being a different length that should scroll vertically for as long as the article is.

We have prepared some examples:

Example 1: http://demo.gisdata.si/fullPage/example.html
fullPage is not included and the dropdown works correctly

Example 2: http://demo.gisdata.si/fullPage/example1.html
fullPage is included but with scrollOverflow set to its default value of false, the click event registers and the drop down works

Example 3: http://demo.gisdata.si/fullPage/example2.html
fullPage is included and the property scrollOverflow is set to true, in scrollOveflowOptions click is set to true if it's a touch device and false if it's not, I removed the slide in this example god knows why(it logs the success into the console instead), on the emulator it registers the clicking events(unless in landscape mode) but while testing on my phone it does not work at all

Example 4: http://demo.gisdata.si/fullPage/example3.html
this is the same as above except preventDefault: false is added to scrollOverflowOptions, it reproduces the same behavior

Example 5: http://demo.gisdata.si/fullPage/example4.html
same as the above but the click in scrollOverflowOptions is set to false, now the click events start working as expected

So my question is as it follows. Why does it work with click set to false when your proposed solution was to have it on true for touch devices. Do you have any ideas? Also a follow-up question. Should any issues with scrolling be reported to the iScroll GitHub page or do you have any information on it? The problem is now that on the Android tablet I'm using to test the website the scrolling is not very good. It moves a small distance on every swipe up/down and sometimes it jumps for three times the amount. Works perfectly on my Android phone. On an iPad, it's also a little jumpy on the section containing the map in it, but the other slide works just fine.

Love your plugin, I would really like to make the website work with it

2253,2016-09-10 14:33:53,"Hi Alvarotrigo

First of all, got to say we love your work ... keep it up.

New versions of Chrome and Firefox browsers on Android mobile devices (eg Samsung Galaxy S7), do this silly thing where the address bar drops down or hides when you change scrolling direction. This has the effect of changing the browser height.

So when FullPage is running in responsive mode on these devices, we observe an issue where the first scroll in a direction, causes the address bar to appear/hide, which then causes FullPage to try to re-anchor. This results in a disrupted scroll from a user perspective.

you can see this on your demo when run using one of these new style browsers: http://www.alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/responsiveSlides.html#firstPage2

Maybe we've missed a pre-existing switch in your initialisation settings. But it would be great if we could set an switch on FullPage instantiation to prevent re-anchoring of pages when in responsive mode.

Thanks again.

Edit 1: Oh I should have added, we're now on your latest version 2.8.6.

http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/normalScroll.html

> which then causes FullPage to try to re-anchor. This results in a disrupted scroll from a user perspective.

What do you mean by re-anchor? What kind of scroll disruption do you suffer from?
fullpage.js does not resize unless the change of the viewport is more than 20% in mobile devices.

Could you provide a video?
Are you sure you are not talking about the option `fitToSection`?
",alvarotrigo,2016-09-10 15:12:19
2253,2016-09-10 15:10:14,"Oh ok ... so to show you an example, you can reproduce the behaviour on a desktop.
1. Go to the link above
2. Resize the screen to responsive mode ... similar to the size of a mobile browser
3. scroll the half way between slide 1.2 and 1.3 ... so the text 1.2 is disappearing of the top of the page and 1.3 is just appearing at the bottom of the page
4. Now resize the vertical hight of the window by just a couple of pixels.
5. The resulting behaviour is that the nearest slide is centered on the window again.

So now imagine your on a mobile device scrolling down and the address bar disappears, increasing the size of the window. Now the scroll gets interrupted as Full page tries to centre the nearest content on the page.

Hope that makes sense

What I have is not an issue but a question. I hope the author answers it even if it's not formatted in the proper Issue way (sorry about that!). Here it goes:

Is it possible to have a section: 1) taller than the viewport and 2) normally scrolled (and I don't mean with a scrollbar, just without the 'fast' scroll)?

I'm working in [this](http://dapp.cloud.fgv.br/validar/observatorio-do-rio/) prototype, which will soon become a project. I wish I could use fullPage.js in it since I've already used the plugin many other times and I'm a big fan of it.

The problem is, in any of the examples and Issues found here I'd found a situation like this one. So I'm asking myself it fullPage.js is the right choice for this project. (currently the scrolling effect is done with other plugin).

Thanks a lot,

2238,2016-09-01 16:01:25,"> Is it possible to have a section: 1) taller than the viewport and

Yeah. When using `autoScrolling:false` you can use `fp-auto-height` to create smaller or bigger sections as pointed out in [Creating smaller or bigger sections](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#creating-smaller-or-bigger-sections)

If you want to keep autoScrolling, the only option is using scrollOverflow:true as [in this demo](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/scrolling.html).
Want to remove the scroll bar? Just check [iScroll.js options](http://iscrolljs.com/) and you'll probably be able to turn it off by passing the custom options in the `scrolloverflowOptions` option provided by fullpage.js

The other option is you can yourself create an scrollable element, assign to it the `normalScrollElements` option and then detect with your own javascript code if the user reached the top or bottom of it so you can manually call `moveSectionUp` or `moveSectionDown`.
This last option might not work as well for touch devices tough.

2238,2016-09-01 19:07:50,"Hi Alvaro, thanks for the response.

I've tried what you've said and it did work. It didn't allow for `fp-auto-height` though. Instead, it turned my section in 100% height and made the content scrollable with an invisible scrollbar, as I wanted. In the end it did look good and I may stick with that. You can see [here](http://dapp.cloud.fgv.br/validar/observatorio-do-rio/) the results.

Just for note, I've tried to put `fp-auto-height` in the content sections (to let them be taller than the viewport) and set `normalScrollElements` to that same sections in the script, hoping they will be scrolled normally but it didn't work. Everything was auto scrolled. I guess maybe `normalScrollElements` isn't meant for that.

2234,2016-08-30 16:17:02,"### Description

I working on web aplication, and we have mobile version of it. So we use ur library and we have sections that have full screen size. In mobile devices with landscape orientation we can`t use full screen size of sections, cause of small height - our content does not fit. So for landscapes we decide switch off autoscroll between sections with $.fn.fullpage.setAutoScrolling(false); and set height to sections the same as portrait orientation, so our content fit well.

So we look at event orientationchange, and when is triggered, we check this is landscape or not?
When it become landscape, we remember the hash. And afterResize event (this is full page js event)  we change height of sections and go to section with hash that we have remembered earlier.

On android devices - is all right.

The problems come true in Ios devises, like iPhone 6s. The event afterResize is triggered earlier then orientationchange event. And this is crazy, cause orientationchange must trigger 
instantly when we change the device orientation. And afterResize must trigger, when the ful page js done resizing (This callback is fired after resizing the browser's window. Just after the sections are resized.)

I made workaround of that problem by setting the timeout in afterResize callback function. Also i create new variable for landscape mobile hash, that can`t be change when the section is not correct. That var get value only when we  change orientation on our mobile device.

2232,2016-08-30 14:15:51,"Hi Alvaro,

When setting padding top and bottom options of fullpage, everything works great, but sometimes fixed headers have responsive heights. When setting padding top of sections with CSS, section height is autocalculated by the browser since it's padding and box sizing is set, but the inner table height isn't autocalculated and remains the same as full height, (instead of full height - padding top). Since then, vertical align middle doesn't work as expected. 

You can see the problem here:
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/qaWRpJ

As you can see on the codepen, even though the browser is sized under 960px, the text ""ONE"" doesn't move up as expected. 

Is there a way to autocalculate inner table height according to CSS?

I might suggest two options here, first one is adding a new responsive padding option, the second one is changing the **getTableHeight** function return value for inner heights. 

Thank you for your help,
",meceware,2016-08-30 16:39:26
2232,2016-08-30 16:39:26,"Just use CSS to set your own padding top:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This way you have the freedom to do whatever you want with it. 
Fullpage.js only provides the paddingTop option for basic users.
",alvarotrigo,2016-08-30 16:39:26
2232,2016-08-30 18:39:39,"Yes, even if I add the padding top CSS, inner table height doesn't change and vertical align middle of inner table shifts down. 

Let me give you an example. I updated the codepen a little with the true paddings.
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/qaWRpJ

As you see, the content is in the middle vertically,

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16402717/18101894/31c944de-6ef9-11e6-9804-b2b05b977bf4.png)

Now, remove paddingTop option of fullpage, and try again, as given in this codepen. (everything is the same but paddingTop option of fullpage is removed.)
http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ORLjgm

Even though the content is in the middle, since the inner table height is full screen, the content is shifted.

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16402717/18102003/a8ee059a-6ef9-11e6-9fcc-2b160371434b.png)

This happens because of ""fp-tableCell"" div height is full screen, instead paddings should be subtracted from the height. It is calculated in getTableHeight function, which only considers the paddingTop and paddingBottom options only, instead of the CSS.

I mean the scrolling within a slide. The site you see is only one section with horizontal slides.
I'm using scrollOverflow: true:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

In every slide there's a normalScrollElement (.innersection).

I mentioned the magic mouse because safari has many mouse functionality with the last osx update.
So I have to scroll with to fingers with it (it's so weird) but if I plug a normal mouse the wheel works fine. Maybe it's a issue due to the translateY property (css3) that in your library replaced the normal scroll event.

If in system preferences I disable the mouse scroll inertia it doesn't scroll neither with two fingers.

I hope my explanation is enough for you.

Hi,

I am developing a page having full height sections and in which different kind of animation occurs and it is interdependent and i have written my code in onLeave function. Now if i am scrolling the page normally i.e one after other section then it is working fine but when i am using anchors to move from one section to other, i want to call onLeave Function for each and every section which comes in between my current section and my destination section. So that animation occurs for each and every section rather then just trigger onLeave function for destination section.

Here is the Example 

In this [example ](http://codepen.io/PriyankaM/pen/NAVzwx)\- there is a string in LHS which inputs the index of section. Over here i want to index of each and every section that comes in between if move from Section 1 to Section 5 rather than just showing 1-2 index

First of all, wonderful plugin been having lots of fun with it.

However I do want to ask a question which might or might not be a bit silly, as I am relatively new to javascript plugins. I can't seem to find a question about it so here goes:

Is Flexbox incompatible with this plugin? It would appear as if my entire layout in set in CSS is being disregarded, as of the moment I incorporate the plugin in my project.

You can apply it inside seach section or slide as you wish. The only thing fullpage.js does is creating the sections and slides height and width or centering it if you use `verticalCentered:true`

I'm having a small issue where I have a overlay that pops up, which I want to scroll normally. If a user opens the overlay and beings to scroll through the content is flips to the next section. However if they open the overlay, click on the overlay, the normal scroll elements option takes effect and you're able to do see the rest of the content. Have you experienced this problem before?

Simulating a click or focus on my overlay or it's inner contents is not working either.

Unfortunately do to the fact that I have an overlay that requires styles, I am unable to provide a clean code example. I can provide a link to the full site if you're willing to take a look.

Love the plugin it's absolutely fab!
I got two problems:
1. . I'm really a js noob... There's a problem with the loading of an other plugin I use: MasterSlider Pro.. I get: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined
   I understand I have to do something with after render to load the plugin or it's js files? But how do I do that I already got:

`<script type=""text/javascript"">
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $('#fullpage').fullpage({
autoScrolling: false,
anchors: ['home', 'project1', 'project2', 'project3', 'project4', 'project5', 'project6', 'project7', 'project8', 'project9', 'project10', 'project11', 'project12', 'project13', 'project14', 'project15']
        });
        });
    </script>`
2. On mobile and tablet when I scroll, the sections get cut off at the top, so basically they scroll up too much. Is this something I can fix with a setting in fullpage.js or is it related to something else like CSS (which in that case you don't need to answer of course...

I want to change active anchor when I scrolled exactly to the top of next section, not to middle of current section.
### Steps to reproduce it
1. Switch to mobile view on this [example](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/responsive.html#firstPage)
2. You can see that anchor ""Second slide"" change class to ""active"" when green section scrolled just to middle of the screen. http://take.ms/ev6ui
### How to fix

We can add new option, like `scrollRatio` . Anchor should change class to ""active"" when page scrolled to the top of next section (`scrollRatio: 0`). Default would be `scrollRatio: .5`.

**We can change this code**
`var screen_mid = currentScroll + ($window.height() / 2.0);`
**to**
`var screen_mid = currentScroll + ($window.height() * options.scrollRatio);`
",Splintex,
2209,2016-08-18 09:22:12,"Not a bad idea. 
The problem with that is that there are more things depending on the section's `active` class, such as `fitToSection`, the play or pause of media elements, the section to fit in the viewport when passing from `autoScrolling:false` to `autoScrolling:true`, which slider to slide when using horizontal arrows or invoking the `moveSlideRight` or `moveSlideLeft` functions etc. 
And that can lead to undesirable results. 

I believe it would be much more simple to just add a class such as `fp-entering`.
This way it would also be consistent with the existing state class `fp-completely`, which is not yet documented and probably needs a change of name anyways.

I've read the FAQ and a couple of kind of related issues, but I can't seem to find a feasible answer for the problem I'd like to solve. Heres what I'd like to do:
- imagine 3 sections.
- the first section is just a normal section. you scroll down to the next section using your mouse wheel.
- on the 2nd section if you keep scrolling instead of jumping to the 3rd section right away, you want to do some parallax/animation according to your scrollpos just within that section.
- as soon as you scroll to a certain threshold and your animation is finished you jump to section 3 and go back to fullpage.js ""normal"" scroll/jump behaviour to go to the next section.

I feel like I'd need `scrollBar: true` and potentially also `slideOverflow: true` for this but I don't really know how to combine those or how to use parallax just within one section and not the whole page. Any hints?

Cheers,
Christian
",schnubor,2016-08-12 09:41:04
2197,2016-08-12 09:41:04,"`scrollBar:true` won't help you here as it won't allow you to scroll inside the same section. 
`scrollBar:true` would only help if you want to have parallax effects when moving between sections. This is, causing jumps from one to another section and stopping. (similar to what you see in [this site](http://medoff.ua/en/)) Which seems it is not what you want in this case.

You can try it by using `scrollOverflow:true` for that parallax section. This way you'll be able to ""scroll"" inside the section and stop whenever you want.
scrollOverflow uses a forked and modified version of iScroll.js as detailed in the docs.
This means you should use iScroll.js in order to get the position of the scroll.

Unfortunatelly it seems the default iScroll.js doesn't provide such option and you'll have to go for the `iscroll-probe.js` version as detailed in [the custom events section of its docs](http://iscrolljs.com/#custom-events).

And I say unfortunatelly because this means you'll have to modify a single line I modified when forking iScroll.js. Check [this issue](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll/issues/1041) to know which line I'm referring to.

Hope this helps!

Hi there,

Please check out [my website](https://studio.siamkreative.com/) on mobile using Chrome Developer Tools. You'll notice I use the pure JavaScript version. For some reasons, only on mobiles, the following JS error shows up and scrolling is not working: `Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'removeEventListener' on 'EventTarget': 2 arguments required, but only 1 present.`

The same issue shows up on the demo: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/pure-javascript/.

I'm aware that the JavaScript version is in a beta, but I'm hoping I can get some help to fix it. If not, is there another library that you would recommend?

You can not use internal anchors inside a scrollOverflow section. That's actually a [iscroll.js issue](https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll/issues/5) and not a fullpage.js one.

That's call normal scroll :) As in [this example](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/normalScroll.html).
Just use `autoScrolling:false` for that. Then using `fitToSection` and you'll be able to land in the right section.

I see that you've added option `bigSectionsDestination`, which is great for when I'm scrolling from the bottom of the page to the top. But I really need sections to always load at the top of the section, whether coming from top or bottom, including if the section is big or small.

I have a question. I'm using both fullpage.js and wow.js. It works fine, but on tablet  when the page is longer and you must scroll to see it, it only animates the content that is visible from the beggining and not the one is revealed after the scrolling (actually that content is totally hidden, only when I start browsing the website that page displays the whole content).

Also, I would like to have animation on the inner sliders also, but I guess the onLoad event or something sees that the page was already loaded from the first slide and doesn't do the animation when scrolling inside section.

When you say ""when scrolling inside section."" I guess you talk about scrolloverflow:true, which internally uses iScroll.js as detailed in the documentation.
In that case you should check the [iscroll.js documentaiton](http://iscrolljs.com/) to see if they provide any callbacks or option to achieve your purpose.

I'm trying to use fullPage with somes overflowed sections.
In each of this sections, I would like to fix some divs while user scroll the section by using scrollMagic.js
I make an example here : [http://codepen.io/ramien/pen/akwYKr]
(I don't know why but you have to change the order of scrolloverflow.min.js plugin by put it over fullPage.min.js, when I save my pen, it's not taken into account]

Because fullPage is using iScroll to manage the overflow, fixed elements or not placed in the right place. However scrollMagic can also deals with iScroll by getting the Y position. 
There is an example here :

2128,2016-07-03 13:19:44,"### Description

In my application, I've got a series of sections. These scale to the size of the screen. Inside each of these sections, there's an inner-div, which has a `overflow-y: auto'`.

This means that if there's more content than the box will support, then it will turn into a scroller. However, most of the time, the scrollbar is not visible. 

I'm currently using `normalScrollElements: '.section-main'` to pause when there's a scrollbar. However, this also seems to pause when there's a div with overflow-y: auto. This means that if an end-user has their mouse over this div, and there's no scrollbar, there will be no scrolling action. I understand this behaviour, but they might not.

That's how it is suppose to work in any case. There's no way for fullpage.js to know if you want to use an scrollable element or use normal scroll elements for any other reason. 

You'll have to add a class to elements depending on your needs and add that element in the normalScrollElements. 
In your example, you should only have the class `.section-main` in the element that you want to prevent auto scrolling.

2127,2016-08-20 12:49:11,"Hi Alvaro,

Is it possible to call the afterSlideLoad callback within the afterLoad,
when using fullpage.js?

I need to check which slide the user is on so that if it is the first or
last slide I would be able to hide the prev or next arrow. I managaed to do
this with the afterSlideLoad callback. However when the ection is loaded,
the first slide is not detected thus the arrow will not be hidden. Because
of this I used the afterLoad callback so when the section loads, it will
automatically hide the prev arrow. However if the user goes another slide
and scrolls to another section, when the user scrolls to the slider section
again, the prev arrow will be hidden even if the user is not on the first
slide. This is why I would like to know if it is possible to nest the
callbacks, or if there is any way of doing this

You can do it easier with CSS by using the fp-viewing-X-Y class added to the body element.
If you use the default arrows, just use `loopHorizontal:false` to make the arrows disappear in the 1st and last slides.

This causes another created instance (with the same responsive option) to be non-responsive and thus still having the auto-scrolling active. Is this a bug or intended?
This happens because the `setResponsive` function only disables auto-scrolling if the class is not already present:

Here is the problem:

Let's say that I have set (with matchMedia) for fullpage.js to destroy when the browser viewport is width <800px. 

Then I open a fullpage.js site at width <800px, fullpage.js is destroyed, and I scroll down as normal in between sections but then stop so that in the viewport, say, half of Section 1 is showing and half of Section 2. 

Then I resize my browser upwards, width >800px, same height for example, fullpage.js becomes active, however, the screen is now stuck showing the half of section 1 and 2, or 2 and 3 etc, when translating up and down.

I know this might be a little nitpicky but people could easily resize back and forth and it would be an unpleasant experience. 

Can anyone suggest what I could do to fix this?

Nothing is imposed.

Wrong. You can always use the method `setAutoScrolling(false)`

No need for that trick. Use the class `fp-auto-height-responsive`.
Needs documentation but [its there](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/jquery.fullPage.css#L219) for you to use.

I tried to say that there's nothing that could be used to unbind the height calculation...
As there's the ""responsiveWidth"" parameter to unbind the autoscroll, i was wondering if there's something you can add to unbind even the autoheight event.

> No need for that trick. Use the class fp-auto-height-responsive.

Well, i don't think it's a good idea to use it directly on code... you assigned every ""fp-"" class with plugin, best way is to continue assigning classes with it, don't you agree?
My proposal is to add a parameter as the ""responsiveWidth"" one, to unlock the fixed height and add your class only below the parameter value (i.e. 768px).

Just overide it with CSS:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

You just have to add the class dynamically using javascript or jQuery.

But this way you will only be duplicating CSS code as that's exactly what `fp-auto-height` provides.

> Well, i don't think it's a good idea to use it directly on code... you assigned every ""fp-"" class with plugin, best way is to continue assigning classes with it, don't you agree?

No, I do not agree. That's the whole purpose of that class. It is not used by the library otherwise.
`fp-` classes are just prefixed like so to avoid interference with any external library or developer classes. But they are mean to be used when necessary as stated in the docs.

No, i'm just asking a development request, as you can develop a small update that could help us with this thing... it's not just for me, it's for everybody :) as the ""fp-auto-height"" class needs to be inserted on window resize by me, and not by a small new feature of your plugin.

Window load will always fire after document ready. If you want to remove the scroll bar while the site is loading, you'll have to do it on document ready, not on windows load. And threfore between the `<head>` elements of your site. 

You can do it with CSS or your own javascript.

I am trying to hide certain sections using ""visibility: hidden;"" and with combination of .fp-viewing-1  or .fp-viewing- 2 etc.

This works well -
ex:

<div class=""section"">

it fails if 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I'm getting some weird behavior in combining fullpage.js with owl carousel.

The difference between the two is that in ""index-display"" I've added ""display:block"" to the ""owl-carousel"" container.

In the first one, on desktop and on mobile, the second section gets some extra space at the bottom and if you scroll between sections 2 and 3 the space gets bigger.

In the second one, in mobile mode (desktop, floating browser window) the second section gets stuck at the bottom but if you resize the window just a little bit it updates and shows ok,  while if the browser window is maximized, it works ok.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

First I want to really thank you for making such an amazing library! 

Unfortunately I can't seem to animate my inner divs when the user is within a specific section.
for example, I want to fade in my section's children only when the user has that section within their view. 
Currently they animate immediately when the page loads and by the time i scroll down to that section they have already animated into the view.

I have noticed that your code changes the body's id to `fp-viewing-**sectionClassChangesOnScroll**`   

Because of this I thought I could do this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

However the scroll function does not fire, I am assuming this because the browser views the site as a single page? - (I am not really sure why) 

I was really hoping you could give me some advice as to how I can animate those children.

Thank you very much in advance.

I would suggest getting rid of scrollOverflow as a real responsive site shouldn't need it. 
Using `fp-auto-height` or `fp-auto-height-responsive` seems like a much better option to me together with `responsiveWidth` and `responsiveHeight`.

This way you would turn autoScrolling off and will be able to have sections bigger than the viewport.

Regarding your question, the `resize` event gets called hundreds of times on resize. You'll have to know when to call the function and when not as you won't be able to call the destroy function after you destroy fullpage.js.

But that's more a matter of Javascript knowledge and you should ask those questions in stackoverflow.com.

2079,2016-10-14 20:51:00,"I have run into this issue. I have an idea how to overcome it, but my js skills are not quite there. 

There is a long slide with a vertical timeline. I have my own next/previous horizontal scroll arrows. On the timeline slide, would like to keep the next/prev arrow tabs position:fixed so that they remain centered on screen as the timeline scrolls down, similar to how the bullet navs remain on screen (although they are outside the fullpage div). Those arrow tabs are inside the slide div, inside #fullpage. 

Because div#fullpage gets transform: translate3d(0px, -5060px, 0px); applied dynamically, the position:fixed fails. 

Now, if I put my arrows outside #fullpage and make them display:block when the body acquires the timeline slide's class, they work, however they are positioned at the ""top"" of the stack of slides... i.e., on the cover... relative to the entire height of the body, instead of the viewport. 

If I knew a way to read the current Y coordinate (-5060px in the pasted style above) when we enter that slide, I could maybe build some code into the onSlideLoad or SlideLeave callback that would dynamically set that top measurement to an inline style element on the positioned arrows. 

Does that make any sense? I don't know how to setup a codepen or anything. Anyway, maybe it will spur an idea to help someone else.  
",tduncandesign,2016-06-08 11:08:41
2079,2016-10-15 18:02:45,"Alright, I have figured this out. Caveat, I am a designer, not a programmer, so i really don't know what I am doing, I have cobbled this together from various snippets of js found on stack overflow.

The issue is set out in the OP: position: fixed fails when the fixed element is within a 3d transformed element. FullPage's #fullpage div is such. Per my post above, I wanted fixed previous/next arrows on my long scrolling slide. If I put those arrows within the slide's div, they scroll with the slide. If I set the arrows outside #fullpage div, they will be position fixed, but they appear at the top of the page, on the cover. 

This is how I fixed it. Arrows outside the full page div, but set initially to display none. When the body acquires the slide's class, css tells the arrows to display block. Then they are positioned via javascript on the afterSlideLoad callback. 

If anyone cares to read this and suggest a better way, please do. Otherwise, hope it helps someone else along. Here are my code snippets:

Essentially, calling `$.fn.fullpage.destroy();` on the container at anytime would disable the plugin on that page permanently until refresh. 

The added function `$.fn.fullpage.recreate()`, when called, re-initializes the plugin on the page without the need to reload the page. 

The plugin is reinitialized to having all the default events handled by the plugin bound. During re-initialization, this function also defaults the values of auto scrolling and keyboard scrolling in all directions to true.

Embed Youtube video in page.
Scroll to page - video looks good.
Scroll away from it - Youtube video switches to ""black background"" - controls stays, but Thumbnails disappears.

If You disable autoscroll, then video looks ok.

If you pause youtube videos this way the preview image doesn't disappear: 

var player = new YT.Player(""#selector"");
player.stopVideo();

As mentioned in the docs above you need to include the youtube api script and use a certain function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady

I'm not super sure right now if that makes the video go back to time 0 instead of pause.

The same sometimes occurs on mobile when user tries to scroll the page up/down.

You can reproduce the issue here on your example page: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/normalScroll.html

Reproduction: Drag the scrollbar so that the section's edge is in the middle of the screen (don't release the scrollbar yet), then as soon as the page starts fitting the section to the screen, start dragging the scrollbar again, you'll see the problem. (It's actually easier to see if you set the fitToSectionDelay to 100).

Side note: I tried to detect the scrollbar mousedown by using `e.target !== $('html').get(0)`, but that doesn't work on Mac, so I'm using mousedown on `$(document)` instead.

2051,2016-06-02 10:49:33,"Yeah, it's a tradeoff, but it's still better than having that flickering effect on the website. Besides, I believe that when user clicks on the website while it is scrolling, they actually want it to stop if there's something interesting bump into their eyes so they can see it. I sometimes do that to take a look at some details in the edge of a section when they're about to go pass the middle of the screen.

Maybe we should add it as an option?

If user simply mousedowns on the scrollbar but not dragging, then fitToSection comes into effect, at that point the position of the page is already different from its previous position which is **remembered** by the scrollbar. Well because fitToSection cannot move the scrollbar which is being hold by the mouse. Then when user starts to drag the scrollbar, flickering will occur, because first the page will jump to the previous position which the scrollbar **remembers**, only then it will start to move to the position user drags the scrollbar to.

Call fullpage.js `reBuild` method once the animation finishes.  Fullpage.js needs to know the final position of the elements to see if it needs to create an scrollbar or not. 

Another option is having a container with a set `height` value equals to the resulting one once the animation finished.

I was very pleased to see that slimScroll got replaced by iScroll, but I discovered a bug in combination with my custom js code that was working in previous versions of fullPage:

I created a codepen with the issue:
http://codepen.io/sjaakbanaan/pen/GqgZjK

**The bug:**
Whenever de content in the div that get's shown on click is bigger then the current section, i can't close it anymore and can't open another one.

**How to recreate:**
- use a desktop with a screen > 1680 x 1080 (the preview of the pen needs to be at least 500 px high);
- scroll to the second section and click on the first 'some question' link. No issues whatsoever because the shown content still fits in the section without creating a scrollbar;
- now refresh and open the second 'some question' link. Now a scrollbar gets added and breaks the show/hide functionality completely.

The problem with it is that when you have 40 and more sections, the page load may end up being quite slow even when your website is Grade A and you take advantage of the lazy load.

The problem, according to me, is that there should be a way to reduce DOM elements.
Maybe hiding all the sections that are not active and showing them just when you scroll can be an idea?

That's not a fullpage.js issue but an issue with your very specific scenario. 
You should be using AJAX to load content in that case. You can keep 40 empty sections and you won't suffer from any lag as you can see [here](http://jsfiddle.net/97tbk/1287/).

Using `display:none` won't work. Fullpage.js needs to where where the destination section is.
It seems much easier to solve it from your side.

I am playing about with fullpage.js and while i must say what a great script, i've found an issue which makes it a little unusable.

On mobile devices (IOS) when you scroll down the page and back up, you sometimes get stuck on section 2, I believe it could be the same issue as #1812 & 1814
### Steps to reproduce it
1. Go to www.ukdevelopment.co.uk/test1 on an iOS device using either chrome or safari
2. Scroll down 3 times, scroll up 3 times then repeat,  scroll down 3 times, scroll up 3 times
3. You should be stuck on section 2 which is a slide show, to get to the top you'll need to scroll down then back up again.

2.8.0

Try it using [the dev version fullPage.js 2.8.8](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/dev/jquery.fullPage.js) which solves some click and touch event issues in 2.8.7. Note it is not yet available in the minified version.

Why are you even setting the `click` option? Don't set it at all. FullPage.js sets it to `true` for touch devices and `false` otherwise. Which seems to be the only way it works properly. 
You don't have to worry about it. If you change it, you'll have to deal with the consequences by yourself. Not something fullpage.js will support.

You are not using the vendor file required by fullPage.js when using `scrollOverflow`, which is located in the vendor folder as stated in the docs.
You are instead using `5.2.0/iscroll-infinite.min.js` and fullPage.js might not work as expected with it.

Hi,
I have fullpage.js setup correctly and its all functioning fine and when it hits mobile i have it setup to remove the height so that it turns into a normal scrolling section which is fine. However I have slides inside my sections and if you've scrolled down the content of the  first slide and then navigate to the second the content is nowhere to be seen as it's only a small amount of content so, therefore you have to scroll back up. Is there an existing piece of functionality that dynamically calculates the height of each section so that the height attribute can still be set while the page is a scrolling page to ensure that embedded slides are still vertically centered?

I'd like to customize the URLs for both vertical and horizontal navigation.

we are using fullPage on https://seznam.cz/aplikace and when I switch to ""scroll mode"" (on windows with middle mouse button) and start scrolling, scroll mode ends when url is changed.

I made some tests in jsfiddle and it seems that this only happens in Chrome and when you change hash with `window.location.hash`, when you use`window.history.push/replaceState` it works as expected

System: Window 7

### Proposed solution

use `window.history` API if browser supports it, otherwise fallback to `window.location.hash`

I'm just wondering why I'm getting the error:  ""Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of undefined"".  I have a page (http://www.coffeerepublic.com.au/products/cafina/) that I'm trying to have the ""Enquire"" link go into the product (post), and scroll down to the #enquire (Enquiry form).  When the Enquire link is clicked on the product list page, it does (sort of) scroll down to the proper anchor tag, but it doesn't have a scroll animation, like its supposed to.  I have a bit of script that will automatically animate the scroll from the top of the page to the anchor when a hashed anchor link is clicked.  I tested it on another page that doesn't have Fullpage.js and I'm not getting an error.  It also had the proper scroll animation.

So I guess my question is, how can I have a scroll animation to get to the #enquire element on the page?  I won't be able to use the ""index"" or ""data-anchor"" (at least I don't think?) because the #enquire form isn't always at the same index or section number for every product page.

Anyone have any input?

No, but you can always do it all yourself using javascript.

2015,2016-05-19 18:32:29,"Thanks again, @alvarotrigo for your help :)

Still wondering if there's a way to disable or hide the URL hash changes...?

I'll just add a summary of my solution...  (and here is the page, if anyone is interested in seeing:  http://www.coffeerepublic.com.au/products/cafina/  -  just click on any of the ""Enquire"" buttons to see the anchor working)

Basically, I needed to go through the loop of my ""product detail"" sections that appear above the ""Enquiry"" form section.  While the loop is going, I needed to add an incrementing ""data-anchor"" property to each section.  Once that was incrementing and adding a ""data-anchor=""product-detail-x"" to each one, then I could effectively link to the ""enquiry"" section (data-anchor=""enquiry"").  There was no need for an array of anchors in the ""anchors"" property of the fullpage.js function.

So then because of my floating sticky header, (and the fact that fullpage.js wants to scroll so that the bottom of the anchored section hits the bottom of the viewport) - I needed to add a custom function in the ""afterLoad"" callback:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The enquire section needed a unique ID different than the (data-anchor=""enquiry"") on that section in order for me to run a scrollTop on it.
Also, ""headerHeight"" is obviously a variable that is set higher up - which basically takes a reading on how tall the header is.

I don't know if that will help anyone, but that's what I had to do to get it to work.

Use `lockAnchors` as detailed in the docs.

I thought that meant that it wouldn't auto-scroll, but that anchors would still provide some functionality for other functions.

I just tried using `lockAnchors` and it didn't quite work.  The URL's are gone - however if I click the ""enquire"" anchor link at the top of the page, it doesn't autoscroll to that section. (it does auto scroll when coming from the external page though.)  I might be able to javascript a solution for it to auto scroll on the internal page.

What I ended up doing to reset the animations was in the afterLoad function - use jQuery **clone** to identically duplicate the objects with the class **animated** and then remove / re-append them ( as detailed in this post: [CSS-Tricks: Restart CSS Animation](https://css-tricks.com/restart-css-animation/)

This achieves the desired animation repeat that you're looking for.

Rebuild doesn't do what you expect. Read the docs:

You will have to initialize fullpage.js again after destroying it. Rebuild is only used to deal with scrollOverflow and update the sections and slides dimensiones.

1) Fixed header and footer can have different heights in different breakpoints.
Maybe it would be possible to set responsive queries along with padding bottom and padding top in js - had to use !important in CSS.

2) It would be really helpful to have a possibility to set offset? I mean it would be very user friendly in mobile phones to scroll in next slide little bit. Like in http://projects.lukehaas.me/scrollify/

3) Scrolling inside sections: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/scrolling.html. 
I have slides that are containing lot of content. I had to use scrollOverflow: true.
How is resposniveHeight (resposniveHeight:500 for example) supposed to work with 
scrollOverflow: true? Some pages contain lot of content and because there was not a way to enable

we are encountering an issue when using anchors. Once we set `anchors: [/* anchors here */]` we can scroll to each next slide before the scroll animation stops. That when a user scrolls five ticks on his mousewheel before the animation stops (which happens quickly on os x) the hash in the URL quickly changes 5 times and the page scrolls to slide number 5 and does not stop at the first slide as expected.

We're using fullPage 2.7.8 but most importantly we use `ReactJs` and initialize `fullpage.js` when a component mounts (once, not multiple times), which might be a problem. I cannot reproduce the problem on a plain page, [I tried on JsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/L474qn1n/4/).

Your content is not being chopped as you can see [here](https://fiddle.jshell.net/kemtmm9a/12/). Just the background. As you are using `paddingTop`.
Thus, changing the background solution would solve all your problems.

Section is full height ,but has a padding top, therefore content won' get chopped.

1973,2016-04-18 17:14:09,"I am wondering if it would be possible to add this feature to the already in place lazy loading.

Smart lazy loading would load neighbouring images/slides based on the direction of the user’s movement.

I am thinking this could be achieved by making an array of the slides in a section, detect what slide is currently shown and load the previous two and next two slides immediately from that array but no other images/slides from the array.

Like this when going through the slides a bit faster and using lazy load, users would not have to wait for the current slide to be loaded and would also not see the loading animation of the current slide.

Perhaps the amount of images/slides to be smart lazy loaded could be controlled through an option setting of the smart lazy loading function so that developers can adjust the amount of images to load before and after the current slide.

Currently when using the lazy load in place by fullPage things look like this. The user can actively see the image loading as well as is being told bottom left of browser that the image is loading.
Basically the use is told to wait.

![fullpage lazy loading image 001](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5672418/14613254/dab997c8-059b-11e6-82a6-1b9a444ae552.png)
",monolux,
1973,2016-04-18 17:57:31,"It can be done, but problem is when users access directly to the section/slide by using the navigation or a  menu.
",alvarotrigo,
1973,2016-04-18 18:24:55,"I was thinking of that as well since fullPage provides that functionality, going directly to a section or slide by the URL or navigation. Hence loading the previous and next two slides of that specific URL.

For that use case I guess users will have to wait for the entire site to be loaded as well and that can be done either with a loading animation or some anti-fouc technique, basically showing the user the site is loading and while doing so the neighbouring slides in question are also being loaded.

Would that cause too many HTTP requests? What are your concerns or worries or thoughts about such an approach please? Trying to get more info on such a smart lazy loading approach so if I manage to do this just for slides I will know what to look out for or what to strictly avoid.

Thank you. 
",monolux,
1973,2016-04-18 18:31:09,"No, the problem is, it takes the same time to go from section 2 to section 3 than from section 1 to section 5. 
You are mentioning that currently you can see how the image loads when going from one to another section. Exactly the same would happen if you use a menu and you lazy load images on the adjacent sections, as there's no enough time for the image to be loaded before you get to the section.
",alvarotrigo,
1973,2016-04-18 18:49:39,"I am not sure if I understand you 100%. You talk about the time it takes for fullPage to go from one section to another (1 to 2 or 1 to 5) and that this time is fixed. That I understand.

What about if I only fire such a smart lazy load function once fullPage has reached the section the users wants to go to either through URL or navigation? I am more thinking about once fullPage has reached a section with slides such a function could be called. So this would be for slides excursively basically.

Users will most likely be occupied with taking in the information that is being displayed before they have the urge to go to the next slide. While they are occupied with that the smart lazy load function could grab the adjacent slides from both directions. As far as I know slides can be scrolled left or right, but not up or down, right?

Example:
User loads this link. website.com/#photos/#**slide13**
Once fullPage has come to that section **and** to that slide **and** is finished with the ""travelling animation"" the smart lazy load function kicks in and grabs slides 11, 12, 14 and 15 respectively.

Now if the user goes to website.com/#photos/#**slide14** slide 14 is already loaded.
If the user goes to website.com/#photos/#slide12 the slide 12 is also already loaded.

And naturally being either on website.com/#photos/#slide14 or website.com/#photos/#slide12 slides 10 or 15 would be grabbed by the smart lazy load function.

Does that make sense?

(I think I read somewhere in the documentation that the ""travelling animation"" can also be turned off, meaning when loading a URL fullPage displays the content of that URL directly without the animation of going through the sections and slides, what is this option again please if it exists?)

1973,2016-04-18 20:09:00,"Regarding ""travelling animation"" I have found it again!

> animateAnchor: (default true) Defines whether the load of the site when given an anchor (#) will scroll with animation to its destination or will directly load on the given section.

As far as I know reducing the amount of HTTP requests boots search engine ranking (don't quote me on that!), that is really the reason I am trying to add this functionality to fullPage. (PhotoSwipe.com has this and it works great even when going through the slides/photos really fast.)

Do you think, while I wait for the next version or this enhancement this to happen, such an enhancement can be added by myself through an external function without touching the fullPage source?

Or is fullPage at the moment how it is too restrictive to actually accept something like that? I feel like I like to give it a try and see how far I get. Making an array of slide objects, checking current slide and loading adjacent slides would not really have to touch core fullPage functionality, would it?

Or am I understanding this completely wrong and I will indeed need to go into the source and change things there?

i am currently trying to get fullpage working on mobile devices, therefore i used the `responsiveWidth` property and hoped that it will solve my problem.

But actually it does some strange things depending on the browser.

I have some containers which are not fitting the viewpoint on mobile. If the `responsiveWidth` property is set the containers are all set to the same size (altough they would need different sizes as there is a different amount of content in them) causing them to overlap, which is a mess. Scroll down to see the first container behind the next ones overlapping.

On firefox you can see it instantly on chrome i had to resize the browser window to see it.

[CodePen](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/dMewzY)

Another thing i noticed: If i put an element in the first container with a margin (e.g. `<h1>`) the whole fullpage container gets an offset. In the codepen try setting the border to 0 as the border alters the behaviour. No idea why acutally

If we are talking about the 2nd case, then we can create a new class for the navigation elements. Otherwise then you will have to wait for fullpage.js v3 for that. Changing the ""active"" class applied to sections and slides is a major change that can break many websites using fullpage.js.

1959,2016-04-10 08:20:44,"Hello,

First of all I have to thank everyone involved in making this amazing piece of work! Now to my issues...

I am trying to build my online portfolio, which in itself is a long battle and struggle. jQuery is not my strong side, which is why I came to you for guidance. I have stumbled upon some issues, in which I would like to get some clarification and I hope you will at some point find the time to reply. :)

**My first issue is:**
I run fullpage on my homepage and have a few cases displayed within it, and it looks great. I have added a little jQuery in order to create a lightbox/popup div, and within it I display my cases. And this is where issue 1 comes in.

In the case div it is scrollable, which means the fullpage div is running in the background and scrolling while the case div is open. I would love to know how and if you could disable the scrolling within fullpage by simply add/removeClass somehow? That could potentially fix my issue 1. Would be the perfect solution if a class could be added to disable/enable the scroll.

**Second issue**
I have tried to research quite a bit into this issue. I would love to run fullpage twice on my website (onepage website). I have also looked into alternatives where I replace one of the instances with another carousel or other solutions, but I would prefer to use fullpage.js only, because I like the entire functionality much better compared to others I have researched (which is A LOT).

1 x On the homepage.
1 x On the homepage, but within lightbox/popup div. (Which displays on click).

So basically on the same page, just one is displayed at the very beginning and one is hidden within a div, which becomes visible like a lightbox. I can easily get one to work, either on landing or within the lightbox div. The issue I have, is that, if I run both at the same time, it totally bugs up.

I have read several posts and topics asking this question, on other forums also, but it does not seem like anyone has been able to find a solution for it. I know the script is built for one instance, but it seems like I am not alone in wanting to run it multiple times.

_I hope you will be able and find the time to answer my two questions. Once again amazing piece of work you have done!_

Best regards, Morten.

Use the option `normalScrollElements` or if you prefer, the function `setAllowScrolling(false)` when opening the dialog.

> 1 x On the homepage, but within lightbox/popup div. (Which displays on click).

You can try it by making use of an iframe. But fullpage.js doesn't provide any option to create multiple instances of it at the moment, and less yet one over another.

For our use case we have a section with slides, and we have some normal scroll elements in some of the slides which take up most of the screen. ([example](http://www.codestar.nl/#team/galleryA))

This works as expected for vertical scrolling, but also disables horizontal scrolling. On desktop browsers this is acceptable (keyboards and arrow navigation still works), but prevent swiping on mobile unless you start the swipe from outside of the normal scroll element. This is a problem if the normal scroll element takes up most of the screen.

It would be awesome if you independently could enable normal scrolling on the x or y axis.

It would be nice to have an option to activate a sort of ""continue scrolling"". Normally, with mouse wheel, the pages scroll vertically, but it would be nice to have the same gesture to scroll horizontal slides as well, and then keep scrolling vertically when you reach the last slide.

See this example: three pages, the second with 3 slides:
1
2.1 2.2 2.3
3

You just keep scrolling the mousewheel down and you'll go thru this sequence:

1 2.1 2.2 2.3 3

 I was able to use fullpage.js and particles.js flawlessly together. If you don't know, particles.js is a lightweight particles library that can give your site a kind of molecule affect. 

Now, I believe my problem is associated with the table cell layout. As I view it on mobile, the table cell goes to incredible heights, especially on my 1440p phone. This did not happen before without fullpage.js. Is there anyway I can completely disable the table-cell so that the height is fixed and it does not scale to whatever resolution the screen is? 

My site is [here](http://tsa.johnkorhel.com/). You'll notice that the site works the way I want it to when just scaling the site, but when you go into the responsive test in inspect element, it basically zooms out the site on most mobile devices.

1928,2016-03-26 18:39:35,"See [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/36061842/1081396)

I'll quote myself:

I always recommend people to use load fullPage.js in the header contrary to the popular trend which adds JS files in the body.

**Why?**
Because I consider fullPage.js is essential for the correct visualization of your site. Without fullpage.js, your sections won't be of the correct size, they will be overlapping as you mention, slides content will be visible when it shouldn't...

Some of those things require of fullpage.js to run, detect dimensions of your content, set the slides to the right position etc.

You can check this in any of [the demo pages](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) provided by fullPage.js and you'll see there's no such blink. 

**If you still don't want to go for this solution to speed up the loading of your site.**, what I would recommend is to use the critical CSS technique to set the size of your sections as fast as possible (even when fullpage.js is not initialized yet) and without any HTTP request (to speed it up even more)

Use the following inline styling in the header of your site:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This will solve the problem with the blinking sections.

**Some of the possible problems**
- If you are using a conditional initialization of fullpage.js, this will still be applied even when you don't need it.
- If you destroy fullpage.js dynamically, this will still be applied when you don't need it.
- Sections with bigger content than the viewport won't have scroll bar until the plugin is loaded and initialized. 
- Slides will be accessible for the user even when you don't want it by using `setAllowScrolling(false)` in some slides.

first of all, thank you and compliments for this plugin. 

This is just a question, since I am a bit confused about the build/destroy usage in my situation.
In my app I am adding new sections to the fullpage container progressively, it happens when you reach the last section: something like an infinite scroll, only a few section are loaded at start.

The problem is that I can't load and let the user stay where he is:
- if I destroy and reinstantiate the navigation starts again from the first section
- if I rebuild nothing happens (but maybe I simply misunderstood its usage)

Here is a fiddle:
http://jsfiddle.net/9L108quo/

So if I add a few sections the only possibility is to destroy and rebuild from scratch, losing your position. Is there an alternative? Or should I add an 'active' class to the last seen section before destroning and reinstantiate?

Thank you very much.

The app is a personal thing still in development, in case you're interested a draft is here:
[fdf.xho.bedita.net](http://fdf.xho.bedita.net/)
(it is in Italian, sorry, but the usage is quite intuitive)
You should have 10/15 sections loaded at start and then a progressive load when you reach the bottom.

I think it would be better from a user experience point of view to have the controls for scrolling the sections up or down **not** to scroll with the sections.

Meaning the controls should stay fixed at the top or bottom, left or right, while the section changes.

I was trying to do just that and use a fixed element for navigation while not hiding content under that fixed element that is taken from the document flow through its fixed property. So I have come up with [a solution](https://jsfiddle.net/gvsasrnw/), though it is just a draft really, nothing more, you could surly improve on it. But it shows you what I mean regarding having the gallery controls (arrows in your case) at a fixed place.

I'm stuck and can't find the error myself... I have problems with the first section. It's visible when the page first loads, but after scrolling down to other sections I can't scroll back to 1st section. I'm using loopBottom and the first section isn't shown then either (when it goes back to the top). The url is showing the anchors correctly, so it's ""domain.com.../#section-1"" even if the section isn't visible.

Any tips or tricks..? I would be SO grateful!

1922,2016-03-23 23:49:47,"Hi. I'm building a portfolio site. I want 3 sections that scroll vertically. Section 1 will have a slider with numerous slides showing art projects. Section 1, slide 1 will contain a bunch of thumbnails with links for all the art projects, and when you click on one of the thumbs, you will scroll to the corresponding slider page for that project.

The normal behavior for fullpage is to scroll past all of the slides and stop on the target slide. What I would like to do is scroll to the target slide directly. For example, let's say you click on thumbnail 25 on the first slide. Normal behavior is to scroll to the right and past 24 slides and stop on slide 25. I would like it to scroll right but for only one slide. I know you can do this be disabling animations, but I want to keep the animation, just have it appear that the target slide is always only one slide away.

Is this possible? I've gone through all the documentation and the issues/requests, and I can't see how it might be done. If not currently possible, could the feature be added to fullpage at some point? Thanks in advance!

1921,2016-03-23 12:42:11,"See your callbacks example: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/callbacks.html

If you are moving to section two which includes slides only the afterLoad callback is fired, but not the afterSlideLoad which should be fired also, because you are going to a slide.

Usage example: if you change e.g. fixed header styles depending on sections and(!) slides background, you would like to use the afterLoad and/or afterSlideLoad callbacks to identify the current loaded slide to change the header style. That works for slides when you change them (moving left or right) but not if you are landing on a slide via a section change (moving up or down).

afterSlideLoad should be fired whenever a slide is loaded, even if you change to a section that contains slides.

I'll copy it here:

**You can't do that**. Fullpagejs will only expect sections between sections.

What you can do instead is playing with fullpage.js options. Use them as sections, use the `fp-auto-height` class for them so they won't be full screen, and use some callback to force fullpage.js to jump them when you are about to arrive to them:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I've coded this script in a way that you just need to use the class `ignore` in your section to force fullpage.js to ignore it, for example:

1919,2016-09-01 09:42:08,"> is there any conflict if combine Responsive Slide + Continuous Horizontal Scroll + Scroll Horizontally ?

Well, I don't really know what you expect, but there's some kind of conflict between continuousHorizontal and scrollHorizontally.
If you use continuousHorizontal you expect to always scroll back to the 1st slide of the slider when sliding right on the last slide.
But if you also use scrollHorizontally to be able to slide with the mouse wheel, this would create a loop from which you would never be able to escape.

So in this case, what fullpage.js does is scroll DOWN to the next section **when using the mouse wheel** on the last slide instead of sliding back to the 1st slide.
This way there won't be a loop when using the mouse wheel. 

But, on the other hand, when using the arrows in the slider or the keyboard to slide right on the last slide, **it will slide back to the 1st slide** using the continuous horizontal extension. 

It shouldn't be any problem with the responsiveSlides one.

I [uploaded a demo for you](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/3.html) of those 3 extensions together so you can see it in action.

I'm trying to use fullpage.js in a Angular App. For do that, I have to disable the routing of Angular, and fullpage.js seems to works correctly. The problem is when I go to a concrete section (anchor) throw URL. It goes to first section instead the section defined in url.

It occurs when I use the ng-include directive of Angular. This directive includes the content of a HTML file inside a element. Here is the code of index file and included file:

**index.html**
`<body>
    <div ng-include=""'content.html'""></div>
<body>`

**content.html**
`<div class=""full-page"">

    <div data-anchor=""section3"">Section 3</div>
    <div data-anchor=""section4"">Section 4</div>
</div>`

I read other threads and I noticed that there used to be a scrollDelay var which currently doesn't exist. Is there any way to keep scrollingSpeed at 0 and add a delay inside the section so that the user is forced to stay in each section for 1500ms? 

I think that those two should be two different things and scrollingSpeed should define only the transition of the section and not the actual stay inside the section.

what do you think?

http://www.alexioslizos.com/#contact

On mobile ONLY (have checked chrome, firefox, opera on android 6.0.1) Whenever i try to tap the input field, it focuses for some milliseconds, and instantly unfocuses. 

This is the javascript initialization code for fullpage:

$('#fullpage').fullpage({
        sectionsColor: ['transparent', 'transparent', 'transparent', 'transparent', 'transparent'],
        anchors: ['home', 'bio', 'ensembles', 'calendar', 'recitals', 'teaching', 'contact'],
        menu: '#menu',
        scrollingSpeed: 1000,

        navigation: true,
        scrollingSpeed: 600,
        responsive: 100,
        css3: true,
        slidesNavigation: true
    });

I believe that this is because the site detects a change in height, causes a resize - redraw, and that takes away the focus from the input fields. How could I fix it? Can we somehow on touchstart disable the resize event so that it does not trigger a redraw?

I haven't found a solution by myself. fullpage version is 2.7.4.

by using setAllowScrolling i disabled the scroll left and right, this because I need to avoid the horizontal gesture (swipe) on a device with touchscreen.
Due to this, I enabled the controlArrow in order to allow by clicking them the scrolling through the slides in horizontal.
Now the issue is that if I disable the left,right scroll the click on control arrows does not work.

I also tried by catching the event onSlideLeave but there is no way to understand if the scrolling has been made by keyboard or click instead of gesture...

Is there a way to let the cotrol arrows scroll right - left but disable only gestures?

That's something that has to be improved and make more consistent. 
But right now, the solution is to assign the methods `moveSlideRight` or `moveSlideLeft` to the arrows by yourself.

Right now `setAllowScrolling` will disable the touch and mouse scrolling. But:
- It won't disable `moveSectionUp`, `moveSectionDown`, `moveSlideRight` or `moveSlideLeft` functions.
- It **will** disable the click event on the arrows.

The plugin doesn't provide such option.
You'll have to create the menu by yourself by using the plugin function `moveTo` and activate or desactivate the menu elements by using callbacks such as `onLeave` or `afterLoad`.

I have a a website that has two different flows depending on if a person is the first user creating a ""team"", or subsequent users joining that ""team"". For purposes of clarity, I will call them ""captain"" and ""member"". 

For both flow's I am using fullpage.js on their ""index"" pages.

The captain's flow url is as follows: `http://www.website.com/` and when it pages it works like `http://www.website.com/#anchor`
It works great in the captain's flow, and as expected.

In the member's flow, the url is as follows `http://www.website.com/invite-code/someinvitecode==` where `someinvitecode` represents a series of letters and numbers, and has the == at the end as it is an encoded GUID. When I scroll through the anchors here I get `http://www.website.com/invite-code/someinvitecode==#/anchor` and if I try reworking it to be `http://www.website.com/invite-code/someinvitecode==/#anchor` it corrects to `http://www.website.com/invite-code/someinvitecode==/#/anchor`

That doesn't make much sense.
Fullpage.js only add `/` when you are using sections anchors AND slide anchors. ([see code](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/jquery.fullPage.js#L2234))
In your case, that seems to be an slide anchor and **an empty section anchor**.

The anchor **should** be a section anchor.. but for some reason it is acting as a slide anchor, according to your js link you sent. I am unsure why it is doing this? I have copied my mark up into a jsfiddle and it works as expected.. scrolling between sections. I am going to try reducing my mark up down, and it appears that it either has to do with my project url in this case, or it is in conflict with the other fullpage() function I have in another file? Is this something that you have seen before? I cannot send the link for the project directly under NDA, but I can try to create a github.io with a reduced markdown so you can fiddle with it as jsfiddle produces it correctly.

Nop, first time.

A reproduction in jsfiddle or codepen would be ideal.
But as I said, it seems that somehow your section anchor is being omitted. Can you inspect your page DOM structure and find the `data-anchor` attribute in the section?

1893,2016-03-09 16:11:33,"I have solved this issue! I was becoming increasingly frustrated because when I put my mark up into the JSFiddle, it worked exactly as it should.. so I copied that code into my project and it no longer worked again!

Turns out, I likely had some invisible characters from when I was copy/pasting in my JS file for the controller I am using on this page in Angular. I debugged it down to a $http declaration in my controller to be the issue, and once I removed it, and readded it, the entire page worked as the captain's flow.

Thanks a lot, love the library. Once the project goes live I will be sure to send you a follow up.

1876,2016-03-03 12:10:42,"Hi all, 

Here is something I'm trying to do when using **fullPage.js _with_ scroll inside section**:
1. add a kind of “sticky"" element
2. this element must have an absolute position when within a section, so that if it is very long (higher than your viewport), one can see the rest of it when scrolling within section
3. this element must slide to the next section whenever you scroll to another section
4. after sliding to another section, this element must come back to an absolute position like mentioned in step 2
#### So I did this step by step

1st implementation: scrollable sections & fixed element http://jsfiddle.net/AdrienBe/rjxfejgd/
2nd implementation: scrollable section & repeatable element in it http://jsfiddle.net/AdrienBe/7f2qpwvd/
3rd implementation: scrollable sections & sticky element (beta 1) https://jsfiddle.net/AdrienBe/f6f2nhch/

As you can see, the 3rd implementation works nicely when you are ""from up to down"" between sections. But it's kind of buggy when scrolling ""from down to up"".

Anyone would know how to improve this? I feel I may have a breakthrough myself but I'm guessing someone might already have implemented this :)

Thanks in advance

**Another approach** could be to force the section to go to the top of the next section when scrolling ""from bottom to up"". This way I believe the 3rd implementation could be left ""as is"" & work.

I have six sections on my site, however, I need to maintain a set amount of navigation dots. Basically, I need to be able to scroll from section 4 to section 5, but I don't want section 5 to have a nav dot. Is there any way to have a section without a corresponding dot?

Question 2 (apologies for the double ask:(..); I have a section that should only be visible based on an option selected by the user. So if the user selects this button, they will scroll down to this section. If they do not choose this option, they should scroll down to another section. I've tried adding a class of ""section"" via a click handler, also tried the old display:none/display:block way, but every time I try something like that, the page just won't scroll past the section and gets hung up.

While resizing my device fullPage.js creates its another structure instead of changing current one (or delete and create new). This produces a lot of needless code.

1859,2016-02-28 17:19:39,"When you open a site directly in a section (as specified in the URL, e.g. #4thpage) then Fullpage scrolls to that section once the site is loaded.

It waits until everything is loaded, including all elements and startup scripts, and then it scrolls to the right section.

You can see this for example if you open a Fullpage site like this:
http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#4thpage
As requested in the URL it needs to open in the fourth section (scroll to that section on site open).

But when there is a delaying startup script in your document, you might want Fullpage to firstly scroll to the right section and then finish loading of the delaying script (such as a chat box that is starting up).

For example in my case I have a chat box which is just an extra support feature to help people who have trouble on the site or who want to ask a question about what they see on the site. In that case it's more important that all main parts of the site are loaded and Fullpage has scrolled to the right section. After that I would like to startup my chat box script.

If you could add a feature to specify a script or element so that Fullpage will not wait for it on startup, and scrolls to the section directly, that would be much appreciated. On that way these scripts or elements are not delaying the page anymore.

As the maker of Fullpage.js (@alvarotrigo) explained [on another place](http://stackoverflow.com/a/35653296/1081396):

> Probably what's taking time is the loading of the JS, CSS or SWF files required for that script to run. Fullpage.js waits until all elements from the site have loaded to scroll to the section. The reason to do this is due to the use of images in section when using scrollOverflow:true, as fullpage.js needs to determine if the section needs scroll bar or not depending on the size of the loaded image.

fullPage.js will animate to the top if you come from a section above the destination one.

Make sure you use the latest fullpage.js (2.7.8) to get this result.

From a user point of view i would expect animate to top if coming from a section below the destination one. the thing is that the same link navigates me to two different positions. so if i want to go again to beginning of the previous section (like it worked before from above) I get a different behaviour now.

An option for this would be really cool therefore. imho the same link should always lead to same position. in this case top of section.

Hi,

I noticed that in normal scroll mode, when in the first section, a slide has a scroll overflow, the scroll is not triggered until you display this particular slide. Did not find where it comes from.

Take a look at the `fullPage/examples/normalScroll.html` in the attached zip to see it.

Julien

Is it possible to instantly move on scroll only between some sections?

I need to have ""section1"", ""section2"" and ""section3"" to scroll without animation (to just jump from one to the other) and to have all the other sections animating normally.

I know there is the $.fn.fullpage.silentMoveTo('anchor-link', 'slide'); function and I am trying to use it in this way but it doesn't work:

is there a possibility to fade in the first section from bottom? See here for this behaviour: http://facultydept.com/

The first section comes into the viewport like the normal section scrolling in fullpage. An invisible section ""zero"" shows a logo and disappears when the page finished loading. This animation help people to recognize the function of fullpage and might be a nice design feature.

How can this behaviour be achieved by fullpage?

Actually I would like to add animate.css animation in my caption text in my slider. So the method you have in DOCS.

onLeave: function(index, nextIndex, direction){$('.mycaption').removeClass('animated fadeInUp');},
afterLoad: function(anchorLink, index){$('.mycaption').addClass('animated fadeInUp');},
afterRender: function(){$('.mycaption').addClass('animated fadeInUp');},

I was trying to add these classes into my caption text however these methods only applies after slide loaded but I want when slide comes up or goes down. I meant to say in progressive way.

I hope it makes sense .

I tried your method it is good for bounce animation. I want fadeInUp and fadeOutUp effect. I am making a slider with this I have caption on left side I want to fadeInUp on wayin and fadeOutUp on wayout.

Your method applies only when section loaded. I want when slide comes in progressive way.

You'd better ask somewhere else, yours is definitely not a fullpage.js issue.

1834,2016-02-18 00:49:14,"Thanks for your quick response.

Actually I would like to add animate.css animation in my caption text in my slider. So the method you have in DOCS.

onLeave: function(index, nextIndex, direction){$('.mycaption').removeClass('animated fadeInUp');},
afterLoad: function(anchorLink, index){$('.mycaption').addClass('animated fadeInUp');},
afterRender: function(){$('.mycaption').addClass('animated fadeInUp');},

I was trying to add these classes into my caption text however these methods only applies after slide loaded but I want when slide comes up or goes down. I meant to say in progressive way.

I hope it makes sense .

You are only initializing fullpage.js if the width resolution is larger than 1204px. But you said you have the problem width smaller resolutions, which makes total sense, the plugin was not initialized, you can not call a function that doesn't exist. 

My recommendation is to check if the plugin was initialized by using one of the [**state classes**](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#state-classes-added-by-fullpagejs) added by fullpage.js: `fp-enabled`.

http://newageironworks.net/

In that sample, on mobile you see how not everything fits in mobile, so they add an inner scroll inside some sections, and then auto scroll to the next section when it is finished. How can I do this?

Also, similar question, is there any way to make something like http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/oneSection.html but with auto scroll only on the first section? 

Thank you, great script

> scrollOverflow: (default false) defines whether or not to create a scroll for the section in case its content is bigger than the height of it. When set to true, your content will be wrapped by the plugin. Consider using delegation or load your other scripts in the afterRender callback. In case of setting it to true, it requires the vendor plugin jquery.slimscroll.min and it should be loaded before the fullPage.js plugin. For example:

You can try using a new option which haven't been yet tested: `hybrid:true` in combination with the addition of the class `fp-normal-scroll`in the sections you want to have normal scrolling.

This is our site: www.mogtaller.com it is built on wordpress and we integrated the fullPage.js it works perfectly. 
The issue is the following: Right now you can only navigate between slides only to the right, if you clic left it has a carousel effect that takes you through the whole 3 slides. We would like for users to navigate either left or right without having to go through all of the slides. 

Hope we were clear, please see attached image for a visual representation of what we are looking to achieve.

So on vertical scrolling you should arrive to the first slide then click left go to the second click right and go back to the first slide, click right again and go to the 3d slide.

So, everytime the page is reloaded, all sections start with an insanelly big height (like, 2000px or more). None of my sections have any content with this size. This happens in all devices.

If I correctly understood the plugin's behavior, sections should fit the screen's height or, if their content are bigger than screen, its height should fit the content (and then you should use the scrollOverflow, to scroll through content).

Well, I tried to uncomment the `autoScrolling` and `scrollOverflow` lines and weird stuff happened: some sections stayed too big, others were sized to it's content height (and not the screen's height) and so on...

Any ideias? By the way, great plugin.

**Important note:** I'm not touching in any html, body or section's height.
**Important note 2:** when the window is resized, the sections are correctly resized. By that, I guess we're not dealling with a bug, but a developer (me) not properly knowing how to use the plugin. If this question should be asked in Stack Overflow, sorry for that.

I have three sections. My second section has more content then the height of the viewport. Section 1 and 3 have less content and have the same height as the viewport.

When I navigate from section 1 to section 2 (from the linked navigation menu), it scrolls till the BOTTOM of section 2 hits the BOTTOM of my screen. How can I let it stop scrolling when the TOP of section 2 hits the TOP of my screen??? I of course want my visiter to start reading at the top of section 2.

I haven't merged it yet, but there's a possible solution there. 

> Especially on small devices it takes a lot of space to keep them always visible.

There's no way to decide whether to ""keep them visible"" or not. That's just the way each browser deals with it. The only way you can make the browser navigation bars to work in their usual way is when you use `autoScrolling:false` (or the responsive options firing it) or `scrollBar:true`.

",alvarotrigo,
1793,2016-01-26 11:27:10,"ok... sad but obviously true ;) Correct me if I`m wrong.. the iOS minimal-ui is not forced because you fetch all the scrolling events so the browser did actually not know that there is a scrolling event, right? If there is no scrolling event for the browser, the minimal-ui is not working though, right? Is it possible to passthrough the scrolling event but keeping the autoScroll behavior?

",VIEWSION,
1793,2016-01-26 11:34:25,"I don't know what is the `minimal-ui` thing you are talking about.

That's not correct. The `scroll` event is being fired at [line 865](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/jquery.fullPage.js#L865). The `preventDefault` only prevents the normal scrolling of the site, the equivalent to the mousewheel / scrolling bar.

We are developing a website using your JS. (see here http://kemdu.lt/mangali/)

Not without a scrollbar.

This is a question for anyone who might know why the following is happening. So when viewing a site I'm building (davidsiglinphotography.com) on mobile (IOS & Android) - if I change the phone orientation a few times the site will reorient down a section. Sometimes it will reorient and be at the bottom section. So, looking at section 2, I rotate between portrait and landscape a few times and end up in section 3.

Any idea why this is happening? On a normal site this wouldn't be a big deal since rotating the device wouldn't happen much. However on the site I'm building the phone is rotated to depending on a landscape or portrait photo.

I tried to recreate the problem with the fullpage.js test site but I can't make it misbehave so this is most likely a problem I introduced somehow. Just curious if anyone knows how I can fix it. Thanks.

1758,2016-01-09 20:34:24,"Hi Alvaro,
I'm using a fixed header on my site with a paddingTop option for the sections, but this option adds a padding between sections instead of subtracting the height of my fixed header from the height of the sections, so I get a gap between my sections when scrolling the page down.

Here's what it looks like: https://jsfiddle.net/ya_kareshka/k8puc0tb/ (just scroll down).

The paddingTop option works now like this (in my case):
![current](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10310866/12217787/23273d9a-b71c-11e5-8011-07ca14997d7c.png)
It doesn't decrease the height of the whole section, but it adds a top padding for the content inside of each section.

Why not get rid of top padding for each section content and just make the height of each section to fit the space under the fixed header?

This is what it would look like: 
![another](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10310866/12217891/b62d84c0-b71f-11e5-89f5-6372d15b84c0.png)
Instead of adding paddin-tops for each section we just add a margin-top for the whole fullpage-wrapper (once) and derease the height of sections by the value of the paddingTop option.

Just take a look, no gaps between the sections:

Create your own arrow elements with CSS or images or whatever.

Then assign to them the `$.fn.fullpage.moveSectionDown()` and `$.fn.fullpage.moveSectionUp()` events provided by fullpage.js.

If you don't know how to apply the events, just check one of the many demos online provided [in the documentation](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js) which assign functions to buttons.

1754,2016-01-06 22:50:59,"My fault. The setAllowScrolling has no effect on any translate value, you are right. 
What I meant with translateZ is the last value of translate3d. A setting of 0 is a setting (default is none). So hardware acceleration is activated, which is good during animations.

But I noticed the behaviour of position: fixed realigning occurs in all forms of transform properties. I just wondering if transform could be replaced with something different as long there is no animation happening which have to be accelerated, e.g. using top or a minus margin. That would solve any fixed position problem.

By now when I want to open a overlay modal in a section, I have to get the translate3d value of the fullpage.js wrapper, parse out the Y axis and put it on my fixed element e.g. a overlay. This works, but is a bit complex and maybe there could be a better solution.

1754,2016-01-07 11:21:29,"> Why are you using a fixed positioned element? Why don't you just use an absoluted positioned one?

Quite a good point. And it will work, but IMHO not fully progressive enhanced. If fullpage.js isn't initialise correctly, my overlay modals will also not show up as full page modals because they are positioned absolute and not fixed. The difference is clearly that with position fixed I can stick to bottom: 0 and top: 0 values while the position: absolute needs a container with height: 100% or a fixed pixel to height to work like this. And I have to ensure that there is no position value of absolute or relative in any parent except the wrapper.

Or would you code a fullpage overlay with absolute position in any case?

> fullpage.js works with translate3d if you want hardware acceleration. There's no way to remove it if you want css3 animations.

Not sure my suggestion from my seconds post is a good solution, but I think the css transform is only needed during scrolling to get smooth experience via hardware acceleration. If the page isn't scrolled, wouldn't it be possible to set the position of the wrapper via margins and as soon scrolling occurs, replace it with transforms, then when scrolling ends, go back to margins? That sounds like a hack and want to know what possibly could go wrong.

You can't chage from transform to `margin` or `top` without a flicker. Plus it is just making things more complex when there's no need for it.

I have to check how Velocity.js did its scroll handling because I hadn't these problems before. But I couldn't handle the periphery input correctly in my solution, that's why I changed to fullpage.js.

1752,2016-01-06 10:25:06,"Under normal scroll (`autoScrolling: false`), when a section is longer than the window height, the active flag in navigation can be wrong. This PR fixes this issue.

The current logic (in the base fork) calculates the difference between the `section.offsetTop` and `$window.scrollTop()` for each section and pick the one with the smallest diff as active. However, this can be wrong. For example, suppose there are two sections A and B, where section A is much longer than the window height. Consider the case when you have _just_ scrolled B entering the viewport. At this point, section B occupies very little area of the window, whereas section A still dominates. However, `diff(A.offsetTop, window.ScrollTop) < diff(B.offsetTop , window.ScrollTop)` as A is very long and the top of B is much closer to the window scrollTop. This will select section B as the current active section _wrongly_.

To fix this issue, I changed the logic to explicitly find _which section passes the middle line of the screen_. This will work correctly for the scenario above, where the top of section B obviously does not pass the middle line. 

Corner cases:
- If section B is short and there is a section C coming, selecting section B as active when it passes the middle line is still acceptable because it is the section at the screen center (which is the center of attention).
- In the case of `autoScrolling: true`, my modification works as well. So there is no negative side-effect.

To do so you would have to change in line 813 this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

For this

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Otherwise sections with `fp-auto-height` wont get active (and the menu). You can test it by using the `normalScroll.html` example file and adding the `fp-auto-height` to the 2nd section.

We still have troubles when using `scrollBar:true` in this cases, as you can scroll to the 2nd section but this won't pass the middle of the screen. Although I believe that's for another PR.

1751,2016-01-06 09:58:46,"Hi,

I have uploaded an example of my site here http://scottmoselen.com/tests/brow101-full/#service_menu

Most of the sections on my site are larger than 100% height of the section, and I have auto scrolling:false set. When I scroll past the first section (where the content fits inside 100% height, the anchor link in the url bar changes at the correct time — half way between the sections (from #home   to #about).

However, after I scroll through the section where the content is bigger than the height of the section (from #about to #service_menu), the anchor link in the url changes too early. If scrolled slowly you will see if doesn't change half way between the sections, more like when only 1/4 of the next section is shown.

This problem occurs all the way down the site, as the user scrolls past the sections. I have experimented with adding an section where the content doesn't flow outside of the section, and that works fine. I have also experimented with removing all padding/margins etc on the content to see if it would have an effect, with no luck. I don't want to use slim scroll to have the user scroll within the section, I just want them to be be to scroll down the page naturally. 

I just wanted to know if there was a work around for this problem, as I need the anchor links in the url to change at the correct time.

I work with fullpage.js in combination with wow.js. The only way i can achieve this is to set the ""scrollbar: true"".

The normal approach nowadays is to determine it by the `width` and `height` of the device. But it won´t assure you its a mobile or a tablet.

In any case, this is not something fullpage.js can deal with, you will have to distinguish between one or another device by yourself and then initialise the plugin in one or another way.

Devices tested on:
Nexus 7 running Lolipop and stock  browser
Moto X (1st gen) running KitKat and stock browser

Initial page load:
![fullpage1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7239446/12028426/2f46b7e8-ada5-11e5-8cda-8ce834e48175.jpg)

If I scroll down enough for address bar to disappear, wait for ""fitToSection"" to fire and and this is what I get.
![fullpage2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7239446/12028431/34c0436a-ada5-11e5-9c24-f86ab4124295.jpg)

Scrolling down to the final (third) section you can see how the failure to resize effects the site (sorry for the volume indicator):
![fullpage3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7239446/12028433/3c1c9f64-ada5-11e5-8821-726494140137.jpg)

Now, when I rotate the phone to landscape and then rotate back to portrait the resize command fires and the section is the right size.
![fullpage4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7239446/12028437/4dd6b604-ada5-11e5-9268-1e98d6c14909.jpg)

So, that is the issue. What is a good work around so that the section height and width is checked when the height and width change or is there a more elegant solution? I don't know javascript enough to code a custom solution.

with chrome and firefox on pc no problem.
with internet explorer and safari a lot.

with safari: 
if i use the click on the mouse on the arrow on the first page, it look fine in the other.
otherwise, if i use the keyboard to scroll, in the next pages, the video overlap the div with the content.
( the z-index are correct)

with ie (and also mobile) the pages are not resize well and i don't see al the content.
the scroll il fine but the page is cut and i don't see the arrow to scroll.

also the video, even if is very small, is not loaded well. it seems like it's like 20gb of weight.
big. too big. and it's not.

is there maybe an hack for those browsers that i have to put?

Is it possible to have different section heights, but at least 100% ?
For example i want all the sections to be at least 100% height, but if the content of a section is bigger than 100% height i want to be able to scroll (that section).
Also is it possible to remove the scroll to section event when scrolling ? I don't mind if i click on navigation dots or menu links.

Thanks !

You are describing the overflowScroll option. [Example](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/scrolling.html).

From the docs

> **scrollOverflow:** (default false) defines whether or not to create a scroll for the section in case its content is bigger than the height of it. When set to true, your content will be wrapped by the plugin. Consider using delegation or load your other scripts in the afterRender callback. In case of setting it to true, it requires the vendor plugin jquery.slimscroll.min and it should be loaded before the fullPage.js plugin. For example:

Now it's working fine but if for example i open the google chrome inspect element, the window size will be resized and after 1 second i will be redirected automatically on other section. I had this problem only when 'autoScrolling' is false. When it's true everything works fine.

Demo: http://zshare.xyz/inspire-lounge/#evenimente
The inspect element should be docked to bottom and should overlap the content of that section when it's opened.

You are not suppose to use scrollOverflow:true when you use autoScrolling:false. The plugin doesn't support it.

1697,2015-12-02 23:37:36,"I'm having trouble with this code at http://vatuvara.com/ 

Basically I want #masthead to have a class of 'black-nav' added if the visitor is not in the first section of the page, and then I want this class removed if they are in the first section of the page.

$(document).ready(function() {
    $('#primary').fullpage({
      menu: '#masthead',

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

});

This seems to work fine, except when I add a link to a section on the homepage eg. the 'About' nav links to http://vatuvara.com/#TheIslands. So I added a secondary script to change the masthead's class when #primary-menu a is clicked.

$(document).ready(function() {
  $(""#primary-menu a"").click(function() { 
    $('#masthead').addClass('black-nav');
  });
});

But the results are a bit mixed. Clicking on 'About', then scrolling back to the top of the page works about 50% of the time — the 'black-nav' class is removed, but the rest of the time it doesn't so #masthead continues to have the .black-nav class.

I also have another script which has similar results. I want the nav to be hidden when scrolling down, but re-appear when scrolling up. So I have this script below which seems to work about 70% of the time, the rest of the time #masthead continues to have the .black-nav class. And if you scroll to the very bottom of the page, then scroll back up the success rate drops to about 50%

 // Hide Header on on scroll down
  var didScroll;
  var lastScrollTop = 0;
  var delta = 5;
  var navbarHeight = $('#masthead').outerHeight();

  $(window).scroll(function(event){
    didScroll = true;
  });

  setInterval(function() {
    if (didScroll) {
      hasScrolled();
      didScroll = false;

In fact, even if I just press down with two fingers, it fires `up` twice. Now, I know this seems like a trackpad issue, or a non fullpage.js issue, but here's where it gets weird and I'm hoping you have some insight.

The [demo example page](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) works smoothly for me. However, the [demo wordpress page)(https://themify.me/demo/#theme=fullpane) does not, and it actually suffers from the same issue that my site has. My site is using wordpress too btw.

fullPage.js automatically plays HTML 5 videos when you enter in the section / slide with them if they have the `autoplay` property.

For example:

Let me know if it improves by adding the following css to the the **fullpage.js container**:

I would in any case recommend you to make use of some kind of lazy loading technique. You can use the one [provided by fullpage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#lazy-loading) or make your own if you want to lazy load multiple sections ahead, something like [this suggestion](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/46#issuecomment-26509996).

Besides that, if you can, I would encourage you to create the content of sections dynamically as well. That will reduce the number of DOM elements to move and very probably result in a performance improvement.

I removed a line of code in the JS that was generating some HTML code with dynamic content and everything is back to normal! 

That was the problem. Now why? I have no idea. The content is simple. It loops through an array and generates a div with 2 pieces of text and a button (like a pop-up for each section). I'm gonna try have the HTML structure in the DOM when the page loads, and just insert the content dynamic.

First, thanks for your great plugin. This is the first time I use it in a future stable site. I'm a beginner with JavaScript.

I'm using some lines of code I found on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24793062/multiple-instances-of-fullpage-js#new-answer"">stackoverflow</a> + <a href=""http://julian.com/research/velocity/"">velocity.js</a> to add animate transitions between sections:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

but the code apply the transition to the current slide (or the slide is passing) not to the next slide (or the slide is coming) like I expect. I tray with <code> slideIndex </code> but this just do nothing.

Other way I can use:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

But result complex because I have many sliders and I want to find a different way that apply a transition to each slide separately (better all at once).

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The down ""coming"" section it's correctly animated, but if I define `(direction == 'up')`doesn't work for me by now, so I continue using `nth-child()` on direction up and working on find a `eq()` solution.

1660,2015-11-20 16:36:15,"Hey @alvarotrigo, the reason you see the scrollbar come up is because you are swiping up rather quickly (we've done this test multiple times). If you scroll up slowly, then you will see that it stays disappeared. Us developers have gotten used to just rolling through things, ha!

If you scroll down a little, then scroll up slowly, say if a user is reading or is trying to see details of something, OR if they scroll down a bit and notice they don't like the content and scroll back up then the bar will stay hidden.

I recommend we also implement a check when the user switches between slides to verify the fp-section is the same as the innerHeight. As of now, we've manually added this into the afterLoad callback. This should be baked into the plugin. I'll add it into the develop pull request. Apologies on adding it to master here, first time doing a pull request :) Will update in an hour or two.

Not in my iPhone 5 iOS 8 (and neither in the testings I did in browserstack.com) No matter how slowly you scroll up, **the bars will always appear** on the 1st section, but slower.

That would only execute once per section, but in the case of going to the 1st section, as I said, the top and bottom navigation bars appear bit by bit at the same time of the scroll and at the same speed.

I'm currently using fullPage.js and have found it great, apart from I have come across one issue.
I currently have an 'index' (index.html) page which has a list of URLs in a container, all of which then have a relative fullPage.js section on another URL. For example:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The #FULLPAGE is where I place the name of the relative anchor in fullPage.js, and when clicking on the index project link it should redirect to that specific 'section' on another page (i.e projects.html), but it goes to the first. This is a safari specific issue and I believe it's to do with Safari not processing hash fragments, whereas Chrome and Firefox preserve them. 

If there's any information that you could provide as I'm sure that there have been others trying to do a similar thing with fullPage.js that would be great. Let me know if any more information is needed, thanks.

Not exactly. It depends on the inertia. It won't assure 100%  to avoid double scrolls if you scroll pretty fast. But as it is not common to scroll that fast, its a number that won't super annoy users but will assure to avoid most of the double scrolls.

700 has proven to be a good number in the past. That's all.

I don't think that force pause after page scroll will be good solution since it will annoy users with mouse wheels and keyboards.

Many developers use small scrollingSpeed values (because it looks cool and fast) but they don't use touchpads, so they even don't know that touchpad users will experience scrolling problem on their websites.

I would suggest adding ""Known issues"" section to documentation or a note about this issue to section describing ""scrollingSpeed"" property — at least it will decrease the amount of opened tasks about this problem and warn developers about risks :)

The number of people reporting or asking for this kind of issue has decreased significantly since the new solution was adopted time ago.
It seems not many people opt for a faster scrolling and they don't usually have problems with it.

",alvarotrigo,
1654,2015-12-10 02:07:43,"I came on here to report the issue but seems someone beat me to the punch. 

Here's what I've found.

1) 500 seems to be the ""breaking"" point. 600 will work fine but 500 won't. 
2) It depends on the length of stroke on the trackpad. As was said, a short quick stroke will scroll two pages. A long stroke won't. I can reproduce it fairly consistently and on a Dell trackpad as well.
3) For me the only reason it would be an issue is responsiveness. In beta testing my site some users complained that 700 felt ""too unresponsive"" or ""slow"". I changed to 400 and that was much better received but then some had issues with scrolling two sections instead of one. For now I've limited the scroll speed to 600. I think from a user experience standpoint it is preferable to have as slightly slower scroll speed than to have two sections scroll past.

Is there a way to make an option where a true value limits scrolling to just the next section and false lets you scroll in the default way?

currently working on a website with two sections. The upper section is made up from around 100 thumbnails and therefore overflows the container. The lower section is three slideshows which are responsive and next to each other.

Fullpage is setup like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

`$.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(false);` only overrides the transitioning from slide to slide. 
(Wanted behaviour)
`$.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(false, 'down');` overrides the touch scrolling on an iPad. 
(Unwanted behaviour)

Scrolling to section two is triggered by the spacebar or a button. However, the user should be able to simple scroll/swipe up again from section two to section one. Therefore it would be great if I could simply deactivate down scrolling, but keep `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;` behaviour.

Just use the option `sectionSelector` and use another one for fullpage.js. 
Not quite sure to understand what you mean when you talk about React. This has nothing to do with it.

But when I clear the active sections the external links, it works fine to any section. I think the problem is with the active sections/slides

1642,2015-11-10 15:24:21,"I noticed is that your callbacks can only be setup at initialization time.  I think you could have a nice little enhancement by adding a custom event for each of the callbacks that you currently offer.  This way other library designers and developers can listen for the events instead of having to be loaded and be part of your object initialization.

Here is an example of what I’m talking about.  NOTE:  The code isn’t optimized, but I think you’ll get the idea.

Needs an additional check when using the scroll bar (see commit).
I did some tests and can't find any issues with that approach so far. However, I don't know what issues it might cause in other configurations although I can't think of any.
Also, a similar approach could be used for an auto height top section.

Many things are possible with the right knowledge. 
Fullpage.js doesn't provide a direct way of doing that, but you could if you make use of some external plugin to create those animations inside the slide and make use of some fullpage.js callbacks such as `onLeave` to cancel the movement when scrolling up or down and to fire the external plugin actions.

When `scrollOverflow: true` and scrolling to next/prev slide, content can continue to scroll within the slide, see screencast: http://jmp.sh/J7LdT0C

This is reproducible with your 'Scrolling inside sections' demo:
http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/scrolling.html

I experience this using a trackpad or free-spinning/swipe mouse wheel - but not with an regular ol' mouse wheel or on a touch device (iPhone 5, iOS 9.1). This implies it might be due to 'left over' scroll inertia.

Not sure how this would be preventable - perhaps temporarily disabling the scroll event... although there is no guarantee that, after a delay, there still wouldn't be some leftover inertia when you reinstate it.

Will scratch my head and do some googling, and create a codepen to test in, and post back any thoughts.

You expect everyone in life to work for you by free? Nice philosophy uh? 
Do you value the same way the work of others in real life? I really doubt it....
I'm giving away for free the whole library in which I've spent **hundreds of hours** during more than **3 years**. But I guess that doesn't count for you? 
It won't stop to amaze me how little some people value free things in life. 

One thing is for sure. If everybody were like you, there will be no free libraries at all.  ",alvarotrigo,2017-01-17 22:40:19
1626,2015-10-30 16:07:41,"Hi there!

Thanks again for this great plugin. However today I found an unexpected kind of behaviour.. Here I explain it a bit more.

So my issue is relatively simple. I have a few auto-height section in my page and I have some animations  going on in the afterLoad() callback..

So basically, in order to avoid these animations to load in case I load the section 4(ie) first, I replace the active tag in the correct html element (section) on the afterRender() callback. Otherwise animations for section 1 would be triggered anyway.

However, and weirdly enough, the section then snaps to the top of the screen and not to the bottom of the screen...which is what I want obviously :/

So my question is, is there a way to avoid that behaviour?

I have a codepen here: http://codepen.io/DanDvoracek/pen/Yyvrza
Copy paste the code in a single html file to see what I mean as the history can't be seen on codepen...

In the demo I provide, try removing the active class on the second section and try load the #txt route. See the behaviour with and without the active tag.. 

Is there any way we can change it to snap at the bottom?

Thanks in advance,
",DanDvoracek,2016-01-25 13:34:30
1626,2015-10-30 16:13:38,"I don't understand why should I copy and paste the content of the codepen in another page. Can you clarify that?

And... what exactly is your problem? I didn't see anything weird.
Also, I don't know what ""active tags"" are you talking about because you are not doing anything with them in your codepen. 
",alvarotrigo,2016-01-25 13:34:30
1626,2015-10-30 18:18:18,"Hey! 
Thanks for the reply. I tried to make it very clear and it seems fine to me but I'll clarify a couple of points.

When I say: 

""Copy paste the code in a single html file to see what I mean as the history can't be seen on codepen...""

It's because you can not add /#txt in your url and see the result. You would simply be able to scroll, not enter a specific url... Does that make sense? In order to play with the history and see it in your url, you would have to copy paste the code in an index.html you created (unless you have a trick that I don't know..) and run it locally. No big deal, you can simply copy paste what you see in the Pen.. 

""Also, I don't know what ""active tags"" are you talking about because you are not doing anything with them in your codepen.""

Well, I should have said the active class: 

class=""section fp-auto-height active""

Well in this very simple example I am not doing much with it as I want to keep the demo simple...So basically test it with it, and without.

As for my problem, try to hit the index.html/#txt url with the active class AND without. See the difference of behaviour. 

Two different things happen:
1. With the active class, it snaps the top of the section to the top of the page (nice for a full height div, less nice for an fp-auto-height..).
2. Without the active class, it scrolls to the section and remains as expected at the bottom of the page.

What I want is basically case 1 to remain at the bottom when it's fp-auto-height... Possible? Does that make more sense?

Thanks,
",DanDvoracek,2016-01-25 13:34:30
1626,2015-10-30 20:18:59,"Actually I found a simple solution. And maybe it will all make sense to you this time ;)

So my solution first (maybe not optimal, but it works..):

I check the url on afterRender() and I start by removing the active class of any section that has it. Then I obviously add it to the section where I want it to be.

Something in those lines..

on afterRender():
if(location.hash === '#section-2'){
    activeSection = '#section-2';
    makeSectionActive(activeSection);
}

and then..:
makeSectionActive = function(activeSection) {
    $('.active').removeClass('active');
    $(activeSection).addClass('active');  
}

I don't consider this as a bug or what, just to make clear. It was actually more of a question about the plugin. But maybe adding something like that could be useful..?

There are some effects that I am not sure man wants to be triggered in case a user hits the url of an ""internal section"". As for now, the plugin allows you to fire some events at different moment (onLeave(), afterLoad(),..). However, as soon as you use these methods, the first section will always be loaded or ""left"" and therefore the events of the first section will always be triggered (the ""active"" class always seems to appear on this section first..) Does that make any sense?

Basically in my case, I found that little detail that I had to work around a little, and I think it could be interesting to have something in those lines by default for the plugin. I'm happy to give a hand by the way!

I can swipe left from the homepage, to bring up a new panel. The new panel allows vertical scrolling. But swiping back to the home panel only works when touching the blue bar on the left, but not swiping on white area.

I figured disabling `overflow-y: auto;` helps, but the panel needs scrolling. My example is here: http://eltek-staging.eystein.no/

Anyway, it looks like you are not using `scrollOverflow`. So you might be doing something in your side to prevent the scrolling down or up once you reach the slide.

No it doesn't really. Vertically to what? Your section is not even using `scrollOverflow` and therefore will only have the viewport height.

You would have to use some scrollbar or use `scrollOverflow:true` and then `reBuild` once you open your row. But that wouldn't center it vertically. It would just allow you to scroll to the content.

I'm having an issue with some drop down menus on my WordPress theme not working when on a page with the plugin:

http://haines.co.uk.gridhosted.co.uk/testimonials/

I've narrowed down the issue to me inserting the jquery.js code into the page:
`<script src=""http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js""></script>`
if I remove that, the issue doesn't occur but the plugin also doesn't work.
I find this strange as my WordPress site already includes jquery in the header of every page throughout the site yet I have to reference it again for some reason, when I do the dropdowns no longer work.

If anyone could help me fix this issue I'd be really grateful.

I want to build my own custon navigation with no anchorlinks in the URL (lockAnchors: true)
I don't mean modifying the default circles navigation bar. I mean an all new navbar.

I've managed to do it in two ways:
1) Change my custom navigation id to ""#fp-nav"".
The problem is that adds all css from fullPage.css, forces me to use that id, and doesn't work for slides inside a section.

2) Modifying jquery.fullPage.js line 1637 to 1631

> //Scrolls to the section when clicking the navigation bullet  
>      $document.on('click touchstart',**'.my-nav-links'**, function(e){

>             scrollPage($(SECTION_SEL).eq(index));  
>         });
> Still, that doesn't work for slides inside sections. And only works if the links are in the same order as the sections.

So... is there any easier way to accomplish this? Any way to call a section by its anchorname or index outside the jquery.fullPage.js file ?
I've tryied using **scrollPage** and **moveTo** in my custom .js file, after initialization and inside callbacks... with no success.

1604,2015-10-20 09:39:43,"> So... is there any easier way to accomplish this?

Yeah. Use the `menu` option. 
You can create any kind of menu / nav with it and it will add the active class where it should. 

From [the documentation](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js):

> **menu:** (default false) A selector can be used to specify the menu to link with the sections. This way the scrolling of the sections will activate the corresponding element in the menu using the class active. **This won't generate a menu but will just add the active class to the element in the given menu with the corresponding anchor links**. In order to link the elements of the menu with the sections, an HTML 5 data-tag (data-menuanchor) will be needed to use with the same anchor links as used within the sections. Example:
> 
> I've tryied using scrollPage and moveTo in my custom .js file, after initialization and inside callbacks... with no success.

I have the following website setup:

![photo_2015-10-09_13-15-50](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6825057/10392499/e9d98886-6e87-11e5-9456-43d9b56f5284.jpg)

Every fullpage section has two slides. On the first slide, the amount of content is small enough to fit inside the dimensions of one screen. On the second slide, the amount of content is way bigger, so scrollOverflow is set to true to make scrolling possible.

I would like to disable setAllowScrolling on each second slide, therefore I used the following javascript in the onSlideLeave callback.

> $.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(nextSlideIndex == 0);

On Chrome and Firefox, this works like a charm. On Safari however, scrolling on a second slide doesn't work. It does work after you manually grab the slimscroll bar and move it a little bit with your mouse pointer. It also works if you change the $.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling value in the console of the browser directly. I think something goes wrong while initializing the slimscroll plugin in Safari using this setup.

Why would you do that?
It makes no sense to have two scroll bars from the UX perspective.
",alvarotrigo,2015-10-09 13:28:48
1584,2015-10-09 16:12:26,"I am not convinced that we are talking about the same concept. Let me try to explain it in greater detail.

I'd like the second slide to act as a 'more information' page for each first slide. The idea is to add a 'back' button in the upper left corner and the bottom of each second slide to return to the first slide.

> Why would you do that?

It's very confusing if a user scrolls to the bottom of a 'more information' second slide, whereafter he get's a transition to the next 'more information' second slide. That's why I want to make it impossible to switch sections if a user is looking at a second slide. At the bottom of the slide the user sees a clear visual cue that the bottom of the slide is reached, with a button to return to slide 1 of the current section.

> It makes no sense to have two scroll bars from the UX perspective.

My idea does not involve two scroll bars. It only involves one scroll bar on each second 'more information' slide, being the slimscroll one. This is the correct usage of the scrollOverflow option.

The only problem is that prohibiting a user from switching sections when he is on a second slide, using the setAllowScrolling method, seems to break the scrollOverflow function in Safari.

Long story short: I am looking for a way to enable scrolling in one slide of a section, but disable switching between sections from that slide. The obvious way to handle this works in Chrome and Firefox, but breaks the scrollOverflow scrolling functionality in Safari.

Nop, we are not. My fault. I read it very fast and I though you said `$.fn.fullpage.setAutoscrolling(false)`  instead of `$.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(false)`.

I'll open the issue again. 
In any case, it seems a slimScroll problem again. Have you tried using an scrollable element instead ? `overflow-y:scroll`.

Think of the slider as being an intro to the website that when finished scrolls to the main website that can then we navigated as normal.

I'm using the `destroy` method to remove the slider when on the last slide with the intention of the natural browser scrolling to be reinstated – the scrolling that is applied by the script to slides doesn't quite match the natural scrolling of the browser (seems a bit too quick in comparison to a normal page).

In doing this however, the scrolling is disabled completely when destroying the slider. I've knocked up a quick example that hopefully shows what I'm trying to do better than I can explain it: https://jsfiddle.net/yhn9x16v/

I've tested this is Latest Chrome, Firefox and Safari – all results are the same.

You'll notice I'm also using the `onLeave` callback rather than `afterSlideLoad` which I assume would negate the need for the `setTimeout` however I can't seem to get that to work. It looks like that particular callback isn't working? It's quite possible that I'm doing something wrong.

1578,2015-10-07 09:37:19,"Yep, that's totally normal. 
The plugin needs your DOM structure to be ready in order to get initialized. And meanwhile, your content will be visible in the order it should.

Instead of using fullpage.js at the bottom of your page before the cosing `</body>` I would recommend you to load it on your header `<header>` of your site.

Same as with any other plugin or script you use. 
**Why?**
Because the only reason to add the plugins at the bottom of the site is to prevent the site to be ""blocked"" until they load.
But if your main purpose is to **only show the site content** once the plugin is initialized, then there's no reason at all to add them at the bottom of your site. 

That should solve your problem. 
Just place all of this in your header:

> <S_CODE_TOKEN>

You can test it with any example provided in the plugin. You'see how you don't see the flickering. Basically because the plugin is loaded in the header.

I'm afraid that's not possible. fitToSection can not exist if the plugin is not initialised.

Not really. `scrollBar:true` runs with `autoScrolling:true`.

Although, not sure why you made that many changes in the CSS file. It seems like you changed the order. Why? Oh, and the indentation as well. 

I saw you also changed the absolute links to relative ones in the documentation such as this one:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Could you revert those changes as well? Keeping them absolute helps in case some sites copy the readme content into theirs or even for sites such as [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fullpage.js) which extracts the docs from github. I prefer them to always link to the github docs.

Try not using anchor or using  `lockAnchors:true`. Otherwise, you'll have to use `autoScrolling:false` or `scrollBar:true`.

In any case, there's nothing that can be done in the plugin deal with that. That depends on each browser and we have no access to the address bar controls.

## Delta and scrolling on Mac OS X

Thanks for creating this awesome script! I noticed that scroll will often trigger unexpectedly on Mac OS X so I added a minDelta value to work around that. It’s set to a default of 20 which seems like a nice balance between not having to scroll too hard and not accidentally causing unwanted scrolling.
## Node modules

I noticed that node_modules weren't excluded from the repo so I went ahead and did that.
## Minification

That's completely normal. The section with more content in the viewport will be the one set to `active`.

With mousewheel the incoming section gets the active class immediately, as soon as the scrolling starts.  I can work around with the onLeave callback to target prev/next sections.  You might want to look into it though since if someone is using the active class for styling it behaves differently between mouse and touchpad/scrollbar.  Thanks for the quick replies!

1549,2015-09-26 23:33:25,"I'm not sure if this is a bug or just an issue that could be fixed with documentation.

I am using both scrollOverflow: true and normalScrollElements so that certain slides with a lot of content will scroll through the content but not to other slides/sections (I have other navigation elements for getting to other slides). 

When I upgraded from 2.6.0 to 2.7.2, this functionality changed in a way I didn't expect. My site had been structured like this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I had `normalScrollElements` set to `.slide-content`.

In 2.7.2, that structure produced behavior where I could scroll from the first section to the second, but once I got to the second, scrolling stopped. When I went to the second slide in the second section (.slide-content), I still got the expected behavior (content scrolling, but locked so as not to scroll to other sections).

The way that I worked around the issue was to change the structure to this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Once I did that, I could scroll between sections as desired, as well as having the `.slide-content` slides scroll through their content but not to other slides (as desired).

That leads me to think that setting `normalScrollElements` to `.slide-content` and having `.slide-content` on the same div as `.slide` caused the `normalScrollElements` functionality to apply to all the `.slide` divs. It didn't apply to the first section because the first section had no slides.

Again, this behavior was not happening when I was on 2.6.0.

I'm using your plugin to built a Wordpress theme, all works fine, but the auto scroll on horizontal slides change the timeout without any reason after some time on the page.

I add these lines:

You mean, it scrolls down two sections when you just want to scroll one?

It looks like you are scrolling too hard and the kinetic scrolling inertia is firing the second scroll.

I'm using only short swipes and sometimes it scrolls properly, sometimes not. The difference is almost imperceptible. 
I understand that there is a limit, and when scrolling is longer, the inside scroll starts. But i noticed, that inside scroll starts before scrolling animation ends. I think plugin should prevent inside scrolling until animation ends.

So it should be like this:
i scroll -> section reaches end -> changing sections -> section change animation ends -> if i still scrolling inside scroll starts.

Apparently this is a well known bug, but backgrounds on iOS scale to the body div and not screen size with size:cover. What effectively happens is the image gets rendered at full-scale, thus only showing the top-left corner of it, zoomed in (depending on size of image)

The solution that is often given (https://css-tricks.com/forums/topic/full-page-backgrounds-on-ios-background-size-cover/page/3/) is to make div fixed and size: 100% 100%, but with fullpage.js, if I want my second slide down to have a background image, that solution won't work.

I searched the web and this forum to see if anyone else had come across this problem, and I was surprised to not find anything.

Has anyone come across this problem before and may know of a solution?

Any tips/ideas?

So here is another attempt to make it more clear. 
See this demo as a starting point: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/

Basically I would need to detect the scroll INSIDE a section in order to set a callback and process some animations in this exact same section. 
The aim being that I would like to switch/extend the content of the section once the user scroll inside it.

However, if I do so in the same way as the demo, the browser would scroll to the next section instead of triggering my callback function. Does that make sense?

I really need the scroll behaviour like in the demo, but inside a section itself. Does that make sense? I'm not sure I can make it any clearer.

EDIT: I have seen that man can set a section to allow scroll inside it. However I didn't find how to return the scroll position of inside the section...

So an easy alternative to my case would probably to do that but I would prefer to use some callbacks instead of hacking into it too much. 
Having said that, a behaviour like the demo - inside a section - would be perfect, as all the callback functions etc are already part of your framework. Which is great by the way!

Then, [you can cancel the scroll before it takes place](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#cancelling-the-scroll-before-it-takes-place) and do whatever you want instead.

So I'm coming back with my little problem.

I tried your suggestion of returning false on the onLeave callback.. However this stops the scroll in a way that (I think, maybe I missed something) it is impossible to enable it again (?).

I actually found another way of telling you what my problem is about.
This example is pretty much what I do: http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#3rdPage

BUT I need to find a way to keep the same background for two sections. Does that make sense? 

Regarding your example, it would mean that once you get to the ""Easy to use plugin"" section (for example), the background color (in my case a bg image) will remain fixed and the next section will slide on overlay and snap like it does for all the sections ... Is that clear? I can quickly make a drawing if you prefer..

Most importantly, is there a way to achieve this with you plugin / a workaround for this?

Dan

There's probably a way, just make use of the callbacks and options the plugin provides.
You might also want to look into CSS in order to fix a background, although there might be some troubles with `css3:true` for that.

I would encourage you to ask in other place such as http://stackoverflow.com/ in which they might help you in this regard.

I configured fullPage with `responsiveWidth` set to `801`. Unfortunately, below 801px in width, the plugin works normally, as above 801px. How can I turn it off then?

I would also disable the plugin from firing on all pages but homepage. How to do it?

Please read the documentation regarding the responsive options:

> **responsiveWidth:** (default 0) A normal scroll (autoScrolling:false) will be used under the defined width in pixels. A class fp-responsive is added to the plugin's container in case the user wants to use it for his own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's width is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site.
>

A class fp-responsive is added to the plugin's container in case the user wants to use it for his own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's height is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site.

You would need to manually destroy it by listening the `resize` event and then calling the `destroy` function.

You'd better ask in other place such as http://stackoverflow.com/ in which they'll provide you a better answer regarding the procedure of listening the resize event and check the site width.

1524,2015-09-19 22:51:56,"Hi there, 

First of all : a Huge thanks to this awesome plug-in ! I'm using it very often and never experienced any bug until the website I'm doing right now :)

I'm not 100% sure it's due to fullPage.js. I'm experiencing a very weird chrome (45 and 46 windows only) behaviour when I switch from the first to the second slide of my website. : The transitions ""freeze"" 80% of the time. When ""CSS3"" is ""true"" it goes instantly from the first to the second slide, but when ""CSS3"" is ""false"" the transition between the first and the second slide is playing but each other CSS3 transition in the page are instantly on their final stage. They are not playing.

You can take a look by yourself if you are on windows :
1. first you will need to login as the website is still under construction.  www.evandorlot.com/wp-login
   Login : Guest - Pass: Luckyone

then, come back to the home page www.evandorlot.com
1. Sroll down, here's the bug. From the first to the second slide of the website, the transitions ""freeze"" they pop instantly to their final stage.
2. After pressing ctrl+f5 and trying again, sometime it work, sometime no... 

I'm working on this bug for more than a week now and don't find any solutions: 
I tried to disable all the TweenMax animations, then all the css3 animations that are not vital. I also disabled all my custom javascript except fullpage.js function without any configuration, I tried removing the image from the second slide, deleting the second slide, swapping the second slide with another, replacing the image, the text, deleting the diamond icon, deleting the menu on the bottom right corner, activating GPU acceleration by adding CSS3 ""translateZ"" to each elements that is animated on the first and second slide... Nothing fixed the bug.

The only way to make it working properly is to empty ALL the content from the second slide and leave the entire section empty. So I guess something cause the issue, but I really don't know what.

I know it's a long shot but if anyone has already experienced similar bug or has a suggestion to fix it. It will be very useful as I'm totally desperate :)

PS: I'm using the last version of Fullpage.js

Angular app is set up to load a template and insert data through a loop. so its set up like so:

<div id=""fullpage"">
<div class=""section"">
<angular-directive  data-ng-controller=""controller stuff""></angular-directive>
</div>

<div class=""section"">
<angular-directive data-ng-controller=""controller stuff""></angular-directive>
</div>

<div class=""section"">
<angular-directive data-ng-controller=""controller stuff""></angular-directive>
</div>


Each section loads as fullpages, and scrolls correctly.

Inside each angular-directive, it's set up:

<div class=""slide"" data-ng-repeat=""loop through my data"">
[looped data]
</div>


when it loads: the data loads, but in sequence all in one section, not separate slides.

i might drop angular, as i only coded it for fun. it isnt really that necessary.

1522,2015-09-21 07:51:17,"@kaiserhase How are you loading content into your app? Are the slides initializing with ng-repeat? I [made an angular directive](https://github.com/hellsan631/angular-fullpage.js) that might interest you, and should cover most basic support for using fullpage with angular. I've been able to solve some issues, but the one I have trouble with is dynamic DOM changes and how to react to them.

Angular can dynamically change the DOM based on what ever events the developer wants. In order to react to these changes, I currently have to [destroy and re-initialize](https://github.com/hellsan631/angular-fullpage.js/blob/master/angular-fullpage.js#L25) the entire plugin. I've looked at the docs for `$.fn.fullpage.reBuild()` and I would imagine this might work, but I haven't had any luck with it actually updating the DOM structure. 

Example: I want to bind a click event to a button that adds a slide dynamically on page. In order for fullPage.js to recognize that this new slide (added to the DOM after a click event) exists, my thoughts are that I should be calling `$.fn.fullpage.reBuild()` instead of `destroy('all')`, correct?

Yet when I do this, nothing happens. Currently, I am using a work around that tracks the current page/slide and after a destroy/build cycle, it will move to the last page/slide, but this takes up several plugin functions and the animations still happen (even though i'm using a silent move-to for some reason). 

An example of this can be [found here](http://hellsan631.github.io/angular-fullpage.js/), under second slide.

Any insights into this, @alvarotrigo?

1522,2015-09-21 08:58:03,"@hellsan631 maybe I should be more specific on the documentation for `reBuild`. 
That function will only take into account changes you made inside sections / slides. Not in the number of slides or sections you have.
The purpose of the function is mainly to provide users who use `scrollOverflow:true` a way to update the DOM and then tell fullpage.js that the scroll bar for that section needs to be updated. 

Destroying it and initializing it again is the way to go for it for now.

Indeed you can, but think that any other updates of fullpage.js won't have that reverted change and you won't be able to use newer version of fullpage.js without reverting the change by yourself.

See the changes [here.](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/commit/8561fd59ff4cbe2149b239a1ae32f719e7aebf6a)

Revert the ones for `addTouchHandler` and `removeTouchHandler`.:

Instead of `$(WRAPPER_SEL).off` use `$document.off` for those two functions.

It seems you are trying to scroll within a section to a certain internal anchor by its `id`.

I would say you can not use internal anchors to scroll to anywhere in your site, as this is a full page plugin and therefore the browser scrolling to the `id` element will move all the sections in the wrong position. 

You can only fix it if you decide to use fullpage.js with the option `scrollBar:true` or `autoScrolling:false`.

1509,2015-09-15 11:59:38,"Hi
I implemented fullpage.js for a project and found the following behaviour:

After clicking some sections and scrolling through the page, some anchor-links stop working.
The are formatted correctly but do not jump to the section.

The strange thing is, that this only ""sometimes"" happens which makes it very hard to track...

For example:
http://46.101.149.29/home-en/
Start clicking different sections/anchor-links and then return to ""01 About -> Introduction"" (or any other link, mostly the ones at the top of the list) - it gets stuck.
Why is this?

I tried to exclude any other js file or put the whole navigation in one big list, but didnt find anything.

I am using basic bootstrap (with bootstrap.js) for the menu-dropdowns - the fullpage.js setup looks like this

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

(getAnchors collects all the anchors).

Thanks for your help and the great script!

The addition of the style `overflow:hidden` in the `html` element seems to be the cause of it.
Just before the statement `$('html').addClass(ENABLED);` both values are the same.

which consolidates all code related to scrollOverflow and
allows it to be swapped out with different functionality.

By default, it will use the existing jquery.slimScroll handling
of scroll overflow.

This should make it easier for users to either customize the
slimScroll handling or replace it with other code just as wrapping

1497,2015-09-09 17:09:24,"Hi Alvàro,

I have different Google Maps in different sections.
The maps should remain draggable and while dragging the fullpage scroll should be blocked.
On desktop, with trackpad, adding the option `normalScrollElements: '.map',` it works (after dragging a map, the section scroll is disabled – I've added an overlay div above the map to see if moving trackpad on it the section keeps moving).
But normalScrollElements doesn't seem to affect touch devices.
What's worst is that on tablet fullPage scroll seems to get crazy, since it often scrolls in the opposite direction to your swipe. I can't understand why it behaves so.

I've tried to reproduce the issue here: http://codepen.io/dademaru/pen/pjJXpd
(the first section is an empty section only to try the scroll on sections without maps).
Maybe you already have a fix.
Thanks

If you want to do so, what I would recommend is disabling the scroll in all directions with `setAllowScrolling` once your reach the map section ( by using a callback such as `afterLoad`).

Then, in order to move up or down I would add two arrows (or whatever you prefer) to which you can bind the `moveSectionDown` or `moveSectionUp` functions.

I have other pages with full background slides inside sections (with a text overlay always above them, fixed with `position: absolute`), so I thought it was possible to have a similar layout for maps, with text overlay that can be activated / deactivated as needed (to see background images or full screen maps).

I need different maps like this website: http://energycoalition.org/energy-architects-in-action/
one for each section, with marker links in the overlay.

I'm going to try what you suggested, by disabling the scroll with `afterLoad` when section has a map.
I already have custom buttons with keyboard support to let you move between sections even when scroll is disabled: my concern was with touch swipe with Google Maps.

I let you know, meanwhile thanks for your support.

Not sure if this is the right place to mention this, as i'm not very into github:

I was going to mention the fp-auto-height function wasn't working properly, but of course, it is.
The reason it didn't out of the box for me was that the required CSS didn't come with the plugin.

As you mentioned at #1263 the auto-height works well with the CSS.

I don't need to know about your `ascx` files or what they do in the server side. I just need to know how its working in the front end with the resulting code.

I'm using webflow and i'm happy about using it.
I'm using Fullpage plugin and i'm more than happy about using it too.

It works well, except one thing, it stops the native animations ""onscroll"" from working.
Basely, I have a menu created by Webflow and i set an effect to make the text change color when the section is on the screen.. but from the moment i added fullpage, it does not change anymore.
Last point to notice, is the effect works only at the right moment i re-size the navigator window.

I'm not sure that i'm expressing my self very well, but it will be really great of you if you could help me.

Use `scrollBar:true` or `autoScrolling:false`.

If you still want to use the site without scroll bar, then learn how to use the callbacks or the CSS class added to the body. There's no need for external plugins to accomplish animations on section load.

You can still using anchors internally for your own functions and callbacks, but they won't have any effect in the scrolling of the site. Useful if you want to combine fullPage.js with other plugins using anchor in the URL.

You can even lock them dynamically with [`setLockAnchors`](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#setlockanchorsboolean) as you can see in [this other demo](http://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/yNxVRQ).

That way the current section doesn't scroll to fill the screen, it stays where you want it, which is very good when you have a lot of content in sections and want to be able to view it all on a phone.

I've tried numerous touchSensitivity values, but none seem to give a reasonable fluid swipe action.

I guess the issue is more down to the fact that it only scrolls when touching and dragging, as opposed to fast swipe scrolls - where the content keeps scrolling based on the length of the swipe.

Nop. I would encourage you to get rid of `scrollOverflow` and use the `responsive` option instead combined with [`fp-auto-heigh`](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#creating-smaller-sections) or [similar](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/1044#issuecomment-75812112).

Regardless, I believe if you place this in the `<head>` of your HTML it will allow your viewport to be responsive: `<meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1"">`

A good spot for this would be under `<meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" />` ... although it is not required to be there. Just as long as it is between your `<head> ... </head>` tags you should be alright.

Firstly, thanks for the awesome plugin!

I noticed an issue where when scrollOverflow is set to true, and when you try to scroll a section up or down, the scrolling of the overflowing section becomes intermittent after you reach the bottom of the page and want to scroll back up. This occurs on your demo site - http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/scrolling.html and is only on Chrome Desktop, no other browsers. It works again briefly when you either click into the section or type something into the console and does not occur on Chrome mobile.

I assume this is related to the Chrome 44 issue, but I'm raising this issue just encase.

Thanks,
Matt

I am on Windows 7 Ultimate with Chrome 45 and have the same issue.

The issue I see is when scrolling from the 2nd page back up to the 1st page, sometimes when you scroll again (to scroll the page's content), it doesn't scroll.  After I move my mouse it does scroll again. Also sometimes the 1st page scrolls back to its top and sometimes it doesn't.

It looks like a mousehover/mouseover issue because if I move my mouse or click on the page scrolling works again.

Hope this helps,

But as FP.moveTo calls to scrollPage which has a call to requestAnimFrame and it is asynchronous, the scrollingSpeed is reseted to its original value (700) and the movement is done WITH animation.

The solution would be to define the function moveTo with a third argument: callback and pass this callback to the function scrollPage, which accepts a callback as the second argument of the function.
Inside the callback would be the call to FP.setScrollingSpeed (originals.scrollingSpeed, 'internal');

I have the same problem with full-screen sliding blocks. After slide (transform) I can't hover anything until I click anywhere.

Example: I have some text in some div. After sliding (transform) and while trying to hover this text the text-edit cursor appears near the text I'm trying to hover.

_**My temporary solution is some little action with browser or DOM: append some element to body on sliding ends or trigger some event like $('body').trigger('resize').**_

Moved the local variable cache assignment out of `requestAnimationFrame` to avoid them being overwritten before being saved.

Also changed `!isResizing` to `!v.localIsResizing` in first check inside `requestAnimationFrame`.

Re-sizing bug no longer occurs, although the slides do animate after re-size instead of instantly snapping into position. I'm not sure if this was the original intended effect or not, so I'm leaving it as-is. The `css3: false` was for testing, it works with both CSS3 and JQuery animations.

1468,2015-08-25 20:10:54,"Hi there,

I am attempting combine a Bootstrap Navbar, with ScrollSpy enabled, with FullPage.js to navigate through anchored slides in a page. But I think that because of a previously discussed and document limitation/issue with naming the section IDs the same as the data-anchors, I am getting both scrollspy issues and issues with the last section of the page. Specifically, scroll spy is not working and the last section causes ""errors"" and navigates/animated incorrectly (shakes sporadically), and the slide after the first is skipped.

Is there an example available that integrates a Bootstrap Navbar that updates the ""active"" highlight with scrollspy working with FullPage.js? Specifically, one where the actively highlighted section in the Bootstrap Navbar updates as the user scrolls the page and the links in the navbar are able to link to slides in the page?

If not, might you have any insight onto getting these functions to play nice with one another?

Nop. But you wouldn't need to use scrollspy.... [fullpage.js already does it for you](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/normalScroll.html)...

Totally normal. Make use of the function `setAllowScrolling(false)` for those cases in which you don't want to wait for the element to appear to prevent the scroll.

The plugin doesn't provide any way to do it. You'll have to do it yourself.
You would have to attach and event to the mouse wheel scrolling when you reach a section with slides.
Then you would have to disable the plugin scrolling with `setAllowScrolling` and then you'll have to call `moveSlideRight`or `moveSlideLeft` depending on the direction of the scrolling.

I'm working on a project that uses the ScrollMagic plugin ""http://scrollmagic.io/"" which basically uses offsets to trigger its events.

I'm doing some extra work to combine this two libraries.
",alexandretperez,
1454,2015-08-23 14:20:37,"@alexandretperez that has nothing to do with this topic. You should be using `scrollBar:true` in fullpage.js for it and load the library in the `afterRender` callback. 
",alvarotrigo,
1454,2015-08-23 16:36:46,"@alvarotrigo I'm sorry, I wasn't clear enough.

I needed stop scrolling the sections at 60px from the top, but changing the css to do that also affects the bottom, overflowing in 60px because the wrapper has 100% of the viewport.

So I change the code adding the ""offset"" option with value 0 by default.

Then I change this:
 var windowsHeight = $window.height();

To this:
 var windowsHeight = $window.height() - options.offset;

and in the function ""init()"" I added:
if (options.offset) {
    container.css(""top"", options.offset);
    container.height(container.height() - options.offset);
}

This solved my needs.

Alexandre.

It is just the way it is. You won't be able to use maps unless you use `normalScrollElements` for it. But then, you won't be able to scroll to any other section if you are using it in fullscreen and using `autoScrolling:true`. 

If you are in fact using `normalScrollElements` [there's another bug regarding it which is has been opened for a while](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/1281).

I don't understand what you mean. Using 2.6.8 you would only have problems with Chrome, but if you use `scrollBar:true` the problem will dissapear for Chrome. (The rest work ok)

> Also, is scrollBar: true supposed to show the page as a normal scroll?

It does internally and allows the user to use the scroll bar. But the scrolling points will be fixed if you use a mouse wheel as you can see [in the example](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/scrollBar.html).

It seems to be a bug introduced in the latest version 2.6.7.1 after refactoring. 

You can use 2.6.7 instead, which doesn't have the bug, and has exactly the same features as 2.6.7.1.

In fact, the minified version was not updated and you can still use the master branch with it.

Please consider to use `$(window)[0].innerHeight` and `$(window)[0].innerWidth` instead of jQuery's .height() and .width() methods to get the screen dimensions.

I have a case where Android Chrome is returning 640px as the window height, but it is actually 511px.

I am using fullPage in a website and I need to have a section with normal scrolling. From the documentation, normalScrollElements should do the job(which it does) but the problem is that after using it on a section element, I cannot scroll further down to the other sections which do not use normalScrollElements.

Here's a link to my site:

You will see when you scroll, from Home, Collections to Showroom, it works fine. Showroom uses the normalScrollElements. Then when I try scrolling to Contact and About it just doesn't work.

The video of the first section doesn't play at first time (immediatly after the first load of the fullpagejs page).

Basically lets say you have a page with 5 sections, you want to scroll through them using your continuous middle mouse scroll function. Right now, half way every section, your scroll breaks and you have to click middle mouse again.

And analogy is that you are in the middle of a 'mousedown' and changing the hash triggers a 'mouseup' where you didn't expect it.

1) My second section, has a animation, where the elements of the section animate with scroll (say 3-4 scrolls), and the section itself does not scroll up.
2) Hence I need to customise fullpage.js such that, the scroll is disabled for that section, so that it does not scroll for a specific scroll duration. And get it back.
3) Animate the individual elements with the scroll. (Position:fixed, with a plugin like scrolltie?)

Im using the latest version of chrome on a mac.

When I'm on your site http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#firstPage I scroll down rapidly with the trackpad. Actually I'm scrolling like I would scroll down on a ""normal"" page as fast as possible. I'm scrolling rapidly even when the page is animating.

First, everything looks fine, then the animation that leads to the last slide jumps to a previous slide and then animates to the last slide. If you scroll up rapidly you can see that too: When the animation starts, it jumps to another slide or theres a sudden slight y-offset.

I don't see this effect when the scrollbars are turned on.

Maybe theres a problem with some js debouncing?

If you like, I can make a video of it.

1393,2015-07-24 14:40:57,"I have just encountered the problem I've described in the title.

Found these issues: https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/472 and https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/507 which report the same problem, just not the same origin.

JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/ow6g5ybc/1/

I have a quite complex site being developed with this plugin running the slides. My problem was that in few earlier iterations of the site, I've added an element that is absolutely positioned, outside of the initial 100% body width. Meaning, it will generate a horizontal scrollbar, which will make problems for calculating height of the screen, because it's then -15px (or so) smaller. Plugin initializes a moment later, and I didn't even notice the scrollbar for quite some time.

This isn't the plugin problem, just be careful when doing stuff like that. This was really needle in a haystack, but somehow I managed to find it.

Maybe, if you could read window height differently, to not include scrollbar, since scrollbar will be removed after plugin initializes. Just an idea, you check if this should be tagged as enhancement.

I'm not sure how else to report this. Label it however you want, this isn't really my issue, and basically I closed it with this.

Thank you for an amazing plugin! You've done great work!

Best regards

It is when you initialize the plugin, but it's invalid after that, because it includes scrollbar which appears because of absolute positioned element. Of course, same happens if you use translateX for repositioning some element outside of the slide.

Not really an issue, but noticed some folks having a similar issue, and they just might not have been careful and this could be the case.

1393,2015-09-22 14:08:47,"Basically, you need to make sure that your browser doesn't have any scrollbars just before the plugin is initialized. In my case, best solutions was to hide the elements before the plugin is initialized (I was able to do that, it might not be able to solve it like that in your case).

Other possible solutions would be to set max-height and overflow hidden to your sections, before the plugin is initialized (in crucial CSS, which should be loaded ASAP). Then once the plugin is initialized you can remove that.

You could also hide elements that are causing such behavior in JS just before initializing plugin, and show them in afterRender function, when plugin is initialized as it should.

If there are some other solutions, I'd gladly consider? But either way, this isn't a plugin problem but the problem to your implementation. Not sure if related to #1502

Coffee by default returns the last statement in methods / functions. If you don't want to return anything, then you need to use `return` on your last line (somewhat unfortunate).

compiles to

Although that's lazy distance for slides.
Ideally lazyDistance will be for both, slides and sections. 

Also, consider wrapping all of it in a function. Something like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Oh, and, the condition `if( slide.length ) {` seems to be there to only deal with the first slide of each section when landing in any slide coming from other vertical section.

Your code should also be applied when moving from slide to slide. So I believe it shouldn't be placed inside that condition.

You might probably want to do something different to solve it. **Your menu have to be closed before the plugin starts to scroll.**

I'd recommend you to make use of the function `$.fn.fullpage.moveTo` inside a timeout. So you can have enought time to close the menu before forcing fullpage.js to scroll.

Something like:

Ideally if your menu plugin provides a callback when its closed you could use it instead of the timeout solution.

I'm working on a project that needs a slide only 1 time, like if the index page was cut in two part. The moveSectionDown function is working very well, including touching and violent scrolling -> nice job!  and allow me to go to the second section correctly. 

The thing is, the moveSectionUp function is not working for me when the setAutoScrolling is false! I'm pretty sure i did it wrong, but I can't figure why.. Can i have more explanation about this 2 function? Is there some conditions for them to work?

Sorry for my poor english, I'm just a french front-end developper who slept too many time in english class! My bad..

Which one are you actually using? Because the first one doesn't exist.

Also, it works as expected as you can see [in the methods example page](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/methods.html). So you are probably doing something wrong. 
Check your JavaScript console.

In any case I should point out that you don't need any external plugin at all as you can use the fullPage.js callbacks to fire the effects you want.

Thanks for a great plugin. I might need some customization, but I can write the details and get a quote from you!

Right now I have one issue. I have the following settings:

..
menu: '#menu',
css3: true,
autoScrolling: false,
scrollBar:true,
scrollingSpeed: 900,
..

If i scroll to a section longer than the current viewport and start scrolling into it, after a second or so, it will scroll up to the beginning, making it impossible to read the content. How can I avoid this?

The slimscroll plugin is very sluggerish on tablets and does not seem like a good fit for this projekt (It's the United Nations Annual Digital report, so it needs to be perfect)

Any ideas? Maybe a paid work-around?

Maybe using other plugins such as iScroll.js. Although you will lose compatibility with IE 9.

This can be implemented using the plugin's settings to add callbacks on slide transitions. Check this gist for an example: https://gist.github.com/nhylated/6a1a360a0ad321546abc

This gives a pretty decent effect even though it isn't a true cross-fade.

1289,2015-06-08 11:13:40,"Hi Alvarotrigo

I have almost finished a website for a client but I'm now almost at a standstill with regards to site performance on tablet / mobile devices (most notably Apple iOS Safari, although it works fantastically well on my android phone's chrome browser)

I understand, especially with the size of the DOM and canvas (safari apparently struggles/ crashes with anything over 20,000px in height or width), that you should expect a website to load and perform slowly.

Unfortunately the client wanted to have all website content available on first load so there is nothing we can do with regards to removing content. I have also tried/failed to introduce AJAX loaded content for each section slide too.

Temp link - www.navigatorfp.com.gridhosted.co.uk

I've tried the usual hardware accelerated but it doesn't seem to help much. If there are any CSS / Javascript tweaks that you would recommend to enhance performance that would be fantastic. :)

Much appreciated.

1289,2015-06-08 11:21:16,"First of all, make sure you are using `css3:true` (which is the default value). CSS transforms are way faster than jQuery ones.

Also, you can try using lazy load for images, videos, backgrounds and audio elements.

A new functionality for it has just been introduced in fullPage.js 2.6.6 as you can see [here](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#lazy-loading) .
For the next version I'm planning to use a `lazyDistance` option as well.

In order to lazy load backgrounds, just follow the steps I detailed [here](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/46#issuecomment-26509996).

And if you wan to use AJAX to load the sections or slides content, I don't see why you couldn't do it. 
Just combine it with callbacks such as `onLeave` or `onSlideLeave` and you'll have a good result.

Obviously I'd pay you for your dev work, even if it is to start something off for me and I can repeat the process throughout each slide. I can then possibly finish the job.

My main concern now is site loading speed as the client isn't happy with it taking more than 15 seconds to load the website each time. We are using a good host as other single pages aside from the home page (i,e. http://www.navigatorfp.com/personal-cfo) are working well. Basically we are trying to achieve a website that loads content dynamically depending on the section/slide the user is on so that it speeds up the initial first load of the website. 

I have tried a method of just having each sections first slide to load and the speed of the website loading is fantastic. In this case - Home, Who We Are, What We Do, How We Think & Where to Find Us

I would hopefully like each section to load their slides once the user has reached the parent slide (1st slide) but I have no idea where to start for this to be achievable.

1284,2015-06-05 13:48:54,"First of all thank you for your plug in.

I would like to use FullPage.js exclusively on the index page of my blog.
Because I use CodeKit the plug in’s Javascript file is prepended to my main.js and the CSS file into my SASS file.

I built up a structure following your instruction and initialize it with `$('.fullpage').fullpage({SOME_OPTION})` and everything works fine on the index page. But on a post page which either does not have the necessary structure nor the right selector for the initialization, several unwanted things are happening.
-    My console prints: `fullPage: Error! Fullpage.js needs to be initialized with a selector. For example: $('#myContainer').fullpage();`
-    The html & body get styled `style=""overflow: hidden; height: 100%;""`

This has the effect, that the page does allow scrolling. ;-(((

At the moment I don’t know what to do. When I remove the initialization everything works like expected. But when I initialize the script with an selector that does not exist on several pages, the script does unwanted things, but it just shouldn’t do anything. 

Is there any work around or do I miss something?

Best regards!

That shouldn't be happening if you use the latest version of fullpage.js (2.6.5) (and its CSS 2.6.4)

I updated your plug in via bower and changed the initialization according to your example, but the post did not scroll!

I wasn't aware about the convention to put the initialization into a condition. It works know for me, so I am fine with that.

I seem to have a problem using fullPage with google maps on a mobile environment tho. No matter how much I increase the normalScrollElementTouchThreshold, and I've also set the normalScrollElements with the div that contains the map (#map_container).
That div contains the google code for the map (the directly inside div has the class='gmap').

And what is happening is kind of strange; Since the map is the last vertical page of the fullPage and it has no scrolls to the sides, I can scroll it to the sides and down, and if I start by doing that I can also move it up until I lift my finger.

I love fullPage and i wish use it for my personnal web page.

I'm trying to integrate a fixed left side menu but i've some trouble with the scrolling inside the menu when the mouse is over the menu.
On load, with the first section or the third section active, without slide, i can scroll the menu with mousewheel when i'm over it.

http://numeridome.fr/fullpage-vMenu-scroll/#secondPage/1

If i slide on right by the right arrow after the last slide, the scrolling came back normally.

i have tried a lot of way but that doesn't work anyway...

is it a bug or i do something wrong ?

1277,2016-09-07 08:16:21,"Hi alvarotrigo

I can confirm we have also observed this behaviour in release 2.8.4. To test, we rolled back to version 2.6.6. This fixed the bug (but it introduced other issues which were undesirable for us).

Our method to reproduce:
1. If we start with a full screen page, on the first section (starting on any other section will not produce this bug).
2. We reduce the size of the page. (Our page uses OnResize to setAutoScrolling(false); below a certain size)
3. We maximise the window and reset setAutoScrolling(true);
4. Now the mousewheel and touchscroll doesn't work for scrolling until you use the down arrow.

Our workaround has been to add a null section. at the start of our page which is non-navigable.

Sorry, I'm sure this is a really quirky one for you to pin down.

You shouldn't be doing this. 
Use the options `responsiveWidth` or `responsiveHeight`. 

I do not provide support for any old version of fullpage.js anyways.  (this is, less than 2.8.6)
",alvarotrigo,2015-06-08 10:59:57
1277,2016-09-08 01:09:52,"Hi alvarotrigo

Thanks for the info. We are already using responsiveWidth and responsiveHeight in our solution on initialisation... sorry that was assumed. However we found that it didn't always switch mode in every resize scenario on every browser. This is why we do both. We force the interchange regardless of the scenario. It could that the two issues are interrelated. We're using horizontal sections, vertical slides and have a page that on moderate sized resolutions needs to vertically scroll, before we drop into responsive. This means we have both page based auto scrolling and in slide manual scrolling.

Happy to say the issue is way way we're using your framework, or that we're leaving the boundaries for which it was designed, but we can't pin it down yet.

That said we'll integrate 2.8.6 into our next build, run a battery of tests and let you know the outcome.

The [responsive height](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/1256) option is a proposed enhancement I did myself.

Checking the `height` inside the plugin initialization doesn't seem very reasonable. It wouldn't work on viewport resizing. 

It seems to me adding a function  `setResponsive(boolean)` can be more useful for that. 
This way you would be able to apply the responsiveness whenever you want (on mobile phone, under certain condition...).

Check the responsive-Example, I've edited it to clarify the use of a function for this use case (however, I've only read the width as in the original one).

Right. My mistake :D I don't know what was I thinking about.

The only problem I see with this method, although it seems useful, is that people with a basic knowledge of javascript might have troubles using it.

I love your script, and used it for my website. with pagepiling.js, but since it doesn't support for the mobile to scroll on long section i was looking for a solution. and then, now I found this fullpage.js that has the scrollable feature working perfectly.

I found that, that pinch thing works totally fine on ""normal scroll demo"". 
and I found fullpage's feature that automatically moves the section to fit on the screen after a few seconds. 

So I think , if I could setup that 'a few seconds' like 0.1 millie secs, and then make that 'fitting-to-the screen-feature' to active immediately after touch fingers are off the screen. 

I imagine this would, work pretty much like non-normal-scroll-demo pages, but I can still use the pinch zoom, and double finger events...

You can not place anything in there... just a value (600, 900...).

From the docs:

> **responsive:** (default 0) A normal scroll (autoScrolling:false) will be used under the defined width in pixels. A class fp-responsive is added to the plugin's container in case the user wants to use it for his own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's width is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site.

This works in Chrome and Firefox, but not in any version of IE. 

the markup for my buttons looks like this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The Javascript on the page looks like this:

Does anyone know why the links don't work in IE?

Thanks for your help,

1249,2015-05-25 13:00:07,"You are not using normal links with anchors. You are adding a new URL with parameters in it: `?form-name=form+2`.

It seems IE is deleting the anchors in the URL when submitting the form. 
That has nothing to do with fullPage.js.

I discovered a bug.

If the website contains a link or a form when you press the ""tab"" key, the browser goes directly to the section concerned but the navigation is completely broken.
",meneldil,
1237,2015-05-21 12:37:33,"Yeah right. 
I was aware of it. 

The only solution is not simple... [Depending on the browser](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1600194/1081396) some elements are able to receive the focus on `tab` and others don't.

In order to prevent it, fullPage.js would have to set `tabIndex=""-1""` to any of those elements outside the current section plus any element containing the attribute `tabindex`.
And if you have many links or inputs in your site, this could decrease the performance of your site on every section / slide change. 

The other option is just to disable the tab in fullPage.js. Or you manually setting tabindex to `-1`.
",alvarotrigo,
1237,2015-05-21 13:25:17,"A quick fix we implemented was this...

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This basically does what alarotrigo said and disables tabbing globally on the page... We actually just got a complaint from a client saying that they couldn't tab through this one form so you might be getting a pull request if I can find a decent solution, but as you said it might affect performance if there are a ton of elements...
",ZackMattor,
1237,2015-05-21 13:51:06,"You can also set the wrapper of those elements to `display:none` or I believe you can even use `opacity:0` and probably...  `visibility: hidden`. This way you will only have to show the form on `onLeave` or just use the active class in the section to make it visible:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
",alvarotrigo,
1237,2015-05-21 13:55:11,"I'll keep looking into this issue. 
It might be able to be solved by using `opacity:0` for all the non visible sections. I believe that's the way [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js) deals with it.
Although they have a pretty ugly interval [here](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/js/reveal.js#L582) to solve problems with iframes. (you can actually test it by setting `opacity:1` to the next slide, you'll notice how it comes back after _tabbing_ )

1229,2015-05-19 15:39:18,"Hello,

I searched the GitHub issues but couldn't come up with a proper solution by myself.

I am trying to put a full page Div above the fullPage site that has to be scrollable. It is `positon:fixed` so that it can bee seen from any fullPage section the user is calling it. 

It displays a collection of image thumbnails – clicking on a thumbnail navigates the user to the matching fullPage section (scenario: Gallery & Gallery overview).

What I did so far to achieve this:
1. I gave the div a css `positon:fixed` and `overflow:scroll` value
2. I put the div ID into the fullPage `fixedElements` value
3. When the Div is shown, the fullPage scrolling in the background is disabled via `$.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(false, 'up, down, left, right');`

The Div is being display on top of fullPage now – but not scrollable. So:
1. additionally I put the Div ID into the fullPage `normalScrollElements` value. The Div becomes scrollable now, but so does the fullPage wrapper in the background again.

What am I doing wrong? How can I handle the fullPage site and the Div (Gallery-Thumbnail-view) separately, so that fullPage is temporarily disabled while the Div in the foreground is visible?

Best,
Gregor

1226,2015-05-18 11:36:04,"Hey, just wanted to share how to do this. 

I'm working on a site where every section has two child-divs `.half`. In my case the child divs have 50% width, 100% height of the section. And they have content with different heights. So I need to be able to scroll inside those divs and when I reached the bottom of either divs, fullpage-js needs to go to the next section.

The problem: 
When you activate slimscroll with fullpage.js, then it will scroll both divs instead of just one.

The solution:
Don't use slimscroll with fullpage.js, but initialize it yourself. In each `.half` you will need an inner div that contains your content `.fp-scrollable`. Initialize slimscroll by yourself like this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

We need the class `fp-scrollable`, this way your slimscroll containers will be compatible with fullpage.js.
You may need to resize the slimscroll containers on window resize.

1220,2015-07-12 14:09:01,"Thanks Alvaro for the quick response. Your example would work fine for predefined background images written in a CSS stylesheet but I'll have to figure out a way of making this work with ""background-image"" references in inline HTML, as my background images are being inserted via shortcodes in Wordpress and that requires use of inline declarations. But perhaps I'm missing something in your example :)

Failing that I might rewrite my shortcode plugin to have `<img>` elements placed absolutely on the page, and have the page content sit on top of it, to simulate a background image setup, while getting the benefit of the data-src attribute.

1220,2015-07-13 15:12:27,"Just for the benefit of anyone wanting a solution, I have made something here that takes `data-src` attributes and assigns them to the background-image property of a section DIV. It uses CSS3 transitions to fade in each section panel upon completion of the image load. It 'sort of' works for slides (I can't get the first slide to fade in, because I don't think there isn't a callback for that event, eg onSlideLoad). This also means the first image of any slider gets preloaded along when the page renders, along with the visible section on page. But this works fine otherwise.

I might solve it in a future, but the solution may not be what you expect. The only way I see to solve it is by forcing 700 milliseconds delay between you arrive to one section/slide until you can do any other action.
This is how this plugin worked in a past and [I got many complains about that behavior](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/333).

I guess you mean, by using the `anchors` option.

That's what anchors are for... there's an animation that moves it from the 1st section to the one given in the URL anchor. Unless you set `animateAnchor:false`, the animation will be visible. You can test it on the [demo page](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/).

That's because you are not making use of the option `scrollOverflow:true` that deals automatically with that problem as you can see [in this demo](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/scrolling.html).

Therefore, you should be using the option `normalScrollElements` and apply it to your scrollable content.

1155,2015-04-17 10:37:39,"In `onSlideLeave(anchorLink, index, slideIndex, direction)`, the value of `direction` is the scrolling direction, not the key pressed by the user.

When on the first (left-most) slide and pressing 'left', the scrolling direction becomes 'right'; when on the first slide and pressing 'right', the scrolling direction becomes 'right'. Similarly, when on the last (right-most) slide and pressing 'right', the scrolling direction becomes 'left'; when on the last slide and pressing 'left', the scrolling direction becomes 'left'.

Thus, with the information currently provided in `onSlideLeave`, there is no way of telling which key the user has pressed. The `direction` can come about because the user pressed that key or because slides are ""spooling back"".

I am trying to update the content displayed in a navigation bar, based on slide transitions. With the information in `onSlideLeave`, this is not possible, because it is unknown whether the user really pressed 'right'; or the user actually pressed 'left' on the first slide and, because of that, slides are spooling back to the right.

The function signature should be changed to

`onSlideLeave(anchorLink, index, slideIndex, scrollingDirection, key)`

where `scrollingDirection` is the value of the current `direction` and `key` is either `'left'` or `'right'`, depending on which key the user pressed.

1155,2015-04-21 08:15:56,"Sorry for the wait. I have solved the problem using several slick sliders instead of a combination of slick and fullPage.

For an explanation of the problem, see my original posting. When using fullPage only, it is not necessary to know which key has been pressed, because fullPage will take care of showing the right slide. However, when fullPage needs to be combined with other controls, such as a slick slider, then it is necessary to know into which direction the user intends to move, i.e. which key has been pressed. FullPage does not provide that information because it will move into a single direction, independently of whether it is moving to the next slide or looping after reaching an edge.

Providing the intended direction of movement in fullPage does make sense in my opinion. Especially, when fullPage should be combined with other controls that need to change based on the direction of movement.

Still, I have found a better way of solving this, fullPage has not been the ideal candidate for what I am trying to do - I am fine with closing this issue.

I'm not sure [if slimScroll provides anyway to access to a certain part of the scrollable area](https://github.com/rochal/jQuery-slimScroll/issues/98), but even in case it does, you would need to modify the plugin the parse the anchor string (#what-we-do/client-reviews/#steven) and get only the last bit (#steven).
And then very probably you'll have to calculate the position of the element containing that anchor inside the scrollable element to pass it to slimScroll.

You probably can do all of this by just forcing the scroll of the scrollable element and then manually moving its scrollbar to the right position.

the fullPage.js plugin as great!

I've just noticed that while performing slide transition the plugin doesn't round transition values:

- that's a screenshot for completed slide animation. This may cause **blurry text** on slide, so does it in my case.

You don't need to. fullPage.js does it automatically when using anchors as you can see on the [demo page](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/).
If you dont want the scrolling animation, then use the option `animateAnchor:false` (which works for the vertical animation).

> animateAnchor: (default true) Defines whether the load of the site when given an anchor (#) will scroll with animation to its destination or will directly load on the given section.

Keep in mind as well that the active section or slide will have the class `active`. You can also check the class `fp-viewing-x-x` added to the body of the page.

1145,2015-04-15 09:04:30,"Read the [FAQs](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/wiki/FAQ---Frequently-Answered-Questions).

> **Short answer:** use the scrollBar:true option for fullPage.js or autoScrolling:false if you don't want to use the auto-scrolling feature.
> 
> **Explanation:** Parallax, **as well as many other plugins which depends on the scrolling of the site**, listens the scrollTop property of javascript. fullPage.js doesn't actually scroll the site but it changes the top or translate3d property of the site. Only when using the fullPage.js option scrollBar:true or autoScrolling:false it will actually scroll the site in a way it is accessible for the scrollTop property.

In any case, you wouldn't need to use any external plugin for it... you can just use the callbacks fullPage.js provides or even the class fullpage.js adds to the body to play with CSS just as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiCVPpI9l3M).

I have read through some of the scrollOverflow/normalScroll related issues, and dont think Ive come across this case. Within each fullpage section i have an overlay section set to 100% of the section. The normal scrolling is set for the overlay div and works fine on safari, slows sluggishly on firefox, and doesnt scroll at all on Chrome. The scroll bars dont show up either.

Here are my settings:
        anchors: panels,
        fixedElements: '#fixed-nav-bar',
        paddingTop: '60px',
        responsive: 1030,

1134,2016-04-07 17:18:18,"I think I've came to a partial solution. it's not great code as I'm not a programmer and it requires a bit of personalization but it seems to work.

you can see a demo here: http://lemonskin.net/test/fullPage_horizontal/apps/test.html

You need to declare some variables inside your javascript section:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Paste this code inside the call function:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The only problem with this solution is that side-dots navigation doesn't work, as I can't find a way to distinguish the change of page between arrows/mousewheel and clicks. My function can only calcolate previous and next page/slide. It can't make jumps, as they should have a direct command like moveTo(section, slide).
Maybe Alvaro could have an idea about it.

I still think that a better solution would be to intercept the horizontal scrolling of mouse, but that's totally out of my capacities (I've tried a couple of jquery utilities that should do that but my coding was a disaster). :(

It doesn't seem to be a good solution. Percentages should work just fine, as it is done in the pure javascript version.

Regarding the drop of javascript or jQuery, that's impossible nowadays. The plugin is already making use of CSS3 to perform animations, and that's as much as you can do with CSS nowadays.

CSS won't be able to deal with mouse / touch events or anything requiring a bit of logic. And neither HTML5. 
That's why javascript is there and that's why javascript is still being used nowadays. CSS and HTML5 are not replacements of javascript. 
Regarding animations, CSS has improved with version 3, but still not being able to deal with logic.

1129,2015-04-07 13:50:41,"Hello Alvaro,

First off, kudos for the plugin! It's awesome !
How would you suggest achieving scrolling on a div that is inside a slide ?

I have a layout that is split in two halfs : one has an image and another has text.
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7666090/7023935/e9e7e642-dd41-11e4-879b-b088adf61e62.png)
The text can vary in length but the image should always be visible fully. 

What i've done so far but it's buggy : i've set a special class for the divs that have text, added that class to normalScrollElements option and i've applied the slimscroll plugin to that class. 
Also i've added custom js, which listens to the slimscroll event to detect when the scroll bar has reached top or bottom, and if the user is still scrolling, fire the coresponding $.fn.fullpage.moveSectionUp or Down.

The issue is that because I have multiple slides being generated and some content areas are shorter than the height set for the scrolling to appear, when i mouse over the content area and try to scroll, nothing happens. The expected behaviour would be to advance to the next / previous slide, depending on scroll direction.

Any suggestions ?

That's the way to do it. 
Now I guess you have to detect if there's a scroll bar or not, and if not, scroll up or down a section.

Also as i mentioned in the second comment, when scrolling is triggered by movesectionup i noticed that if i don't move the mouse, nothing happens.
So I guess what I need to detect is not so easy as checking for the scrollbar (which by the way is always present in the DOM but is not shown if it's height is equal to the text containing div's height)

Use the slimScroll version included in fullPage.js.

In any case, this question doesn't regard any issue with fullPage.js but a specific problem of your own. I would recommend you to ask in other place. 

Fullpage.js provides a way to create a scrolling bar in any slide or section by using the option `scrollOverflow:true` as you can see [in this example](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/scrolling.html).

1. setAllowScrolling didn't use the first supplied direction

I found that when supplying two directions to SetAllowScrolling only the second one was being applied. So I replaced the code with the following:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This worked with touch events but still didn't stop the page from scrolling using mouse or keyboard, so I did this:
1. modify function MouseWheelHandler
   
   <S_CODE_TOKEN>

This still didn't stop the page from scrolling using mouse or keyboard, so I did this:
1. Modify scrollPage:

Adding the following into function scrollPage blocks the movement as it is supposed to do:

1112,2015-03-27 01:19:49,"Hi,

Thank you for your the great plugin. However i ran into some issues with the plugin. Below i have detailed all the necessary steps for your reproduce.

Problems:
1. In reference to the scrolling.html file that you have as the example. Which can be found from the examples you provided.
1. I tried loading this to an iPad to test things out, as that is where the it mostly be used, however, the transition is very jittery, which caused the user experience to drop. And it does not retain the AutoScroll snappy transition in between each sections. 

Solutions i have tried:

I have tried several solutions to solve this issue, however, none of them worked, as it produces a different problem, below is a list of things i have tried.
1. I have tried using normalScrollElements to make an exception for the elements and class to retain its normal scrolling functions, however it does not work at all, and the autoScroll is still true regardless.
2. I have tried using the callback functions afterLoad(), to change the autoScroll property from true to false in the section that requires scrolling and combining with onLeave() function, to return the autoScroll property to true to return back to the previous section with the snappy transition. However, this does not work, as the image in the first section will not align properly when the autoScroll is set to false, and returning it to true will cause the transition to have a major lag, which cause everything to not perform smoothly.
3. I tried using fitToSection function as well, however, this will cause the content to be centred and do not display all of the content.

An overview of the ideal solution will be like the following: 
Section 1 = autoScroll is true
Section 2 = Have normal scrolling capabilities, as the content will not fit in an iPad screen and when scrolling back to Section 1 will have the snappy transition that the autoScroll provides.

Please advise. I have attached screenshots of Section 1 and 2 of what it looks like.

If that's not working well for you, I'm afraid there's no proper solution for it. I would recommend you to use the `responsive` option to set he page to `autoScrolling:false` once reached certain `width`, or, otherwise, use CSS3 media queries or responsive techniques such as [FlowType](https://github.com/simplefocus/FlowType.JS) for text resizing.

In Chrome, the video flashes as a square briefly before clipping into a circle, in safari it simple refuses to clip.

You can change the speed by using the option `scrollingSpeed` and then you can apply the effects or animatinos on the callback `onLeave` so you can see their transitions just whenever you leave the section and they can keep playing until you decide to stop them, so they will be visible during the scrolling as well.

You will need to use javascript and the ajax technique to do it.

The only thing you might need to know that can be related with fullpage.js is that if you want to use `scrollOverflow`, then you would need to call the `reBuild` function after you load the content into the section, so fullPage.js can calculate the size to the new content and determine whether to use an scroll bar or not, and which size should it have.

Not sure if it's okay to ask here, but could your kindly clarify if
using fixed headers will affect the height of the slide divs(`<div class=""slide"">`)?
I am trying to get the slide div to occupy the remaining space up to
the fixed header but it would seem that the div can't be moved(the blue border).

1099,2015-03-22 22:54:50,"Hi!

Love the plugin, I just have one question. I have a site, where my main sections are fullwidth, and when I click on one of them, a second section opens up to the right. The main one where the fullPage scroll is, shrinks to 60% of the page, and the right one is 40%. 

Now, several things are worrying me. First, even if the right div is visible, when I scroll down, my left section scrolls. That's probably because you binded some kind of mouse scroll event to it? I am wondering is it possible to limit that scroll only when the slide is on full width (I am controlling that via css and by adding the class on it on click)?

Also When I 'open' the right div, even tho it's height is greater then the window height, I cannot scroll it. I tried with `overflow-y:scroll` but nothing happened, It just scrolls the left div (the one with fullPage working on it). Is there some workaround? 

Thanks :)

You can use the option `normalScrollElements` or rather use the function `setAllowScrolling('false')`.

How would you break it? Not quite sure to understand it. A proper compression should provide the exact same results as the non minified version. In the case of using CSS, by just removing whitespaces, indentation and line jumps.

Uploaded by a human being who compressed said files on their own, which I don't want to do any more, esp for someone like you who publishes new versions almost weekly (which is a good thing).

I'm not expecting you to compress by hand either; do you use a build tool?

This would be the safest compression; perhaps the bot should do that?

When working on my project and trying to declare anchors .... I keep on having this problem where when anchors are declared they end up screwing up my page and skipping the second section during scrolling. Therefore I did some tests on previous projects of my and they cause the same problems too.

Eg. anchors [ 'home', 'about', 'history', 'gallery', 'contact us' ] ..... once this is done, the webpage would skip section 2 when scrolling ... anyhow, after taking the anchor initialization out ... the problem is gone.

1085,2015-03-17 10:09:43,"As far as I know, backbone is similar to Angular. When dealing with this frameworks you have to be careful of how many times you initialize a plugin, as this is one of the common problems people have initializing per content loaded (per link users click).

You should be playing with the function `$.fn.fullpage.destroy('all')` and the initialization. So whenever you load a new fullpage.js page (if that's the case), you should destroy fullpage.js (if it was initialized before) and then initialize it again.
If you load a new content which doesn't require fullpage.js, then you just need to destroy fullpage.js to liberate the events used by it (mousewheel, scroll, touch...).

I'm using your awesome plugin to create a website for my gym. But having problem on making navigation items active . My website consists of 3 navigation menus . Main Menu , Services Menu and Contact Menu . And all of active statements for different navigation bars are working correctly. 

But ,there is a problem on a Page Slide Section which consists of two slides . One is for Location and when clicked to the arrow in the right it appears a Contact Slide Part . 
This section has it's uniqe navigation , consisting of two navbar items , Location and Contact . 

When i move to the first slide it's correctly showing me the active state of navbar item , which in this case it's Location . Then i slide to the right part , in the Contact section , it removes the li's first-child active state and ataches to this Navbar item . 

The problem is that , when i go  back to left slide , it doesn't remove the active statement from that slide and neither makes the Location slide navbar item active . 

Here's my code . 

afterLoad: function(anchorLink, index){
                var loadedSection = $(this);

1071,2015-03-10 22:21:54,"Hello,

I'm trying to build a Phonegap project with fullpage.js, but I have some difficulties with scrollable sections.

This is what I need :
A first section with an horizontal slider, which contains a background picture and a title.
A second (and last) section with another slider, with the content, height will vary, so the slide must be scrollable.
Between the scenes : swipe up/down and swipe left/right.

My problem is on the second section : I don't want to use the slimScroll plugin, because the scrolling experience is bad on a mobile ( slow, and no momentum)
I tried the fix with afterSlideLoad found on this page http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21817799/scrollbar-on-active-slide-for-overflowing-content-with-fullpage-js but with no result...

Do you know how can I make the last section scrollable,  or how can I use another plugin (like iScroll.js for example) with Fullpage.js ?

1066,2015-03-09 12:02:15,"I can see it useful mainly in terms of compression, but the reason of making it easier to change doesn't convince me. It is almost as easy as using a ""find an replace"" and I don't see this variables as something that will be changed with frequency. 

In any case, I would use real constants instead of objects, this way you could save more then 2KB (10%) in the minification and the syntax will be shorter and more easy to read. 
I'm not either sure either of how to deal with the classNames variables. Having them by duplicate doesn't seem very reasonable. 
A function could be used for it, but it would make the code more difficult to read and to be written.

Not having ""magic"" strings all over the code helps with maintainability, refactoring, lessens the risk of typos/regressions, and could help contributers (and with taking contributions) as all the DOM selectors are now easily glance-able.

Though do agree that using raw vars (consts) would help the minification much more.

1066,2015-03-09 14:52:03,"@eamodio yeah. I agree with you. Although I believe some of those strings shouldn't be constants, such as:
- body 
-  #fp-nav li
-  #fp-nav li a
- .fp-tableCell, .fp-slidesContainer
- #fp-nav, .fp-slidesNav, .fp-controlArrow
- .fp-controlArrow.fp-next
- .fp-controlArrow.fp-prev

Having combinations of selectors which are only used in specific cases, such as the `controls` one (`'#fp-nav, .fp-slidesNav, .fp-controlArrow`) doesn't seem to be very useful for me when they can done by combining those constants. 
I see it useful though for other cases such as `activeSlide` or `activeSection` which are widely used.

Then, not quite sure about the other combinations such as `sectionNavLinks:    '#fp-nav a',`...

Ok. Fine then.

Should we just name the constants with upper cases without any prefix suffix to make them shorter and easier to read while coding?

For example: `$(ACTIVE_SLIDE)`

What about the class names? Should we just use a function for it?

What do you think about it?
It wouldn't look as clear in the code, but can't think about anything else.

1066,2015-03-09 20:46:06,"Using CAPS for the constants sounds good. But I would argue against using a function for conversion from selector to class or vice versa. My main argument would be around performance and the amount of strings that would get allocated and destroyed, which would put more pressure on the garbage collector. Causing more collections could cause more pauses in the experience.

I would suggest to just use un-prefixed CAPS variables for classes and prefixed (or post-fixed) CAPS variables for selectors that are the combination of the class variables.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

or

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I believe that would play well for readability, minification, and performance.

Thoughts?

> Closure Compiler assumes that you are using gzip compression. If you do not, you should. Configuring your server to gzip your code is one of the most effective and easiest optimizations that you can possibly do. The gzip algorithm works by trying to alias sequences of bytes in an optimal way. Aliasing strings manually almost always makes the compressed code size bigger, because it subverts gzip's own algorithm for aliasing. So Closure Compiler will (almost) always inline your strings when it can, because that will make your compressed code smaller.

Each of my sections has several slides which can flip using CSS3 transform animations. I wonder if my content is too heavy for the sections to load quickly and I wonder if anything can be done to improve performance.

When set to true, your content will be wrapped by the plugin. Consider using delegation or load your other scripts in the afterRender callback.

The problem is – it is no possibility to scroll to content under fullPage-controlled content, e.g. footer.
Made some dirty workaround which, I guess, can be picked up, refactored, and baked into a library by maintainer.
In jquery.fullPage.js, scrollHandler function, after `scrollId2 = setTimeout(function(){` put this: (prevent execution if plugin is destroyed)

Then, my dirty code looks as follows (slides are `.visual`):

However, I believe not all the referenced posts try to do that. Some of them them just try to keep scrolling as fullPage.js does but even when the content below is not a full page section and it doesn't fit the whole viewport.

1025,2015-12-15 17:55:27,"Good evening Alvaro.

I'm using the new version but the problem continues.
There are 2 problems:
1.  Setting the ""autoScrolling"" false, using a ""fp-auto-height"" section in the page, in mobiles the vertical vertical scroll doesn't work, only works if ""autoScrolling"" is true, but works like """"autoScrolling"" works, it means scrolling section by section.
2. The fullpage becomes a little bit crazy if the ""fp-auto-height"" is used between 2 normal sections, for example: I have a content higher or smaller than the screen size, I don't want to use the scroll option so I set false the fitToSection and autoScrolling, but the menu buttons don't recognize the top of the section if you click on a button to go to the section (#section-one) with ""fp-auto-height"" it will takes you to the middle of the section or you will see a little bit of the others sections on the top. I think it should work like a normal anchor.

hope you can understand what I mean.

1. look the second slide, is a ""fp-auto-height"" just be sure that the preview square is smaller than the second slide. I understand that the class ""fp-auto-height"" behavior, because the scroll takes you to the button of the section (like in the footer) but that behavior doesn't in this case that the content is bigger than the screen and overflow is disable.

I think a good idea is create an ""fp-auto-height-top"" to scroll to the top of the auto-height section, or set parameters that recognise the height of the section, if is higher than the view port, scroll to the top or simply, always scroll to the top because if is on the footer the scroll can't go further than the en of the page.

 I am trying to hide the dotted vertical navigation bar from the first section only. Through the support on this forum, I have got a solution by implementing the following code on the site I am working on:

afterLoad: function(anchorLink, index) { // you need to add the parameters
    navColor();
    addClassNav();
    // $('#fp-nav').fadeIn(); 
    section.not('.active').find('.section-content').mCustomScrollbar('scrollTo', 'top');
    videoBg();
    setTimeout(function() {
        sandwichAnimation();
    }, 0);
    // simply ask fullpage for section index:
    if (index === 1) {

It appears when you load the page, but once you scroll down then up it disappears. And even sometimes it disappears when you load the page.

when u say, the navi appears when u load the page, then it seems to me, that you maybe forgot to add display: none to #fp-nav in your css for initial #fp-nav invisibility directly after the page rendered.

When I use 2 fingers with default-config firefox, I seems to emulate a normal touchpad! two fingers = mousewheel.

Touch events where deactivated by mozilla because of bugginess (text selection instead touch-events). You have to activate touch events in the about:config section but even then they are buggy and swiping won't work, which seems to be a firefox problem - not yours.

But this also means, that windows firefox users with touch devices have no touch-functionality with your script.

So... how do you usually scroll a webpage with firefox if the touch functionality doesn't work?
Does it work as a scroll event instead?
",alvarotrigo,

https://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/MonitorEvents

I believe that firefox has its own way to deal with touch events. maybe the touch events never reach the DOM.

I made myself this fiddle (don't kill me :D I am more the designer type) to test the polyfill I talked about and no finger combination whatsoever triggers touchstart. everything in firefox (even 10 fingers) is mouse ;)

Nop. Be careful with that, that's the first click of the mouse. If you change it to 1 it will scroll when clicking in a desktop computer as well.

I though Firefox would use the middle button (number 2) which is the one used when you click down in the mouse wheel instead of scrolling it.
It doesn't make much sense to use the 1st click because as you say, it will select the text of the site.

Is this the normal behaviour with any other site in your touch screen when using Firefox? Does the text get selected when scrolling?
",alvarotrigo,
1016,2015-02-16 21:06:43,"yeah and also it breaks ie11 I just found out :D. nope that is no normal behavior. ""normal"" pages can be scrolled with 1-finger-touch without selecting any content. to select text you need to double-tab in firefox.

1016,2015-02-17 10:35:22,"I think you can't do a thing. I just checked github with firebug event monitor. When you touch the screen in firefox with one finger a mouseout gets fired and that's it. After that mouseout there is event silence. No touchstart, no touchmove, mousemove etc. When you swipe sideways you get mousemoves but with classic up- and downswipe there is just silence.

I'm starting to believe, that mozilla has its own shitty control-layer on top of the DOM, which interprets certain gestures.

As long as mozilla doesn't get its act together with that nasty touch-bug, I'm beginning to think, there is nothing to be done anymore.

1016,2015-02-18 15:05:55,"@tripletto tell me see if I understood it correctly:
- Firefox touch event detection is disabled by default (so no touch events are recorded)
- Firefox on a touch screen computer can still scroll with a single finger swipe in any site with the default settings. (this is, without the use of touch events)
- The `mousewheel` or `wheel` event fired is not fired when swiping with a single finger.

Also, have you tried it from any other computer with Firefox and touch screen? Just to make sure the problem is not in your own computer.

The metro-thingy means that there are two ui-modes in windows (totally stupid – everyone hates it). The metro-UI is the touch-only part of windows, which has its own set of applications. one of them was firefox-metro which was pulled early 2014 because nobody (1000 people tops) was using it.

About your solution... I would say that's not the best one. CSS3 improves a lot the performance of the movements (and a lot as well in Mobile devices) and probably very few people is suffering from your same problem as you are. 
Take into account that the problem is affecting ALL css3 transformations in any website in the world. If the problem was experienced by many people they should have fix it already and probably they wouldn't even have released it in the users stable version of Chrome, very probably just in Canary.

New to this so don't eat me alive :). Really loving fullPage.js for a project I'm working on now but I'm encountering a bug with the ease affect on the gradient example. The background fades very nicely for the first three sections but after I add anymore it stops easing and displays the change as a single non-easing line. 

For example if my first three sections are 0,1,2 and I add a section 3 <div> the background will be the correctly assigned color, but the change is instant and no longer eases. Any thoughts on this?

There's no way to define what a tablet or a phone is. So you'd better clear your mind about why you want to have a non autoscrolling site for ""mobile phones and tablets"". 
If its a matter of resolution, then use it as a way to differentiate both and based on that, use one or another initialization. 

The plugin can't just know what you mean with ""tablet or phone"". It provides the option `responsive` to turn on the normal scrolling based on the `width`. So you can start with that if its a matter of resolution.

 I just realized there is an issue. Now when the page loads the vertical nav bar is disappeared which is what I wanted, but when the page is refreshed, the vertical nav bar comes again as the link has an anchor #intro. e.g. domainname.com/#intro where the ""intro"" is the first section in the website where I want to disable the vertical nav.

- The screen will scroll to the top of the active section

When I load/refresh the page the first dot has the ""active"" class but once scrolling starts it is removed and the other links don't get any classes.

These are my settings:

I'm updating the title of your issue to a better one.

The issue takes place only when using `scrollBar:true` without providing the `anchors` option.

In any case, you should review your initialization, the `menu` option can never be set to `true`.

973,2015-01-26 21:43:55,"Hi

I’m trying to get a website working with requirejs. It works fine in most systems and in most of the browsers. But it fails (combined with scrollmagic and other stuff) in safari on random system versions (iMac, non-retina mbp) and random safari versions (occurred in safari 6, 7 and 8).

While I don’t know the reason for this behavior, I try to catch every mistake.

I’m not sure about the right implementation of your plugin in requirejs. Is it possible to write a module-like use of your plugin? In addition to this I’m not sure how to skip unused variables and if the use of domReady (I tried it with and without—same behaviour) is an advantage or not.

Best

I want my first page to have one background and the pages to the left and right to have a different background.

You are not suppose to use `normalScrollElements` for a section element. This is not the purpose of it, and less if you are using `scrollBar:true`.

You can try to solve it by using `scrollOverflow:true` as in [this example](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/scrolling.html) but you will have then 2 scroll bars...

I have this strange issue. I create a class, basically it doesn't matter, but let say I want a class or an id for a text container. If I add the text container in the first section it looks great and it sticks with the section or the slide of that section, but if I want to add it to another section, 2nd or 3rd etc, it appears on the first section only. 

What do I have to do in order to be able to put a class/id on any other section than the 1st one. 

You can check a demo here to see what I am talking about.
http://jsfiddle.net/cbalasa/6SQhb/40/

The white rectangle is put in the 2d section but it appears on the first section above those 3 slides in the 1st section. If you copy/paste the rectangle in the first section it looks ok and it sticks with the correct slide.

Can you test again with repeating scroll screen left and right several times? I agree with you that  the problem is caused by image loading. But I can't figure out why the bug still exist when I scroll back to the same page that the image has finishes loading.
the place that white blink happen is opposite with scrolling direction. For example , I scroll right direction go to left page, the white blink will happen on left side of the screen.

958,2015-01-15 05:47:16,"I would like to use fullPage.js and it's autoScrolling feature on my site but there's one thing making me not using it.

When using 'responsive: value' the 'autoScrolling' feature is being turned off. The problem is that the 'scrollOverflow' feature remains unchanged from original. 

Would it be possible to turn off 'scrollOverflow' when 'responsive: value' is triggered? The reason I would like to do that is because I don't want to scroll within the '.section' in responsive mode, I just want it to act normal just like as if 'scrollOverflow' was turned off.

So basically;
How do I turn off 'scrollOverflow' when 'responsive' is triggered? It's very much needed for my design and I think it could be helpful for other too.

I would like fullPage.js with the features 'autoScrolling' and 'scrollOverflow' to be enabed above the responsive breakpoint. But when 'responsive' triggers I want 'autoScrolling' and 'scrollOverflow' turned off, both of them.

957,2015-01-15 05:37:20,"Mainly using fullPage.js for the easy way to get sections to take up 100% height and center the content vertically. Would use it for the autosSrolling-feature too if the support for overflowing content would be greater. 

However, to my problem.

To ensure 100% functionality across different platforms/screen sizes I've decided to turn autoScrolling off. However, the autoScrolling is activated once the browser gets new dimensions. 

For example, on computer: 
Loading the page the scrolling is normal (autoScrolling: false). Resizing the browser window to ""mobile size"" it's still behaving like 'autoScrolling: false'. However, going back to the original size again will activate the autoScrolling feature even though it's set to 'false' in the code.

On a mobile device the same thing is happening, however when screen orientation is being triggered the first time. So if visiting the site and turning your phone/tablet (triggering the auto rotate screen) the autoScrolling feature will be activated and the site will behave badly (because it's not been designed for it).

What is causing this? This is not the cause of my own HTML/CSS/JS as it is happening in the fullPage.js examples too.

I could shoot a video of this if needed.

After fiddling around a bit with fullpage.js, I encountered a little problem which can be reproduced with your demo. 

Assume we have 3 or more sections. When I scroll from the first section (0) to the second section (1) and I then decide to go back to the first section via browser back button, the browser back-button won't work. The first section is missing its anchor / hashtag.

I fiddled a bit around and thought I could use your afterLoad-callback to add the missing anchor like this, so the browser navigation buttons will work from the first section on: 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The problem I ran into was, afterLoad seems to work only from 2nd section on upwards. The principle was tried out with afterRender and works but isn't very usefull because of deeplinking and stuff...

So i guess I would need something along the lines of

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

So one could check if the first section is active and if so give it the missing hashtag. Does that make sense to you or am I totally stupid? :D Is there a method to do this that I have overlooked?

I can not reproduce the problem [in the demo page](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/navigationV.html). The bug I can find is related with scrolling more than one section when scrolling once by using an Apple trackpad.

When clicking on the right nav randomly in rapid succession, the page will be brought to the appropriate section and then prevent you from scrolling until you've clicked on the nav again to go to another section.

You would need to initialize fullPage.js again if you use `destroy('all')`.

So, on smaller screens where the content can't be shown all at once, when the user scrolls down to see the content, he or she might _overscroll_ (via mouse or touch pad) and instead of just scrolling to see the content trigger the new page slide in as well, so the user can't read the content and has to go back.

One solution might be too change the content structure and add some padding or empty space below the actual content, but that seems like crude solution. 

Is there a way to solve this so in the initial scroll, when the user is actually scrolling the page which has height larger than the screen/window height, doesn't trigger the scroll event?

941,2015-01-04 13:42:38,"Sorry for opening the already discussed issue. I did try to find similar issues but was overwhelmed with questions and didn't try that exact wording while searching.

Do you think its possible to solve this in this way:
- detect is the height of the page larger than the current height of the window
- if so, temporarily disable the plugin
- after scrolling, check is the end of the page reached
- **if the end of the page is reached**, use a funciton like [this](http://documentcloud.github.io/underscore/#debounce), which would enable the plugin again
- when the scroll is activated, the plugin would activate

The function I linked, `_.debounce()` has an interesting behavior that is applicable in this case. It would be triggered **only** after some time has passed after the scroll event has stopped, lets say some arbitrary three digit number of milliseconds, `300`. 

So, if a user gets to the page that is larger in height than the window height, the plugin would be disabled. While the user scrolls, nothing would happen, **unless** the end of the page is reached. After the end/bottom of the page is reached, **and** the scroll event has been stopped for some period of time, that would re-enable the plugin and in the next scroll event, the expected behavior for the user would be to go to the next slide. In case of continuous scroll from the top to the bottom of the active page, the plugin wouldn't activate and used would have to ""pause"" for a moment.

There would be no additional dependencies as the function doesn't use anything specific to underscore.js (more [here](http://davidwalsh.name/function-debounce)).

There scroll behaviour keeps firing even after 1 second depending on the acceleration of the scrolling. 

I guess the way to go would be to force the user to reach the bottom, and then, after another scroll from the user, scroll the section. But the problem here is how we define the ""2nd scrolling"". As the scrolling event can be firing for 1 second after the user stops scrolling...

Basically I am requiring users of my website to first scroll down to the bottom of a scrollable section, then stop there and wait for 750ms before scrolling again to move on to next section.

941,2015-05-18 09:27:34,"@Canubiz I think that might cause problems in devices with kinetic scrolling such as Apple track-pads. They might have difficulties scrolling down because of the scrolling inertia and they will have to stop scrolling for more than 750 milliseconds. 
",alvarotrigo,
941,2015-05-18 15:24:47,"@alvarotrigo Thanks for your feedback. I developed this modification on a MacBook Air esp. testing its trackpad control and it seems to work exactly the way I'd expect to. I believe it's exactly the way scrolling on a fullpage website, including more content on a single section than it can fit, should behave: not scroll over that content at the bottom of a section, but stop there and require another, separate scroll attempt (detected but a short amount of time without any scroll events recognized) to move on to the next section.
The value of 750ms is for sure something open for debate and fine tuning. I also tried with much lower values like 250ms and it still works very well, maybe even better…? So maybe, with a lower value we can still reach the purpose to stop over-scrolling scrollable section content but still serve visitors well who want to quickly jump to the next section.
Note: this modification does not influence scrolling behavior of sections without scrollable content inside them. So in conclusion, if one does not have scrollable sections, this should change nothing in user experience. On the other hand, if one uses scrollable sections, user experience dramatically improves, at least from my point of view, as users cannot easily over scroll any content they wanted to go to and read.
I will do some more testing with the separate Apple Magic Trackpad and the Magic Mouse as well as trackpads on some other Mac models from friends and family and will come back with results, if you're interested. :)

This is a bit counterintuitive, since most of the users usualy ""flick"" on tablets and expect the page to continue with that inertia, so that part is a bummer...

Indeed, I believe the lack of inertia is because the Slimscroll.js framework being used here doesn't support it at all. So, please correct me if wrong, but I think the lack of inertia when scrolling within a section should also be present in the original examples provided with the fullpage.js project.

There even is an issue thread here discussing if it's possible to use iScroll instead of slimscroll framework to improve the way scrolling looks and feels: #623

",Canubiz,
941,2015-06-04 00:05:20,"@Canubiz yes, my bad, I was talking about 'overflow: auto', in fact your example is exactly what I meant. I believe mobile devices do use the 'momentum' with the CSS mentioned, and I know for sure that Windows Phone 8 uses that (along with iOS and the -webkit- prefix).

Not sure about Android, but I think it goes the same way. So maybe a solution would be to check if there's 'movement' on the scrolling (swipe), say check for X milliseconds if the scrollTop changes. If it doesn't change then we reached the end of that DIV with overflow and now we call the method to advance to the next slide (up or down).

@alvarotrigo I did use iScroll on some projects and it behaves bad on some Windows Phones, so I had to change my mind about presenting cool scrollbars to the user OR presenting them a better scrolling experience. Turns out I had to switch off iScroll on this case and only use it on other devices. As for the scrolling itself, it worked without problems with just the 'overflow:auto' CSS for the Windows phones.

In my opinion, the user, on a mobile device, rarely, and I mean RARELY uses scrollbars to navigate up and down / left and right on web pages and/or apps. The scrollbars don't even show up on some devices, so why should I bother? :)

I started from @Canubiz's idea. This method stops the scrolling for 250ms once you hit the bottom of the div for the 1st time, resets the variable and you can scroll on the next time.

The scrolling inertia should should keep firing scrolling events for more than 250 milliseconds and, if the inertial scrolling is accelerating (this is an improvement since the topic was opened), then you should be stuck in the section until the inertia stops.
",alvarotrigo,
941,2016-10-04 12:32:02,"@reddo by the way, shouldn't you be clearing your timeout? Otherwise what you are getting is just a delayed scrolling, but that will take place even after the smallest scrolling, like it happens now.

@alvarotrigo It really is working good, even using my trackpad (MacBook Pro Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015; with latest OsX and Chrome). 

I don't clear the timeout because I want the page to scroll to the next section if the user keeps scrolling. I'm not saying this is the best solution, but I just wanted to share in case I can help someone else.

Could you advise on usage as i'm not proficient in js - am I supposed to copy the gist and replace the corresponding section in the jquery.fullPage.js file??

@alvarotrigo are you in support of the gist or are you still seeing potential issues?

Thanks,
",db-24,
941,2016-10-26 13:41:59,"@db-24  I haven't tested it myself. So I can not say much. But I do not see any `clearTimeout`, which means the timeout will always get fired no matter what the action of the user is. As it will always enter in the timeout the 1st time it reaches the top or the bottom.

My guess is, kinetic scrolling will keep firing mousewheel events that will kept being caught by the `scrolling` function (unless they are of less intensity the the previous ones average) and therefore this gist will only cause a 500 milliseconds delay, but will keep scrolling up or down when reaching the top or bottom with a single swipe in a Mac trackpad (or similar) 

To test it. I suggest a **fast** but single swipe in the trackpad / magic mouse when you are about to reach the end of the scrollable section.

@alvarotrigo: That is how I intended it. It should keep scrolling after the 500ms; I added that timeout just so I stop accidental scrolling, I still want to be able to scroll to the whole page if I want to, I don't want to have to stop after each section and start scrolling again, but I already explained this. Maybe someone needs it different, but right now it suits my needs perfectly.

I have not found a perfect way to solve this, but in my way, it can set the `delay` attribute to weaken the problem with Mac trackpad and Magic Mouse I guess.

Fixed elements are never just within a section. They will be fixed for all sections. You might be talking about using absolute positioned elements.

939,2015-01-02 17:31:07,"Great plugin.  Very simple to use and easy to customize.  I would like to extend this to add two other functionalities - a simple down arrow to click on and a way to let the user scroll down using the spacebar,

In my intro page, I want to make sure users understand there is more to see than the first slide.  I know some users prefer scrolling with the spacebar (not common, but I know they exist) and in my current demo before I found your plugin, I was using a down arrow icon to show there is more to the page.

For the down arrow:
I know you have the option for a vertical navbar with circles and it shows nice detail since it will lists all pages and I like the tooltips, but I was wondering if it would be useful to simply have a down arrow that is located in the bottom center.

I will use my current code which includes a div in the html on each slide and styling it with css and using the link to the next section.  I could add another function similar to addVerticalNavigation with a name like addArrowDown and append the html to the end of each section and still style the same with the css so that I do not have to manually add the arrow html to each section.

For the spacebar:
I think this can be added by extending the function keydown function and changing these lines (case 32 is for a spacebar):

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

My IE issue turned out to be a tiny syntax error that screwed everything

some exception is thrown which causes the script to navigate slides or
sections with the most subtle of touch. Adjusting thresholds has no effect.
But double clicking with the mouse or interacting with the site on another
way seems to fix it. Its the strangest thing.

thanx for your great work! Your script is really amazing and i reeally love to work with it. There is just one litte fun killer: on iOS-Devices the script is not offering scroll-bars if the content ist to large to show in the section - and now comes the crazy part: the problem only occurs, when i'm working with videos in the sections.
The user has to change its devive from landscape-mode to portrait-mode and back (or from portrait to landscape and back) to get scroll-bars, which isnt't the spirirt of a good usability. 

An example with videos: http://bit.ly/1AAxSUI
an example without videos: http://bit.ly/13J3VIb

The only css-code for videos i'm using is:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

i set the script in the header ""verticalCentered: false"" and ""resize : false"" to avoid the the forefox-bug with resizing and used media queries instead (issue #284).

First i thought this could be the ios scale bug, but no bugfix (like this one: http://bit.ly/1AAxSUI)  is working at all. 
Can you help me solving this problem?

It does when using `scrollOverflow:true`.

It sounds like you are loading some content dynamically in the sections after the plugin has been initialised. 

Try setting the height of the video on the html markup so the plugin can known in advance its size before it loads.

You can also try to initialise the plugin on load instead of on document ready or you can use the function `reBuild` provided by fullPage.js after all the content has loaded or even by using a timeOut.

when fullPage have to create a SlimScrollHandler, the function-call() at the end will only pass the window-object.
Better, or more useful it would pass the variable »container« instead of »this«.

Got this issue though, so if you enter this site - http://mlli.eu/portf/#projects

a) Do I have to edit the ""fullpage"" javascript to make the animations work on scroll down (and can I edit this to make the animation reverse when scrolling up)?
b) Do I need to edit the css of specific object I need to animate like sliding across and fading?
c) Also how do you get images to respond like the text does?

906,2014-12-08 15:20:02,"a) nop.
b) yeah, that's a way to do it. You can use the class added to fullPage.js container to determine in which section/slide are you in. 
Or you can also do it by using javascript and the callbacks fullPage.js provides such as `afterLoad` or `afterSlideLoad`.
c) You can not, you'd better look for CSS3 media queries.

To sum up, I would recommend you to google more about the topic of CSS or javascript animations and/or to ask in other places such as http://stackoverflow.com/.

Your problem is not with fullPage.js but with knowledge about CSS and Javascript. Once you know how to create animations with any of those methods, you can come back if you have any trouble implementing them with fullPage.js.

Have to view it in **debug** view to see the bug.

Here's what the script does. Upon reaching the last section, I disable autoscroll and attach a listener to window's scroll event. This is to enable users to view the footer, and to scroll back up a section when user scrolls above 20px of the last section.

Here's the problem. When I scroll right to the bottom in Chrome with the touch pad on my MBA, scrolling back up to section 3 caused chrome to display a grey screen, and the site just stop responding.

That's another issue. I already knew about it as it has been mentioned some times before. It is due to the fact that the scrolling event is being registered for some milliseconds or even 1 second after the user stops scrolling. It depends on the acceleration of it. It is known as the ""kinetic scrolling effect"".

I'm aware that this probably is nothing that can be fixed but I wanted to make you aware of it anyway. When running Chrome on Android (only tested in Android 5) the browser hides the adress bar when scrolling down which leaves each screen with an incorrect height. You can see part of the next screen at the bottom of the current one.

898,2014-12-05 11:13:38,"Are you talking about when you use `autoScrolling:false`?

It was readjusting itself in previous versions, which was causing [this issue](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/799). It was fixed by avoiding the readjusting.
",alvarotrigo,2014-12-05 12:09:06
898,2014-12-05 12:01:42,"No, I'm asuming this happens because when the page loads the adress bar is visible and then the height of each section is calculated according to that viewport. But when you scroll down the adress bar dissapears leaving each section with an incorrect height.

However when you scroll up the adress bar reappears making the viewport smaller again.

898,2014-12-05 12:09:06,"@ZNS yeah, doesn't sound like there's a proper solution for it. It is something quite difficult to solve as it depends on different devices and different versions of their OS. 
It is like this today, but it might change next year with an OS or browser update as well. Quite difficult to maintain unless mobile browsers come together to discuss about providing a way to deal with the address bar for developers.

I'm still hoping that there might be a solution to hide the address bar in iOS 8 when autoScrolling is on. One of the best solutions I found is this:
https://github.com/gajus/brim

We tried to get it work with fullPage.js , but it didn't work and broke the viewport completely. However, do you see any chances to integrate the solution of brim into fullPage.js? Would be awesome!!

896,2014-12-04 15:27:51,"Not really planning to do anything with it. 
Each browser deals with it in a different way, and each version of the OS, so its crazy trying to deal with it and more to maintain it for a future with changes in the OS or in the browsers.

If you want to hide the bar in landscape the easier way to deal with it in Safari for iOS is by avoiding anchors as you can see [in this example](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/noAnchor.html).

If you use `display:none`, for Slic.js container you won't have the problem. It is using a fixed `width` in pixels.

In any case, remember you should initialize them in the `afterRender` callback of fullpage.js as said in the docs:

> **afterRender**
> This callback is fired just after the structure of the page is generated. This is the callback you want to use to initialize other plugins or fire any code which requires the document to be ready (as this plugin modifies the DOM to create the resulting structure).

Then to get the number of slides.in the active section:

Why do you have a `moveTo` outside fullPage.js? Why do you have another one inside `afterLoad`?

Just use the same code inside `afterLoad` than in `afterRender`. Add your code in a function and that's it.

What I'm trying to say, is that once you enter responsive mode, you don't need the 100% height sections. And if maybe you do, the best workaround would be an option like _responsiveHeight_.

Note that fullPage.js adds the class `fp-responsive` to the `body` when the site becomes responsive. I would make use of that in your CSS instead of media queries. That way both will match. 
The difference of using media queries or the value added in fullpage.js shouldn't be very big in any case, just a few pixels as detailed in the post you provided due to the vertical navigation bar.

which is the best way to disable slide elements (`<div class=""slide"">`) on mobile devices? I want to list these elements one below the other with `autoScrolling:false` option, the height doesn't need to be fitted. It must be ensured that the sliders are still working on desktops.

884,2014-12-03 11:01:20,"I would opt to make two layouts for your site. One for mobile devices and other for desktop users. 
Also, using CSS3 media queries could help for it.

The layout for mobile phones would only have sections and not a single slide.

Fullpage.js doesn't work with sections inside sections, so that'd be the easier way I believe.

Same issue here, and I'm tearing my hair out trying to find a fix, you can see what I mean if you go to   www.antonvolt.com   , the video is the 2nd section down. Full screen works fantastic, also as you move the width side ways, its great. BUT!!! if you resize the browser vertically only, the video starts sticking out on the slide above the video and the slide below the video. (I have 2 rows of bookmarks, so even in standard 1080p or 1440p ratio, this happens.

I used to have a full screen image where the video is now, and cover worked just perfect, no such issues. But the second the video gets in there, it starts screwing up the content on the before and after slides the second browser is a little narrow vertically. Alvaro, you're the man, this is a killer plugin, but I'm close to giving up as videos will be somewhat of a priority in this site so I'm close to giving up and trying something else.

By using the callbacks fullPage.js provides you can achieve many things, but I can not code examples for everybody as that's about jQuery or javascript knowledge and I'm not here as a teacher, but as a way to keep improving the plugin and solve issues directly related with it.

I usually reefer people to stackoverflow.com because its a place in which you will find answers to your questions by people who knows about those languages.

Examining the css shows that the top position for the containing div is incorrectly set to 1995 instead of 995.

You could use `setAllowScrolling(false)` on the `afterRender` callback to prevent the scrolling when loading and set it to `true` after 1 second or so, so the users have time to see the animations of the first section. You can do that with `setTimeout`.

863,2014-11-23 11:27:55,"Hello there,
and thanks for this awesome plugin, I used it in quite a lot projects lately, but I encountered a little problem in my latest one.
#1 Sometimes my page just decides that it doesn't want to scroll at all. I have to hit Refresh a few times and then it automatically switches to the 2nd section without me scrolling.
#2 The second problem I'm facing is the onLeave-Callback, this is exactly what I need because I want to start another animation as soon as the scroll starts, but it doesn't fire when for example navigated via the section-navigation on the right. I would've need to use the afterRender-Callback but this fires to late for what I want to do.

Any workarounds for these 2 problems?

// edit: I kinda fixed this with a dirty html workarround ;)
<s>I have a page which starts with a big herobanner (100% width, 100% height) and after this banner the page starts with fullpage.js which has a non moving part left (50% width 100% height) and a right part which is made with fullpage.js (also 50% width 100% height). Everything works fine so far. But as soon as I want to add this herobanner div above the page somehow fullpage detects it as a page-section even though I don't use the section selector on it.</s>

http://hastebin.com/ineqiqaqis.xml
<s>this is the HTML structure of my page, what happens is that when scrolling down on the herobanner div it loads the first fullpage section as normal but then I can't scroll down anymore only back up.</s>

<s>I'm not that good with english and I don't really know how I should explain my problem. tl;dr: I just want to have a full width div above the rest of the page which is created with fullpage.js, and the autoscrolling should only start after entering the part after my herobanner. </s>

Sounds that you are doing something wrong there. Check your HTML markup and your javascript console. Also, if using ajax, you'd better destroy the plugin and initialise it again.

I don't know what your _section-navigation on the right_ is, but it sounds it loads the site again, as the `afterRender` its called only once after the page and the plugin are loaded.

#1 I checked my HTML markup and couldn't find a error. I noticed that it has todo with the classes ""fp-no-transition"". When reloading the page from a fresh browser or after a while, the class is applied to the fullpage-wrapper and the scrolling is not working (even though I can navigate completely fine with the arrow-keys, just scrolling doesn't work). When I then reload the class isn't there anymore and everything works fine.

If i open the root url (without any #achors) this error occurs. But when I <b>open the URL with #start at the end of the URL</b> it seems to work. Strange.

#2 sorry my bad, I'm using the afterLoad-Callback not the afterRender. It doesn't reload the page. Just ignore my description of those two sections right and left.

Some studies show 10% usage worldwide, which is not something to ignore.

Until support for IE 8 is dropped, I guess we could use just CSS fallback to `height:100%` when `vh` is not supported, as done in many other CSS styles.

Here's the gist. Make it up to the developer and use pixels as default value – but don't disallow vh/vw. Why? Because using 100vh for example would mean less lookup for jQuery in terms of finding out window.height() on init AND on resize. This is no longer needed. 100vh is 100vh. Ultimately this means better performance and cleaner code (nothing needs to be inline styled except the container).

I'd go with better performance over IE8 support any day. Even IE9. That's me. And it should be up to the dev and project, no? As well as custom classes for container (fullpage-wrapper) and sections (fp-section) and vertically centered sections (fp-table). More options for the developer. 

Why would this be bad?

EDIT: or show an example of how we could simply overwrite or extend $.fn.fullpage to use vh/vw and allow to set the variables holding class names and such.

854,2015-09-17 10:46:23,"> I'd go with better performance over IE8 support any day. Even IE9

Sorry but I prefer to keep providing support for them. I haven't researched much about `vh` and `vm` but it seems it is not very consistent as @tezro  said:

> vw/vh and of course vmax is inconsistent depending on the browser and the OS.

Using pixels instead won't create any real performance problem in your site. The difference will be negligible... They are only recalculated on window resize every 350 milliseconds, which is not a bad delay. 
Using other measures can lead to problems with other options such as `scrollOverflow`. 

If you are so worry about performance, you'd better use [the pure javascript fullpage.js version](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/tree/master/pure%20javascript%20%28Alpha%29). It is still under development, as I have no much time for it, but be sure it will be much faster than the jQuery version. (plus it is not using pixels as it doesn't work with `scrollOverflow`).

854,2015-09-17 11:06:25,"I'm asking for options, not for you to change the default from pixels to vh. There's a difference!

If not, then how can I extend/replace functionality without having to fork/modify yours? Basically I'd just want to access the variables you've registered to hold the element classes as well as rewriting scrollPage function etc. Can I redefine them somehow? Like extending/overwriting.

The point being, give the tools for the developer to develop using your plugin. Don't limit the developer, give them options to decide how they'd want to use the functionality you've written?

Personally I'd want to use vh for this project. I'd also want to not have jQuery do so much inline to the DOM but use classes instead. The only thing needed to be inline would be on the container, switching sections using translate3d but with 'vh' instead of 'px', so I'd make a variable for the unit.

Sorry for the deluge of questions :)

Anyhow, I've this plugin included in the html, it seems to interfere with scroll on normal pages, I'm trying to pinpoint the source of problem. fullpage.js is initiated on #fullpage. Normal scroll page doesn't have this selector, but still scroll doesn't seem to work at all (normal scroll I mean).

Any thoughts?

Thanks!
",sandrodz,
840,2014-11-14 12:08:05,"Hi @sandrodz, 

I would say that you shouldn't be initializing fullPage.js unless you want to use it.
Also, if you have any `.section` element the plugin might modify its style and so on...

Fullpage was designed to work as a page layout and nothing outside fullpage.js was expected.

**I would easily solve your problem by checking whether or not there's a `fullpage` element in the current DOM structure:**

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

But I guess you have a point, I will think about that. 
Meanwhile, if you want to solve your problem in another way, you could change this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

For this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And you can also change the `removeMouseWheelHandler` function in the same way.
Then, `removeMouseWheelHandler` and `removeTouchHandler` in a similar way:

Change `document` for `container.get(0).` and `$(document)` for `container`. 

You can also apply it to the `keydown` event if you want. 

But again, a proper design shouldn't be initializating fullPage.js when there's no need for it.

840,2014-11-14 16:21:13,"Hey, thanks!

I agree about not initializing, I've tried that and strangely I still cannot scroll, hm, could css be problem?

The global $.fn.fullpage.setScrollingSpeed(0); is very useful.

It's quite a generic feature, often found in libraries such as carousels and scrollTo plugins. If it's easy to implement then it's a great addition.

My need is specifically just with the slides as I want to go to the a section with animation and navigate to a slide (x) without the animation, in that case it's hard to specifically set a speed.

Now I meet a problem, My English is not good, I will try to describe it as clearly as possible.
As you know, fullPage.js let `<div class=""slide""></div>`into `<div class=""section""></div>` to make a horizontal slider. While I used 'carousel' in Bootstrap in my project, it has the same class 'slide'.
The codes like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Because there's a 'slide' class within 'section', it will add additional Left and right arrows in the section, it's a mistake. According to the doc, I write this:

Pull requests are reviewed and commented before being commited.

Some of your changes don't make sense in fullpage.js.
For example, you removed the jQuery fadeIn from the navigation tooltips and you changed it for a CSS3 transition. But you didn't take into account that this plugin provides compatibility with IE 8 and [transitions are not working there](http://caniuse.com/#search=transition)...
",alvarotrigo,2014-11-12 10:21:16

What I mean with that is that IMHO the focus should always be to get the best performance and also usability (for visitors and developers) for modern browsers and only make a website generally working on older browsers like IE8. When someone uses browsers like that he is self responsible that he doesn't get some nice transitions for the tooltips. I believe the most people notice the (0.2s) transition at all.

The problems that I see behind the current tooltip implementation are:
    - The tooltips are created on the 'mouseenter' and removed on the 'mouseleave' event of the menu item which is in terms of performance not that efficient and makes them impossible to debug with a developer console  
    - The content of the tooltips has to be stored in the data of the corresponding menu item
    - The showing/hiding depends on jQuery

All this points are improved in my pull request and you just close it...
Even if IE8 support is a must-have, it would be possible with some quite simple fallback code.

About IE 8, its fine if there's no transition for them, but right now your code still need something else to hide the tooltips in IE 8 because they are all visible by default.

Also, I wouldn't try to change unnecessary things, such as the change of 0.2 seconds to 0.5. As I still preferring 0.2 seconds. Also the margin of the tooltips to the right, left, top or bottom, which looks ok now and it doesn't seem to provide any kind of improvement.

In order to detect the reach of the bottom or top of your iframe, you would need to have some knowledged of jQuery or javascript. 

If you don't, then you should ask in other places such as stackoverflow.com where they will help you much better with it.

That would be a good way to handle it, and possibly and I will be doing.

It seems more logical to me that `#demo` would go just back in time to the previously active slide in the previous section, and that if you want to go back to the first slide, you use `#demo/0` or `#demo/firstSlide` in case of using slide anchors.

maybe ama5's question is still not completely clear, at least i am trying hard to accomplish what i suppose he tries to do and that is: How can i get the links in the section navigation (ie those within #fp-nav) **_not only to sroll to the right section_** (in vertical direction that is) **_but always also 'slide' to the first slide within this section_**. 

Of course i can get this done easily in any navigation element i create myself by adding '/0' to a href but consider the following: 
I have a section (data-anchor='xyz') with 4 slides in it. The section loads for the first time. I use the slides navigation to go to slide 3. _Now i want to use the section navigation of this very section to return to slide 1._
I _could_ use the link in the slides navigation's first bullet to get there, **but, from where i am, slide 3 of the section, a click on the section navigation does nothing** because we are already at the position scrollPage($('.fp-section').eq(index)); took us to before (the '.top' doesn't change). 

It is crucial for me to get this done somehow. Make the slides return to the first slide on click on the section navigation (ie link to #xyz/0 instead of #xyz). Again, no prob in custom navigations, but i need it here.

If you were in a slider and you leave your site to another one, when you come back you will still being in the same slider **after fullPage.js scrolls to it.**

If you want to disable the scrolling and sliding process of fullPage.js to reach that slide, the answer is no. It's not possible to avoid the sliding effect inside the section. You could avoid the vertical scrolling effect by using `animateAnchor:false` as detailed in the docs:

> **animateAnchor:** (default true) Defines whether the load of the site when given an anchor (#) will scroll with animation to its destination or will directly load on the given **section**.

First of all, again, we love your work :)

To all who use this nice scripts:

In our first draw we did not had the vertical dots. The analyse of the visitors way on our site showed us, that many users are still not ""used"" to scroll down a page. So some contents where 'newer' visited. To try to help our visitors we then added the vertical navigation dots, also with the labels.

A new assessment  brought up, that many of the visitors do not use the vertical navigation dots. This leads to the conclusion that we still have to bring up some improvement. We would like to let the dots at this size. Somebody in our team had the idea to show a ""big"" arrow at first and last position to help the user to ""realize"" the page is going down/up. Of course the arrows should only be displayed when there are more sections. Nice would be to see the label of the active section.

The idea is to show the scroll bar all the time, so the users can have the same concept of navigation as in any other site, and noticing there's more content to see.
This will still acting with `autoScroll` so the user will be able to scroll with the mouse wheel and the site will automatically scroll up or down.

Whenever a user drags the scrolling bar, it will scroll like it does in a normal site, and on mouse up, it will automatically fit the screen to the closest section if it was not already taking all the screen size.

We're using fullPage.js on our home page and we're embedding a full-screen Vimeo embed into one of the slides.

Everything works as a charm in Chrome, but in Firefox and iOS it is impossible to scroll over the Vimeo iframe. fullPage just won't react to it.

I tried covering the video with a transparent div. Again, it works in Chrome, but on iOS the browser would not allow you start the video programmatically, so covering the video with a div makes it unable to start the video.

The suggested solution won't work because the iframe is cross-origin. Here's what Chrome says:

In the meantime, it seems that the culprit is in the setAutoScrolling function (line 117) in jquery.fullPage.js:

$('html, body').scrollTop(element.position().top);

My understanding is the the reason for the this line of code is to restore the user to the top of the active section where they were right before setAutoScrolling(false) was called. This makes sense to me. But for some reason in iOS 8.1, it seems that if you call setAutoScrolling(false) once, then it will continue to be called every so often while you are scrolling, thereby making your screen jump around while you scroll. I haven't figured out why this is happening yet. I've temporarily commented out that line, which resolves my issue for iOS 8.1. I will keep you posted in case I find a solution.

In any case, I see you are doing some funny things in there, such as using the value of 1024:

If the change of it is not too big, then we can assume the browser is hiding the address bar or similar, otherwise, if it is big enough, the device was rotated. 

It doesn't sound like the perfect solution, as this might change in a future for other OS or an update of the browser and it sounds a bit weird only the `height` value is updated, but is something that would solve the problem temporary.

And still you have to detect the viewport height somehow. Does it work without `initial-scale: 1` on orientation change? I presume it's the exact same problem we discussed earlier.

Sometimes when I use fullpage.js on iOS devices there is problem with height adjust (height of section is sometimes caluculated 10 times bigger than it is). My solution for this is to use this function:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

inside afterRender and afterResize event like that

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

and add CSS style

799,2017-03-02 12:45:30,"Sorry to get back so late. I did an isolated version like you said and the issue didn't occur. I narrowed it down and the culprit was using the skrollr plugin when using fullpage. 
Thanks again for responding so quickly and for creating a kick ass plugin!

Just in case anyone runs in to the same problem, on resize() I was using the skrollr.init().destroy() function to remove skrollr below the width of 768 and if it was a mobile. However by doing this it caused the issue in question of jumping to the top of the window on mobile when swiping up.
I lost some functionality when resizing on desktop browsers but that's ok. Below is roughly what I had / changed to get it to work properly.


Issue code
`	$(window).resize(function() {
		// Initialize skrollr if the window width is higher than 768px wide else destroy skrollr
		if ($(window).width() < tabletWidth || isMobile() ) {
			skrollr.init().destroy();
		} else {
			skrollr.init({
			    forceHeight: false
			});
		}
	};
});`

Solved with
`	$(window).resize(function() {
	    if( windowWidth >= tabletWidth ) {
			skrollr.init({
			    forceHeight: false
			});
	    }
	};

I noticed in the code that you're checking with window.height and from what I've been researching, to account for the toolbars, etc. it should be window.innerHeight. So I made that change, but it's still sizing too large. So I'm not sure what I'm missing, but I'm hoping you can take a look. It's driving me nuts.

I tested my own site and http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/navigationV.html on an iPad, an Android tablet and an Android phone with the same results: It is very hard to tap the right navigation dot or to tap one at all. Most of the time I just fail to navigate at all, because I didn't tap the exact right pixel.

I suggest increasing the size of the dots or offering an option for that.
For my project I added these css rules to make the dots usable.
I increased the size of the dots and also, which got me even better results, the size of the list item (li) so the dots are 16x16 big, but surrounded by additional 14 pixels in each direction. Therefore not exactly hitting the dots will still be registered as a tap.
Now it is very comfortable to navigate using the dots.

You could hide the navigation dots or override them using CSS3 queries. That's belong the plugin's scope and it something the designer should deal with.

790,2014-10-21 20:27:47,"Hi there.

The new responsive feature unfortunately only works on window resize.
If the page is loaded and the browser window is below the set width (which probably happens everytime on mobile devices - I only tested it on a Desktop), autoScrolling will not be disabled and the .fp-responsive css class will not be added.
This happens because $(window).resize (line 1141 in https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/2e085dad1b09941592ffa09ae1d1f98eb9e25656/jquery.fullPage.js)  is not called on page load, but only on window resize. Apprently it does in some browsers, but it is not expected to happen.
Tested on Firefox 32.0.3.

Also please think about if it makes sense to show the navigation dots when autoScrolling is disabled.

They are disabled by default and its totally configurable. If you have navigation dots when autoScrolling is set to `false`, then is because **you set it like so**.

790,2014-10-21 20:53:43,"Thanks for your rapid answer.
I do not have time for a pull request, but I guess the fix is as trivial as just calling the resizeHandler somewhere in fullPage initialization.

I probably didn't express myself right.
Imagine the following scenario:
Fullpage is initialized with these options: responsive: 1024, autoScrolling: true, navigation: true.

Now the browser window is resized to a width of 900 pixels, therefore autoScrolling is set to false, and the .fp-responsive class is added to the wrapper. Would it not make sense to also disable navigations dots here?
I'm biased by another plugin I used which handled things that way.
On the other hand, I guess a developer using fullPage.js could also just add a css rule to hide the dots when .fp-responsive is present.

Yeah right. I didn't understand what you meant at first. I think you are right, they doesn't make much sense in that case and it would make it easier for people who don't control CSS very well.

A proper design should use light images and serve them in the proper size (usually done using CSS3 media queries).

If you want to load the images of all the sections then you will have to do it afterRender, there's no more to think about there.

Manually blurring non-subjects (eg background) & aggressive graphics compression helps.  There is a hard-core compressor that I use that will shrink most images 5-70%, & some online versions allow free use. 
Also, [sharding your domain for images &/or using CDNs like jsDelivr](http://tombyrer.github.io/slideshow-improving_load_times_with_cdns/#CDN_vs_Plain_Old-School_Hosting) for script & font assets can help decrease load time.

A mobile phone browser can not be resized and therefore it won't make any sense on it unless you change orientation from vertical to landscape, where resize will be fired as expected.

In any case, I wouldn't recommend to use `resize:true` if you want to have total control over your text size. You should be using CSS3 media queries or some javascript for it.

770,2014-10-14 17:36:03,"thank you for your reply.
Let me try to explain the issue with your example file demoPage.html.
i set resize : false in the document ready function 
![doc_ready](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6227968/4632935/73eaf848-53c2-11e4-9c9f-2a5222fbb7de.PNG)
in addition i added very basic media queries to the in pages styles (these are the only changes i made to your demo file)
![queries](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6227968/4633344/84234748-53c6-11e4-9644-de15cbec0367.PNG)

in a desktop browser there is no page/font scaling as expected and the background color changes based on viewport size.
Below is  screenshot of a large viewport (> 768px)
![view1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6227968/4633600/cadeeb90-53c8-11e4-8e66-738915ad9d75.PNG)

Picture below shows a smaller viewport and the text stays the same size as expected because resize is set to false, color changes according to media query (> 480px)
![view2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6227968/4633407/009e759a-53c7-11e4-8596-f5b358054e58.PNG)
 mobile size view port is shown below: text stays the same size as expected because resize is set to false, color changes according to media query (< 480px)
![view3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6227968/4633439/5b586dec-53c7-11e4-9f10-efadf6635f60.PNG)

if you look at the same page on either a iPhone and Android device, the page is scaled to viewport size which prevents the media queries to kick in.
Below is a screen shot of Android portrait. it should have a white background because the viewport is < 480px
![mobile-portrait](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6227968/4633547/78a7eea8-53c8-11e4-9e75-68cbbe462de6.png)

if you go to landscape, then the background should be yellow (viewport >480px) but i stays red which is the background for viewports  larger than 768px
![mobile_landscape](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6227968/4633552/7cee9110-53c8-11e4-88e8-5f520a8c4505.png)

I hope this illustrates the issue and thanks again for your time.

You never leave the mouse from the `mfp-wrap` element as you remove them.

760,2014-10-08 20:02:35,"Hello, 

My question is whether or not you can have the slides stacked, and when you go to the next slide, the current one fades out on top of the new one as it fades in.

The reason that I ask this is because if there are multiple slides, the scrolling gets a bit 'clunky' as you go from one to two over or more. Sometimes it seems that it's rather clunky when you just go over one as well.

If you would like to preview the 'clunkiness', here is a link to the slides page:

Thank you,

Quinton
",QuintonC,2014-10-08 20:14:05
760,2014-10-08 20:14:05,"Nop, the slides are not stacked. They are one after another as you see them when you slide.

If it gets a bit chunky is because your images are **huge**. You are using images of 3700 x 2100 pixels no matter what the resolution of the user is. 

I would recommend you to use css3 media queries to serve different images depending on the screen or to reduce the size of those images.

You will hardly see any website using images of that size. It is not recommended at all, not only for performance but also for the time needed to load them and their repercussion in SEO.

753,2014-10-06 14:01:59,"I would say that it doesn't make much sense to use scrollReveal.js in combination of fullpage.js.

If you are using `autoScrolling:true` (which is the default one in fullpage.js) then you should be using callbacks such as `afterLoad` or `onleave` to fire the animations you want.

The problem underneath is due to the fact that fullpage.js doesn't really scroll the page. It just changes the `top` property of a container or uses a `translate3d` transformation in case of using `css3:true`.

scrollReveal.js won't be able to recognize when fullpage.js is scrolling unless you use the option `autoScrolling:false`, which will make fullpage.js look [like this](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/normalScroll.html).

> Parallax, **as well as many other plugins which depends on the scrolling of the site**, listens the scrollTop property of javascript. fullPage.js doesn't actually scroll the site but it changes the top or translate3d property of the site. Only when using the fullPage.js option scrollBar:true or autoScrolling:false it will actually scroll the site in a way it is accessible for the scrollTop property.

So, there you have it:
Use [`scrollBar:true`](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/scrollBar.html) or [`autoScrolling:false`](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/normalScroll.html).

I have a few scripts that I need to run after fullpage renders that I've placed in the afterRender callback. This works great when the page is loaded. 

At some point I load additional content via ajax, which requires me to destory and reBuild the instance:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The problem is, when I run the reBuild method, the afterRender callback is no longer called. Since that afterRender contains necessary scripts for the new content, I'd need to call those scripts again. The only callback being called is the resize callback (even though the window wasn't resized). 

I could use the resize callback here, but then my scripts would fire every time the browser is resized which would be unnecessary. 

I've tried re-initializing the scripts after the reBuild call, but they often fire before or simultaneously with the reBuild.  I believe this would also solve issue #742

Even your solution works, the proper way of doing it would be to check if `scrolledSections` has any content in it. 
This way `currentSection` won't try to get an element using a negative index and won't be undefined.

Something like:

728,2014-09-22 22:57:11,"Hey :)

Thanks for the script. I've been having quite a lot of fun playing with it. Replacing the CSS3 transformations with the Velocity.js equivalent appears to work rather well. I considered using the transitionEnd event to release GPU resources after scrolling to a section/slide, but Velocity.js handles this automagically and is also backwards compatible with IE8/9. Given that it outperforms jQuery animations across the board and does not require CSS3 transform3d detection, it seems like a perfect fit for fullPage.js, apart from the fact that adds another dependency. I've offset this by using a non-standard jQuery build without the animation module etc.

Might it be worth looking at using Velocity.js instead of CSS3 or jQuery for animation?

CSS3 animations would remain intact. If the user wants to use velocity they would only have to set the option `velocity:true` and velocity animations would be used instead of jQuery ones.

Using `velocity:true` would require the inclusion of a new vendor. It would be set to `false` by default.

Does it make sense for you?

I won't be using it personally because I have stripped fullPage.js down to include only what I need and have removed JQuery and CSS3 animations altogether. Given that velocity can act as a drop-in replacement for CSS translations and accepts a function to fire upon completion of animation like jQuery, integration was easy. 

I'd only fallback to CSS3 when Velocity cannot be found and both options are enabled. I found velocity's translateX/Y outperforms hardware accelerated CSS on my low end smartphone.

I'd also point out in the docs that the jQuery easing pack can be omitted when using velocity, as velocity bundles the extra easings by default.

I haven't played yet with velocity, but I'll take a look this days. I'm not sure about removing the `css3` option, as that would come with the cost of adding the 34Kb more Velocity.js.

728,2014-10-09 09:17:04,"I've been testing its integration a bit on fullPage.js and on pagePiling.js.
I don't really notice a big improvement on the sliding performance. 

When tested in IE8 (IE 9 with browser mode and document mode set to IE8), I even notice a worse performance when using velocity.js than when using jQuery to animate the sections. (it also depends on the animation easing, using the default one for velocity (setting it to null) the difference its quite noticeable)

On the other hand, I can clearly see an improvement on iPhone 5 when using velocity instead of jQuery, but it seems to me that it still being worse than when using css3 translations.

The thing is, I don't see the point on using velocity on mobile phones or tablets, as they all usually support css3, and as the performance on desktop computers is even worse (for IE) and almost not noticiable in other browses, I'm not sure to what extend does it make sense to integrate it in fullpage.js.

If you want to test it, you can find a customization of fullpage.js [in this link](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/prueba/jquery.fullPage.js).

You will notice I added two more options in fullpage.js: 
- `velocityEasing`: sets the easing for velocity
- `velocity`: (boolean) to define whether to use velocity.js or jQuery instead.

I've tried it [in this demo](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/prueba/examples/backgrounds.html) with 15 sections with a fullscreen background. 

Feel free to play a bit with it or the customized fullpage.js to test it.

pagePiling.js also works with jQuery as a fallback. The compatibility issue doesn't really exist there. And in the contrary, it is much slower than when using css3.

> I tested it on some Android and iOS tablets and mobile phones and the animation is smoother.

It doesn't seem smother than CSS3 to me... css3 is much smother as you can test [in this demo using velocity.js](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/prueba/examples/backgrounds.html). Very easily to notice in old computers or mobile devices.

It seems to me that Velocity is **not always** faster than CSS3. Although I believe it might be in some specific cases, this one doesn't seem to be one of them.

That's after I pointed out that I see not benefit at all in using velocity for fullpage.js or even for pagepiling.js. The performance is slower and therefore it won't be integrated.

If you prefer not to use jQuery, you can start to play with the [pure Javascript Alpha version of fullpage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/tree/master/pure%20javascript%20%28Alpha%29).

728,2015-03-14 14:22:37,"> makes me wonder if the pure Javascript Alpha version is slower in web performance?

The performance of the pure javascript version is even faster than the jQuery one when using the option `css:true`. Not sure about when using `css3:false`, but in any case, you should be using with `css3:true`.
And as you are using CSS3 for the animations, it doesnt matter if you use one or another version, the animations performance is determined by CSS animations... which will be faster than using Velocity.js in any case. (as per the comments above).

And when I say its faster than the jQuery version I say it because using direct javascript for things such as loops, selectors, attributes and so on is faster than using jQuery.

> But I thought this was a javascript plugin. How does the css come in?

Plugins usually need CSS styes as well. Pure Javascript means that its free from the use of external javascript libraries as jQuery.

The reason I usually put it in the header is because I consider fullPage.js is necessary for a proper visualization of the site. Take off fullPage.js and any content loaded in the screen will be looking out of place and giving an ugly view of your site until the plugin is called.
Other plugins might be unnecessary or totally independent from the visualization of the data, and that's why it makes sense in those cases.

You could then use any callback such as `afterLoad` or `afterSlideLoad` to focus it:

Take a look at [this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/22459189/1081396).

You can even use the resize event for it if you prefer and destroy the plugin when needed by using the `destroy` function fullpage.js provides. Or even call the `setAutoScrollling(false)` function.

Problem is, when the plugin is not initialised (e.g., the code is not meeting the condition), it blocks the scrollbar. 

Here is a fiddle that demonstrates the behaviour : http://jsfiddle.net/3jwryt1o/

The problem seems to only happen on desktop (`$.mobile` checks, amongst other things, for small resolution to determine if it's a mobile device ), but I've only tested it on chrome/android.

I probably should add that slimscroll is not loaded in the page.

Add a link to your site so I can test it in my device as well to verify it it works on iOS.

But it seems to me that you are talking about the **text resize**.... in that case, it makes total sense. It wont resize until you resize your window.
It needs a point of reference to start resizing. And that's when the site loads.

Otherwise the plugin can not know how you want to resize the text.

As pointed out in my previous answer and in the related topic I provided, that's not a bug. It is the way it works.

You should be using css3 media queries to avoid this kind of problems and not rely on the resize function of the plugin.
The plugin can not calculate the size of your text and decide how to adjust it. That's part of the designer's work.

671,2014-08-29 16:08:30,"Hello,  

Firstly I'd like to say great job on this plugin.. really sweet!

I contacted you via support and you directed me to your readme which did not explain how an `anchor` is tied to a `section`. I have just a couple questions to fully understand how this works as well as your naming convention.

1) If you look at this code: http://www.screencast.com/t/l2h1n57oPL you will find that there is no 'connection' between the anchor/menu link and the section it points to.

A standard `named anchor' link usually points to an`id` within the content that it jumps to. eg.

`<a href=""#section-one"">link</a>`
points to:
`<section id=""section-one"">...</section>`

Is this all `index` based? Meaning.. what ever you define in the `anchors` option in JS is the order of each section? I'd love to understand this prior to using in production.

2) I'm having trouble understanding naming convention used for each section. In your demos you start with an alpha anchor IDs then switch to alpha numeric `#firstPage`, `#secondPage`, `3rdPage`.

Your point is probably that you can name them whatever but this adds to confusion in #1 above :)

I'd love some further explanation in regards to these items.. perhaps something can come of it that can be added to the readme.

Take care!

That's how sections and anchors are linked. 1st section will have the anchor `firstPage`, 2nd section `secondPage` and so on.

So then, by your response, can you verify that elements with the class of `.section` are simply `index` based... the markup order and their location in the dom is tied to the index position in the `anchors` array... correct?

The slide has content that is revealed with a click and then i rebuild ie:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This then gives me a slide with the scrollbars however any ""scrollto.js"" or basic # navigation within the slide will get the page moved but the scrollbar physically stays played at the top of the browser so when you mouse roll down you actually jump back to the top of the slide and then start scrolling.

I can't think of a way around this but internal slide navigation for long slides would be great.

I basically want to scroll to a div or id inside a single slide once it has the scrollbars visible to aid internal slide browsing on longer pages.

This will then give me a full smooth system of navigation 

The issue I saw when using a package like http://balupton.github.io/jquery-scrollto/ or even the default html way of moving to an id with # links was that your scrollbar stays in it's position even tho the viewport changes... you then try to scroll and it jumps you back up to where your scrollbar thinks it was (ie the top of the page)

668,2014-08-29 15:20:27,"Not sure how `scrollTo` plugin works. But this doesn't look like an issue of fullpage.js.
The way of scrolling by using anchors (#) won't work in a page if there's no scroll bar on the body of the site. To generate the real scroll bar you would need to use the option `autoScrolling:false` or using the method `setAutoScrolling(false)`.

Otherwise the scrollbar generated by `overflowScroll` won't act like a normal one.

Plus if you are using your fullpage.js plugin with anchors (#), fullpage will try to access a section or slide with that name.

Sure. Feel free to create a PR for it.

The problem is that you are using `verticalCentered` but you are not creating the required structure for it in your new content. Fullpage.js uses `fp-tableCell` elements and it is expecting them in every section. But it seems you remove it somehow.
",alvarotrigo,2014-09-03 11:15:09

If I then reduce my content and do another reBuild, the `fp-tableCell` gets removed.
On the next reBuild no fp-tableCell gets created and I get my error.

I will investigate some more...
",janein,2014-09-03 11:15:09

In my custom scrollhandler remove-method I did this:
`element.find(SCROLLABLE_SEL).children().first().unwrap().unwrap();`

This removed one layer of nodes too much (probably necessary for slimscroll) so I changed it to:
`element.find(SCROLLABLE_SEL).children().first().unwrap();`

Now it works fine.

Yeah, exactly. The user has to stop for it to work and fullPage waits 1 second to start the auto scrolling.

I have 2 questions about fitting components within the pages or horiziontal slider inside fullPage.js

1)
I am currently using timeglider and high charts and find the jQuery control have a tendency to extend to edge on both sides of the browser and covers the horizontal slider arrow control. Is there a way to use javascript or css to scale the controls within the bounds of the horiztonal slide page, or detect the maximum width of the current slide?

2)
I notifed when horizontal slide is turned on with navigation. the Navigation control will draw right over the slide arrow control.  I have used the css below to fix the layout.

I would be like if you can incorporate in the next version to detect if right hand side navigation is on, and then move the position of the right slider control, and vice versa if the left hand side navigation is used.

Below is the simple CSS I added.

/\* Override fullPage.js slide next arrow location.
.fp-controlArrow.fp-next{
     right: 100px;

You can do it by removing with javascript or jQuery the `fp-section` class from your 3rd and 4th section elements. This way the plugin won't realize there are more sections to scroll and won't scroll down anymore.

Whenever you want to allow the scrolling again, you can add those classes again.

628,2016-03-24 15:40:14,"@alvarotrigo Thank you! If you are interested why I find this good here is the use case I am trying to get working and I think I am nearly finished.

I have a fixed top div that is the navigation, a navbar. This navbar uses flowType to have the nabar menu links change font size according to viewport width and height. Naturally each of the menu items is a div (with the menu link inside) and these divs change height according to the font size of the menu link. This leads to the entire navbar changing height dynamically.

[Here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35584337/fullpagejs-fixed-header-z-index-hides-sections-content) I have found a similar question but see now that just dynamically adding a padding-top value to the `fp-tableCell` class like outlined does not always work.

Instead I think I will either try to add this dynamically changing padding-top value from the changing navbar's height to each of the sections so that the fixed navbar does not hide part of the section content or I will simply add a buffer/placeholder div with the height of the current navbar height to the top of each section, again to not have section content hidden by the navbar.

This I guess would have to be done with `afterRender` and `afterResize`, while having `scrollOverflow:true`, as, especially on PDAs things get wonky. Testing a few things and might make a fiddle with the solution.

Unfortunately `fixedElements:'#navbar'` removes the navbar from the entire site, so I am not exactly sure how to use or work with that just jet, but I am digging.

Related: slimscrollJS has quite static/slow scrolling on PDAs I discovered, will have to see how to tune slimsscrollJS settings to resemble the scrolling more like on a native device.

Having the `fp-tableCell` rule set to `middle` had to be changed to `top`. For practical reasons I wanted to have the content inside sections to start at the top of the section and not in the middle.
Unfortunately `verticalCentered: false` did not work, also tried that before changing the CSS rule for `fp-tableCell`.

The only issue I have is using slimScroll.js for the scroll hijacking (its very choppy on mobile) on the scrollable sections/slides I've opted to try iscroll for a better mobile experience but I cant seem to get it to work.

I have my scrollable area inside of a slide (which gives it a set height which I need) and Im applying the iscroll directtly to the `div.slide`. iscroll looks like it adds the appropriate CSS to the first child of div.slide which is `div.container` as seen below

`<div id=""line-start"" class=""slide scroll-wrapper active"" style=""width: 50%;"">
        <div class=""container"" style=""transition: 0ms cubic-bezier(0.1, 0.57, 0.1, 1); -webkit-transition: 0ms cubic-bezier(0.1, 0.57, 0.1, 1); transform: translate(0px, 0px) translateZ(0px);"">`

But I cannot click and drag the `div.container` element.

I have my iScroll javascript well after loading fullpage.js:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

 and tried loading it before hand as well) and I dont see any console errors but `div.container` simply will not scroll.

I also set the `normalScrolling` option to ignore that `div.container`

Not really. IE 9 still being used out there. 

In any case, fullpage.js is ready to support other external libraries for the scrollOverflow feature, in fact, there's [a GIST](https://gist.github.com/rmarscher/5f3a62b960f5f903a6af) that includes iScroll.js rather than slimScroll.js, but as I pointed out in [this conversation](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/pull/1543) it doesn't seem to be such a great alternative as it will show the default scroll bar on Windows rather than the mac style one.

I would recommend you to try it by using an scrollable DIV in the last section to simulate the normal scrolling behavior and then, by using your own touch and mousewheel handler events, detect when it reaches the top of the DIV and then slide up.

You would also need to remove the handlers as well at some point.

If you have troubles doing so, I could help you with it for some price. But it should be done with external code to the plugin.

I love that you are adding this feature - but I can't seem to get it to work. Perhaps, this is because it is in beta, but I am wondering if I have failed to apply the correct settings. 

I would like fullpage.js to use normal autoScrolling when transitioning from the first section (Section0), to the second section (Section1) , and from that point on, on all subsequent sections (e.g. Section2, Section3, Section4) for autoScrolling to be disabled: I don't want any jumping behavior after Section1 (the second section) loads. 

In order to accomplish this, you indicated that I set `hybrid:true`in fullpage.js initialisation, that is clear, but I have some other questions. 
1.  What should the autoScrolling setting be set to , do I set it to 'false' or just leave it be, on its default setting 'true'?  
2.  So, is it correct that all sections lacking the class ""fp-normal-scroll"" will not autoscroll if hybrid is set to '`true'`?

603,2014-08-04 10:06:15,"The problem is that fullpage.js doesn't work scrolling the page. It works simulating a scroll of the page by adding the `top` or `translate3d` properties over the wrapper. 

There is a logic reason behind this. When using `overflow:hidden`  in the `html` and `body` elements in order to hide the scroll bar, the scrollTop won't work in all browsers. (try it in IE 8, Opera 12, Safari...)
`overflow:hidden` means the section is not ""scrollable"" anymore, and [`scrollTop` definition](http://api.jquery.com/scrolltop/) says:

> The vertical scroll position is the same as the number of pixels that are hidden **from view above the scrollable area**. Setting the scrollTop positions the vertical scroll of each matched element.

The last full-page section of a web page I'm building contains slides. I want to include footer content (copyright info, etc) below the slides, that the user can scroll normally to, without having to jump into another section. 

I'm using scrollOverflow and the slimScroll plugin within sections, and I'd like the slides to slide normally, independent of any footer content, but I can't seem to find a way to make it work. I've included a diagram that will hopefully explain further what I'm trying to achieve.

   Moved additional css to inline in simplediv.htm. The mask css still part of the fullPage css.
4. I think your example could be stronger if you wrapped something around the partialPage to show it is only partial:
   Reworked the example a bit. I don't want to add too much elements to the demo as it might confuse people who are reading the code.

Some known issues:
a. Doesn't work when you have more than 1 scrolling div on the page. The mouse wheel event is bind at window level. This needs to be reworked to support multiple scrolling div on the same page.
b. Navigation dots are not moved inside of the container. This is by design as the partial div could be too small to host the navigation dots.

597,2014-07-25 06:07:42,"In my website, I have a setup of two sections, both containing two slides.

It is essentially structured in a 2x2 grid as follows:
a b
c d

**a** and **b** are slides in section 1; **c** and **d** are slides in section 2. 
From **b** you can navigate to **c**; from **c** you can navigate to **d**; from **d** you can navigate to **a**. 

So my question/issue is that when going from **d** to **a** (after following the chain I listed above), the page first scrolls to **c**, then slides to **a**. Is there anyway to have it jump directly to **a** without the slide? I tried changing the `active` class for the slides using the `onLeave` callback, but it didn't seem to do anything.

596,2014-07-24 15:26:21,"Hi There, 

I'm using your awesome plugin fullpage.js to build this:

http://boom-online.co.uk/playground/interior/

So, far so good, except I'm encountering what I think is a bug. When navigating to anchors i.e (going from the map to the morocco page) the scroll animation appears to ""overshoot"" into the next div. 

This only happens from the Map section to anything further away than Japan, with the exception of the last section.

I've tried:
- Changing the padding for the top and bottom.
- Turning css3 anims off
- Changing Scrolling speed.
- Looping vertically.

Before I pull my hair out, I thought I'd drop by here and see if I'm missing something stupidly obvious or if it actually is a bug of sorts.

Again, thanks for the great plugin.

Edit: I've observed that on click, the current section appears to ""hop"" upwards by the amount it overshoots - this happens in  an instant before the scroll begins.

Second edit: If you click the anchor link a second time - it rectifies itself.

594,2014-07-24 13:01:33,"Hello,

I think I've found a bug in the behavior of the fullpage.js script concerning the option scrollingSpeed.

According to the documentation, it should simply modify the duration of a scroll transition. It works as intended when using for example scrollingSpeed : 5000 and css3:false. The scroll goes for 5000ms, stops and then I can scroll again immediately.

However if I use the option css3:true and scrollingSpeed :5000, instead of a scroll duration of 5000ms as expected, I get a default 700ms scroll and then I have to wait 5000ms before being able to scroll again. I'm using last version of Chrome so this is not a browser issue I think.

The problem happens when scrolling with the mouse wheel or the arrow keys.

I believe there's a way to do it with a big of imagination, by using 2 sections and in the 2nd one an scrollable div, combined with the option `normalScrollElements` and then using the function `moveTo` or `moveSectionUp` that fullpage provides. Firing it when the scrollable div reaches the top again would reach you back to the 1st section.

You probably have to use `afterLoad` calback in the 2nd section so you can create your own mousewheel event (and touch event if you want to support touch devices) and then disable them using the callback `onLeave` of the 2nd section scrolling to the 1st one.

You can give it a go.Or if you prefer, I can spend some time on it for some price.

583,2014-07-18 09:33:46,"Hi,
Before I start, awesome plugin.

I'm building an app where i need to be able to rebuild the instance of fullpage on viewport resize.

Basically, I don't want to have fullPage on mobile (less than 768px), but I do on desktop sizes (greater than 768px), - i can't change this threshold, as it is part of a wider project setting. 

I understand that I can call the plugin to work just for desktop:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

There is a case where a user may resize the viewport from mobile to desktop.

Is it possible to rebuild/destroy fullPage when it crosses that threshold?

My initialisation code:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Calling the function:

Use `destroy('all')`:

Just tried your solution on your fiddles, in both cases the page doesn't
scroll back to top, but, it still behaves like fullpage isn't active.

I'm sorry for my previous bad explanation (and bad english too), what I
need to achieve is to have as first section of the page a fullpage slider
(and I was able to do it), use fullpage to scroll away all the slider (been
able to do this too), and then have the rest of the content behaving
normally (this is my problem).

Maybe now that I've been clearer you can help me!

I'm observing weird panel behavior with HTML content. I implemented panel in such way that scroll and pan should not work at the same time.

I need to be able to disable/enable that script when pan begins/ends. Some javascript functions needed for that purpose, e.g ""enableSwipe()"" and ""disableSwipe()""

I used the basic Bootstrap template and implemented the FullPage structure but now I have two problems.

When I use CSS3: false the cover style works fine but when I'm trying to scroll only the next section moves up while the active section just stays in the same position and doesn't move. It's covering the active section from below.

I don't see why it behaves like this?!

When you [create a new package](https://github.com/jsdelivr/libgrabber#create-new-package-release)  Since you like to make many small changes (which is cool), I'd recommend about monthly GitHub Releases or after you fix a nasty bug.  You could [release](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/releases) at every PR if you wanted; decide how you wish.

Cool thing about jsDelivr that it supports aliasing, so `//cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.fullpage/2.1/jquery.fullPage.min.js` will auto-update any bugfixes & updates you Release in the v2.1.*

How can you execute that in the demo site? I'm lost.

Not sure to understand the problem you are talking about. Which bar, the browser's bar? Or the one created by slimScroll when using `scrollOverflow`?
How can you see the section resize ? It only happens when you resize the browser's window. Why is the browser bar going to dissapear?

Are you using Mac? Window? Which browser?

When you get to the demo page you should be able to see the address bar (the browser address bar) at first, but as you swipe up, the bar hides (it's a Chrome feature, to take advantage of screen space). If you swipe down, the bar appears again. The section resize happens when this address bar hides/shows.

I'm looking for articles about this behaviour and how to handle it, but will have to do more research tonight.

Thanks so much for your valuable work!

I've run into a strange issue (I've looked at related issues regarding unwanted scrolling, tried a few things but couldn't solve).

I'm sorry I cannot share the website at the moment, but this is what's happening:

1) Page loaded. I upload a file with dropzone.js . Once it is done, there is a timeout function that triggers moveSectionDown() :

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This works well.

2) We arrive at the next section, where I have a dropdown menu. Once I make a selection, the autoscroll kicks in and scrolls down to the next section (I have confirmed it is actually the third section). This is unwanted, and it only happens when I first load the page in chrome. If I reload the page, it does not happen.

Attached are the functions for creation of the dropdown:

On slide pages i don't get a vertical scroll bar until i first resize a viewport, then vertical scroll works fine. Any idea why or how i might be able to fix it? For example 

if the viewport on this page is around 1440x800 you will see what i am talking about

560,2014-07-09 21:42:52,"It seems the reason is that your images are not loaded yet on the DOM when the plugin renders the page.
If you delete the animation the problem would probably get solved.

A workaround could be to create a wrapper for the image and for the texts with a predefined height (the resulting one) so the plugin can detect the final size of the future content.

 I managed to stop the scrolling, however the ultimate solution to my need is to enable it only vertically. I have scrolling content on slides and dont want user to switch slides if they do a normal scroll but if it is somehow doable, I would like to give them the option to scroll/swipe left/right ( mainly touch devices)
Using the  `normalScrollElements` option stops the slideing on every direction, So wondering if I can set an option on slides to do left/right only.

Thanks

What you could try is to delete the class `fp-slide` on the right or on the left of the current one so the plugin believe there are no more slides. 

I haven't tested this yet and I can not do it now. But this works with vertical sections.

Just noticed something: The navigation dots and the menu at top will not be updated in the following case (please do the steps to see the issue):
1- In the Examples folder open normalScroll.html for editing and make the following: 
`autoScrolling: false` , 
`animateAnchor: false`, 
`navigation: true`
2- Then open the html in browser and scroll to:
`/examples/normalScroll.html#3rdPage`
3- Then copy the link from the address, go to new empty page, and paste the link, the browser will open in 3rd page.

The issue:
- See the navigation dots you will notice that the first circle is active instead of the 3rd circle.
- Also see the top menu, you will notice the first menu is active.

549,2014-07-06 14:19:00,"I'm wondering if there is a way to make the section resist a bit before sliding up or down.

When using slimScroll it feels that the trigger to slide the section it too sensitive. So the perfect thing would be kind of delay the slide a bit so the user won't slide the section without actually wanting it.

Any ideas? Cheers!

This is what it looks like now when I put the html you listed in jsfiddle. Video doesn't play though.

When i add the class manually (in developer tools), the section scroll correctly.

Now straight to the point. I've got a fixed <code>footer</code> included in the last page (section). When I will scroll down for the last page, I need the scrolling to stop just before the footer and then a ""normal"" scroll to view the rest of the last page which is the footer itself. The top 1/4 of the last page might disappear in the process so I can see the footer. Can this be done already with the fullPage.js or a tweak is needed? I am a novice to JS.

The only way is using the plugin option `scrollOverflow:true` but that doesn't work the way you want.

The short answer is. No. You can't do what you are looking for. The scrollbar can not be added partially in only some part of the site. I would recommend you to use an absoluted positioned footer inside the last section.

I have three sections, each with the same number of slides in. I am trying to make it so that when I move to a slide in one section, the corresponding slide is scrolled to in the other two sections.

I have read through this post <a href=""https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/200"">#200</a> and followed the steps as advised. So far I have:

<ul>
<li>Made the <code>scrollSlider</code> function public</li>
<li>Changed the name of the calls to the <code>scrollSlider</code> function inside the <code>scrollPageAndSlide</code> function.</li>
<li>Added a public function to change the <code>scrollingSpeed</code> value
</ul>


I have then used the <code>afterSlideLoad</code> event to do the following:

The <code>setScrollingSpeed</code> value is different for each section just to test if is working, which it is perfectly. I can't, however, get the slides to move together. The slides in the section that is currently being viewed act as normal, but slides in the 'hidden' sections stay on their current index and do not follow the slideIndex of the slide being viewed.

I've had a good head scratch, but I'm a bit out of my depth to be honest. If anyone would be kind enough to point me in the right direction I would be very grateful.

This way it will work smother in some devices (it is hardware accelerated ) and in tablets or mobile phones (usually).

In old browsers css3 is not supported so it will fallback to jQuery animations. 

Take also into account that with `css3:true` you **can not** use jQuery easing animations and you will have to work with the CSS3 easing effects in case you want to modify them.

To modify the css3 easing parameters you have to do it on [the `.easings` class](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/jquery.fullPage.css#L83) provided in the `jquery.fullpage.css` file:

I use a normal fullPage structure with currently 4 pages. On the second page I created a list with buttons. Each button toggles a 'blanket' with text on it, like some sort of lightbox:

This blanket is toggled by the following code:

As you can see, I add the .table and .tableCell to the wrapper and the container in the wrapper. This is to center the content on the blanket the same way as the content is centered in the pagesstructure of fullPage.

The issue is: the blanket is toggled, but the content isn't vertically centering. If I then resize the window it will be centered correctly. So in some way, the structure is rebuild when I resize the window and if the blanket is already toggled and visible, the content will center. Can I push this rebuild in the toggle code?

The menu doesn't have to use `position: fixed`, it can use `position: absolute` as well. I think the plugin should be agnostic of how do I style my menu and not change DOM structuring unless there's a really good reason for it. I would simply suggest in the README how to style the navigation.

Well, as commented in the code, the reason is to avoid problems when using `css3:true`.
I guess I will remove the portion of code which moves it from its original place as it was just there to solve problems in v1.
Now with v2. If the menu is placed outside the fullpage wrapper there shouldn't be any problem.

The absolute position of the element wouldn't cause any trouble in the interface either as it would act like a fixed one in this case :)

The way it is now, once you reach the end and try to swipe one more time it will scroll all the way back to the first slide.

For example what I would like it to do is if you have a horizontal scroll with 5 slides, 1, 2, 3 ,4 & 5- when you start at slide 3, scroll all the way to the left to slide 1, it would stop if you tried to slide to the left any further, vise versa if you scroll to the far right it would stop at the last slide (slide 5) and you would have to swipe back through to the middle (slide 3).

First off, I want to say thank you for putting together such a great plugin. I found it so easy to implement and well documented.

Onto my issue... If you go to my site (http://joebaz.com/v2/index.html) you may notice that the height of each section is calculating the entire document height (over 5000px) and writing the inline style. If you resize the window, then the script properly calculates the height of the viewport and updates the inline style. 

Not sure if this is a bug or I am breaking this with my design, but I would love whatever guidance you could spare. Thanks a lot! :-)

First of all; nice job on Fullpage!
I'm implementing it in a responsive Boilerplate template. It seems to work, however I encounter some problems during testing. 

When scrolling (autoscroll = true) from the first slide to the second and to the third; works perfect The fourth and last slide contains the full website content so the fourth slide is bigger than the other slides. I've implemented it in the last slide so there has to be a scrollable area because it's larger than the other three slides. The scrolling in the scrollable area seems very choppy. autoscrolling and scrollOverflow is true. Do you have an idea what's causing this choppy scrolling?  On a mobile device it's really bad..

Also, when scrolling from the third slide to the fourth slide: it looks like the third slide is overlapping the fourth slide at the top while scrolling down to the fourth slide.

Do you have an idea about what could happends at that moment? And can I fix it in some way?

First, my landing page uses the sections to scroll through high level categories such as design/photography/video, and then one level down, I'm using the slider functions to scroll through specific items in each of those portfolio categories.

496,2014-06-08 15:37:11,"Hello again,

I'm having problems placing images with absolute positioning. When I place an image in slide 3 for example, it shows up in every slide instead of just slide 3.

For example:

<div class=""section"" id=""home"">

  <div class=""slide"" id=""home1""> </div>

  <div class=""slide"" id=""home2""> </div> 
  <div class=""slide"" id=""home3"">
    <a href=""#firstPage""><img src=""imgs/example.jpg"" style=""position: fixed; top: 35px; left: 40px;width:260px;height:35px;""></a>
  </div>  
  <div class=""slide"" id=""home4""></div>

  </div>  

It shows up in every slide. How can I make sure it only shows up in the slide I placed it in?
Also, when I place an embed SWF in any slide, it shows up in the first slide. Can't I place them in a specified slide?

The plugin can not know which size you want for the text on the first load.

When using `resize:true` it will resize the text down when reducing the size of the window in reference to the original size.

I would recommend you to use css3 media queries to deal with this problem instead.
And turn `resize:false` if you prefer.

If you'd like to allow looping from the last slide to the first but prevent looping from the first to the last slide,
you can also 
1) set the loopHorizontal option to true,
2) set the default CSS for the left arrow to display none:

Forgive me if this isn't a fullpage.js issue, but I am trying to set up sidebar links that will scroll to the proper anchor tag within a content div.

For instance, when I load a section, I have two columns within this section (Content and a sidebar). The sidebar has quick links that are intended to be clicked on so that the content will scroll to the proper anchor tag.

When I do this, the browser actually forces the anchor tag into the right position, but it does NOT take fullpage.js into account and completely breaks the layout. 

Is this something with the slimscroll plugin itself (I can't find any answers there) or is there a way to implement this within your plugin?

The browser action to access an anchor link is to scroll the page, and fullpage.js doesn't work scrolling the page but adding a negative top property.

Also, you are trying to scroll inside a div, which I'm not quite sure if it is possible with the default browser action for anchor links... you might need to use jQuery for it.

The effect for me is that on initial load the sections are overly long (up to 2x screen size on small screens) and as soon as the browser is resized or the mobile device rotated the sections have thir correct sizes and fit perfectly. No section content would be longer than a single screen size. 
I inspected the sections with chrome, it seems as if the initial reload has additional padding on top of a section but after resizing the window this padding is gone.

475,2014-05-22 22:23:31,"Right now the library does 2 things (which make total sense):
1. When the user clicks on a link with a target as the href, the library recognizes the 'hashchange' event, and changes to the selected page.
2. When the user scrolls on the screen, the library recognizes the scroll event and changes to the next page in the scroll direction.

However, when the user scrolls and the library changes the page, it does not update the window location hash. This means that if someone scrolls to the next page, they won't be able to deep link to that page. They will be able to deep link if they click on a link with a target as the href, but not scrolling.

Here's a user story if this helps:
1. User visits website, first page is shown by default.
2. User clicks on `<a href=""#page2"">Page Two</a>`, which changes the URL to `http://example.com/#page2` and triggers the `window.hashchange` event.
3. FullPage.js' listener on the `window.hashchange` event animates to the next page.
4. User copies url to direct people to page2 and people who click on `http://example.com/#page2` will successfully see the second page.

Not working story:
1. User visits website, first page is shown by default.
2. User scrolls on window with intention of visiting next page.
3. FullPage.js' listener on `window.scroll` animates to the next page.
4. User copies url (which is still `http://example.com`) with the intention of showing people the second page.

I don't know how are you able to reproduce it.  The point 4 is wrong. The URL should be with an anchor link (#).

If you try it by using the [demo page](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/), you will see the URL hash changing every time you make any scroll with the mouse.
And that's not because of the `window.scroll` event, but because of the mousewheel one.

Even if you use `autoScrolling:false` the URL hash keep updating on scroll as you can see in this other [example online](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/normalScroll.html). This time triggered by `window.scroll`.

No. It is firing the [mousewheel one](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/jquery.fullPage.js#L1437)

You should make use of the `normalScrollElements` option then.

This function seems to simply set a parameter, it does not remove events listeners.

I also unwrap some content, but I am not very sure it sufficient: please check by yourself what we really need to do.

Also, the plugin set hardcoded CSS styles to sections which can't be removed easily: we should simply add classes to these elements and define CSS properties in the external CSS file.

By the way, the main objective of my pull request was to remove events handlers, not to totally remove DOM structure generated by  the plugin... But yeah, it would be better if we can do that.

I have header which isn't in any frame. When first frame scroll down, the header automatically disappear. (Which I want too). I have seen your plugin sets the container top with respect to frames. Now when again I scroll back to frame one, the header isn't shown. When I saw in firebug, the plugin has set the container top as `-151px;`Due to this problem the header isn't shown. I want to set the top of container as 0 when first frame is in view. I has tried `onLeave` and `afterLoad`events to check index. But it first set the plugin overrides my set value. 

I just want to ask how can I control this option. Whenever first frame is loaded, the container top becomes 0.

Looking forward for quick response.

I would say this is not possible. (apple magic mouse, trackpads, apple magic trackpad...)

You would only need to search for the default value (600) inside the minified version and change it to the desired value.

I still not very convince of adding this change... your case is a very specific one, but most people trying to change this value are doing websites for any device.

The scrollDelay seems like it should just be set to scrollingSpeed (+1 maybe). That way you won't take new scroll events until it's done scrolling but also can then immediately scroll again if you want. 

As it is today, if I set scrollingSpeed to 300 (so that the transition doesn't feel sluggish) there's this weird 300ms delay before I can swipe again.

Also, as it is today, with the default for scrollingSpeed being 700 and the scrollDelay being 600 (hardcoded), won't there be a 100 milliseconds where weirdness can creep in?

Nop, there's inertia in the scrolling event. Even after you stop scrolling, the scrolling event will still being fired for almost a second depending on how fast you accelerated. 
This is more visible yet with Apple magic mouse. Users using it request a higher `scrollDelay`...

> Also, as it is today, with the default for scrollingSpeed being 700 and the scrollDelay being 600 (hardcoded), won't there be a 100 milliseconds where weirdness can creep in?

It seems like a solution might be to relate all of a series of scroll events together and then disregard any more once the movement has started. 

Looking at the events generated in Chrome on OSX on my Macbook Pro, it looks the srcElement, target, path, etc stay consistent within the same series of WheelEvent events. 

If you combined that information with a timeout in the wheel event handler (that would reset the timeout on each event), you could say something like ""only scroll again if I'm not moving and the scroll target isn't the same as the original"".

Thoughts?

I hope this setting gets switched to ""false"" by default as it seems to be a bit of an awkward way of handling this situation. In my opinion you shouldn't really be attempting to build responsive sites if you don't know how to properly control font sizes with media queries.

Not sure if this was made on purpose or it is a bug.
It happens in Chrome & FF, IE 9 works fine.

http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/scrolling.html

When you scroll down the content with a mouse, you are moved to second section, but if you don't move the mouse and still keep on scrolling down, the content will not move and scrolling down doesnt work. But if you move a mouse just a bit, and then start scrolling again, everything works fine.

Lovely plugin anyways.

Ps. It could also be mouse related. I will check with a different one.

I have a section with four slides. I'd like to start on the second slide. According to the docs, this should be possible:

> If you want to define a different starting point rather than the first section or the first slide of a section, just add the class active to the section and slide you want to load first.

So I took the included simple.html file:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And changed the active to be the second slide:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I expect to see ""Only text"" when changing to this section. But it still starts off with ""Simple Demo"", and scrolling right will actually scroll pass ""Only text"". I can slide left and see ""Only text"".

This seems a little odd. I hope I just did something wrong.

That means, it only affects the current section.

And yeah, it is possible. Just use the `afterLoad` callback to do it only in the sections you want and to STOP it whenever you want.
If you set an interval, it will be fired every X milliseconds, so when you scroll down to another section with slides, it will keep being fired and it will affect the current section again. So you have to stop your interval whenever you want. But this doesnt mean the function is global, it is just that you are calling it for every section.

For this kind of questions I would recommend you to ask in http://stackoverflow.com/. 

To use the auto sliding only in some sections, then instead of using the `afterRender` to set the timeout, use an `afterLoad` callback. That way you will only initialize it for that slider.

428,2014-05-06 00:29:43,"Hi again!

Different issue this time, so new thread. When I expand the browser window, the slides adjust so that the background of the current slide fills the window. Perfect. Looks great. I can expand as far as I want and it always recovers perfectly. 

I'm using ""resize: false"", so my content doesn't resize, just the background for the slide resizes. 

The problem is when I compress. When I compress, the width of each slide readjusts to the size of the window. On an iphone, I imagine this would make the site impossible to view. I would like each slide to have a minimum size, like 960px, so that at a certain point when I compress the window, the slide doesn't adjust as usual.

Thanks!

I think a destroy function would really be helpful in some cases. I am trying to get turn.js working along with your plugin but unfortunately I can only set up one wrapper with your script.

With turn.js there are several 'pages' hidden in the DOM along with an active (currently displayed) page. If I get this right I can only use your plugin once on a page – so I would need to destroy the fullscreen-scroll for the 'old page' and re-apply it to the 'new page' once the 'page' has been 'turned' (i.e. another page already existing in the DOM will become visible while the previous one is hidden).

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

The workaround I'm using now is to initialize fullPage.js only on big enough window size. The problem is that when the window is resized, there is no way to disable fullPage.js after it was initialized.
For the above reason and a few more, I'd appreciate a destroy function. It will help achieve smoother, more complete user experience.
Thank you!

First of all, I would like to thank you for your great codes. The pages I've seen using your codes are absolutely amazing!
I am currently building a website using your codes; however, I am running into some issues.
As a extreme html/coding novice, I am building the site by revising your Apple Example page.
The issue that I ran into was:
When the site scrolls into the 3rd slide, the embedded image will not load its transition (ease in?) effect. However, if I scroll the slide back to 2nd and back to 3rd again, the effect would take place.
I've checked the codes against the original example pages and couldn't find which part of the codes did I mess up.
Would appreciate greatly if you can assist me in locating my error. Thank you!

I'm new to GitHub, so, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask a question.

I'm wondering why it isn't possible to hide the Arrows that are used for navigation in between the slides. I realised I don't need the arrows for navigation, and also, they are overlapping the vertical circle navigation. 

So, basically, the element that I don't want is called ""controlArrow"" but I have no idea how to remove it, and I can't find an answer in the FAQ nor on Google.

I also have a bunch of other small issues, but I hope to be able to figure them out myself. If not, can I ask here or ?

I'm using your plugin, but have run into collisions with some of the generic css class names that are being used. For me, an optional prefix property on the options object that gets applied to each jQuery selector would work best. Example:

$('.'+options.cssPrefix+'section');

I'm willing to do this work and submit a PR but I wanted your thoughts on this?

403,2014-04-22 09:41:28,"It would be more simple to directly hardcode it into the plugin.
The prefix shouldn't be configurable as the CSS styles depend on it.

Which kind of problem are you having exactly? I believe you could solve it by adding the ""container"" class as a prefix for the fullpage css styles, such as:

https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/jquery.fullPage.js#L173

$('.section').each(function(index){ } )

...it's possible that there could be other 'section' classes used by other jQuery plugins or it could be a user-defined css class.

I agree it would be simpler to just hardcode prefixed selectors right into the plugin. I see you already have a few prefixed with .fullPage- and #fullPage-, what are your thoughts on prefixing all selectors like this?
",bcanzanella,2014-07-01 11:03:36
403,2014-04-23 11:24:24,"The user defined class was already treated time ago in [this pull request](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/pull/224).

And also, I would prefer to keep it as simple as possible plus using a more complex selector such as `fullpage-section` adds more text to the minified file making it bigger.

I was thinking now about maybe allowing to define a selector for sections and slides, but then internally add another class such as`fp-section` or `fp-slide` which then could be used internally as selectors.

Something like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This way the CSS style sheet problem would be solved, as we could use a fixed selector for them, and the configurable selector as well.
The default `sectionSelector` could still be `.section`.

Of course, this would be exactly the same as using `fp-section` directly from the start:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This way, people that want clean selectors and won't have any potential for collisions can use 'active', 'section', 'slide', 'slides', 'table', etc. as is, without any modifications. For me, I can change the options config to give me prefixed classes so that fullPage can run in a completely safe sandboxed mode.

403,2014-04-23 13:58:30,"That's not what i meant. 

I was talking about referencing sections as `$('.fp-section')` inside the plugin except in the top of it, where we add the `fp-section` to all of the ones defined with the custom selector. 

Otherwise, if you use any other selector the CSS styles won't be applied to them.

Anyway, there are some selectors I consider they shouldn't be customizabled, such as the ones starting by `fullpage` (.fullPage-nav, .fullPage-nav.right, .fullPage-nav.left, .fullPage-slidesNav, .fullPage-slidesNav.bottom ... etc). There shouldn't be any collision ever. It would be difficult to find other plugin those exact same selectors. It is adding unnecessary code to the plugin which will rarely be useful for anyone. 

The same with the `#superContainer` selector. It shouldn't be configurable as it is to maintain compatibility the older required HTML markup and should no longer be used. 

I consider only the main and ""public"" classes should be configurable. These ones are:
-  `.section` 
- `.slide` 

Things like `slides` or `table`... etc, are only used internally. Changing them internally to `fp-slides` or `fp-table` won't affect the user in any way, it won't add so many bites and the problem would be solved. 
The end user doesn't have to know about these selectors.

403,2014-04-30 17:43:31,"+1 Something like this has to be done. ""section"" is way too generic a classname, and is bound to collide with other styles.  If you can't or don't want to make it customizable, just pick a namespace and move to it (""fullpage-section"", ""fullpage-slide"").

This really is a best practice.

I have built a site using fullPage.js. My only issue is, that I would like the images in the slider section to be viewable as a whole and not just a part of the image.

376,2014-04-14 02:58:26,"Hi, i've got a problem when setting    css3: true
it automatically sets the menu as a fixed element, which prevents it from being shown on  the navbar (I'm using twitter bootstrap3 ), you can see this issue here: http://jsfiddle.net/tdrP6/1/

if you remove the menu option, it doesn't have any issues, apart from the fact that you don't get the active class highlight; If you set the menu as a fixed element, without setting the menu option of fullPage, you get the same results as if you set the fullPage option

Example:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Your `menu` option doesn't have to be the menu itself, it could be its wrapper. 
If you use `menu`, then you don't have to use `fixedElements`, it will move it out from the wrapper as well.

The `menu` option just move that element out of the wrapper and creates the `active` class for the elements with the `data-menuanchor` tag.

Why was it? What was the problem in that case?
By they way, you are talking about sections = vertical, and not slides = horizontal .

The `direction` parameter is always passed even they are not adjacent sections.
You can test it in this [live example](http://jsfiddle.net/97tbk/86/).

Would it be possible to cancel the slide moving to the next slide at all.

For example, I have large form split by slides, and i'd like to validate the fields before allowing them to click the navigation arrows.

I've got the validation working fine, it fires on 'onSlideLeave', would it be possible to send an args.cancel(); or similar to prevent the page moving on?

I need to hide a text in the first slide of each section before sliding to the next slide.
I'm using onSlideLeave callback, hiding the text with CSS3 transform and returning false to stop sliding to next slide.
But I need to re-enable sliding to next slide when the animation has ended.

Also, it is a way to abstract the logic of the plugin from the HTML markup. Using the `.section` class allows you to use any tag you want (`<article>`, `<section>`, `<span>`, `<div>`...)

At the moment I have to change your code to be able to cancel a specific scroll. Because you strip all the touchhandlers before adding your own, this way mine can never be the first handlers and therefore never succesfully do event.stopImmediatePropagation() without your handlers having already started the scroll animation.

The usecase for this by the way is when you have a few pages, starting on the second. Continuousvertical on. And then being able to scroll to the first but not back to the last pages, this is then only possible when going down to the last page and then you come back to the top page.

There's a very simple workaround that I thought might be useful to share: simply add a timeout to perfomMovement within the scrollPage function: 
    `setTimeout(function(){performMovement(v);}, 400);`
That creates a lag though, i.e. if you scroll or press keys rapidly, things get messy. Fixed this by temporary disabling KeyboardScrolling until sections are fully loaded: 
    `FP.setKeyboardScrolling(false); setTimeout(function(){FP.setKeyboardScrolling(true);}, 1400);`
(--still within the scrollPage function)
Same logic for scrolling, replacing 'canScroll=true’  in the afterSectionLoads function by:
            `canScroll = false; setTimeout(function(){canScroll = true;}, 400);`
Gives a behavior similar to this: https://cloudmagic.com/ or this: http://torchbrowser.com/
It means users can’t bolt through sections by scrolling, but I guess that’s why god made nav-dots and anchor links :)

The plugin documentation includes all its options and methods and explanations about how they work. 
The classes that they use are (and should be) irrelevant in terms of functionality for the end user.

If any front-end designer/programmer wants to change any UI element style or behavior, they will have to check the DOM structure to determine which selectors are needed for use for it.

I don't know which kind of documentation were you expecting for the `.controlArrow` elements. A single click to inspect the element in any DOM inspector would have been enough.

You might be talking about the delay between arriving from another section and being able to move to any other section again.
This has been treated multiple times in this forum and it has been explained why that delay was implemented. 

It is done on purpose to avoid problems with laptop trackpads and Apple products such as the magic trackpad or the magic mouse (as well as all Apple laptops).

You could change the `scrollDelay` option but users with a other devices will complain...

Hello, I have an idea how to do this, but it will require dublicate the same func. as 'navigation' so my question is, is there a more easier solution for this? I am not using any anchors, so I'm struggling with navigation.

Squares code:

I would like to know if there is a way to jump directly to a slide without scrolling, just showing the target slide and hide the current one. I saw your comment advising to rename the scrollSlider function to make public . It works great but it does the scrolling thing. While navigating to another section I see parts of the scrolling while the section changes. So I would like to know if I can make the transition to the first slide directly without any effect.

First of all i' d like to thank you for this great plug in. Yesterday found it and I love it already. I have just a couple of questions:

I am using a structure similar to this in my html: 

&lt;header&gt;<br />
&lt;div class='lang'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />
&lt;nav&gt;<br />
&lt;ul class='menu'&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;....&lt;/li&gt;<br />
.......<br />
&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
&lt;/nav&gt;<br />
&lt;/header&gt;<br />
when I enable the css3 option, my menu disappears from the page. I found in your code you take it out from where it is due to some fixed positioning thing and append it to the body at the bottom of the page.

How could I avoid this? It something am I doing wrong?

This plugin works over all the site and create events for things such as the mouswheel, the touch controls,the resizing of the page... etc.

You would need to destroy the plugin every time you ""redirect"" to another page in your site.
That's not build in the plugin, this is a similar topic to [this one](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/313), so you should do something like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And everytime you go back to the initial page, you will need to do exactly the same but adding the initialization of the plugin at the bottom once the DOM is ready (not sure which technology are you using for your AJAX calls but you will need to fire the initialization at some callback)

313,2014-03-25 12:24:24,"I have a responsive site where I would like to break up an existing fullPage.js div with class "".section"" into separate new divs with class "".section"" when visiting from mobile (or on screen resize), so that I can keep the fullPage.js fullscreen section by section scrolling functionality, but make each of the elements in the original div fullscreen and change the order a bit so it's more fitting for a mobile screen.

Here's a simplified example of what I'm trying to achieve:
On desktop:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

On mobile:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

As you can see the existing div has been broken up into separate divs and the order of the content has been changed a bit.

I've read through the issues/requests here on GitHub to look for solutions, and tried using both fullPage.js callbacks, hiding/showing divs, toggling class "".section"" for the divs etc., but none of the solutions have been working.

The main problems with the different solutions seem to be:
1) If I hide/show the content with CSS, fullPage still considers it part of the DOM and this breaks the scrolling.

2) If I toggle the class "".section"", fullPage does not detect the divs on the initial load, thus not counting them as part of the scrolling hierarchy.

3) If I add the content on condition using JS, it's not part of the DOM when fullPage.js is loaded and therefore not detected.

Ideally there would be a way to tell fullPage.js to ""reload""/""reindex"" the divs, or at least a function to unload fullPage.js completely and then load it again when desired. That way one could change the DOM at certain media queries or with JS etc., and then reload fullPage.js to catch the new structure/layout.

Is there any way to achieve what I'm trying to do using the current fullPage.js?

How are you exactly changing the structure from a normal view to the mobile view? Using javascript? How are you doing it?

Yeah right now I'm using JS with <a href=""https://github.com/ten1seven/jRespond"" target=""_blank"">jRespond</a> to either toggle visibility or remove/create the new structure at certain breakpoints.

I tried your suggestion now, and it's somewhat working. Though clearing body and re-adding content is not so flexible with regards to more advanced layouts, loading optimization, initialization of other JS etc. - but I understand why it needs to be done this way because of the superContainer wrapping everything inside body. (I tried only clearing/adding to a desired wrapper div but that would only spawn X number of superContainers with their respective navigation ;) ).

At the desired ""mobile"" breakpoint I'm doing the following to empty the body and add the new content with Ajax:

The only problem I'm facing now is that after this is done, the touch pad scrolling becomes super sensitive, making it almost impossible to hit the desired section. Keyboard and click navigation works fine.

just want to ask if there is a way to change the transition effect for the horizontal scrolling?

Could you sketch the easiest way? Can I change it using only fullpage files (jquery.easings.min.js) or should I use jQuery UI? To be honest, I don't know how should I start (as the easing option of fullpage.js applies only to the vertical scrolling). I can handle with the speed of the transition overwriting css, but I can't change the transition effect.

If you are using `css3:true`, then the easing function won't be applied in any case. As you are choosing to use css3 transitions rather than the jQuery ones.
In that case you will need to modify the `easing` class inside the css file which is currently defined as:

Thanks for being so active with support concerning this great plugin. I've read through a bunch of what you've posted on the subject, but I'm stuck.

I started <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/296"">here</a>. Then you followed you <a target=""_blank"" href=""https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/200"">here</a>.

The information is fragmented and I'm not even able to get moveTo() to work correctly. For some other strange reason, the call to onSlideLeave also enters my if statement when the page loads.

If on section 2 slide 1 and I move right (to section 2 slide 2) I want to redirect to section 1 slide 2, but the whole thing seems to crash. I've included the ""first"" var so it doesn't crash before you get a chance to play with it.

I'm wondering if these links I've followed are the most simple and up-to-date way to achieve at least the illusion of horizontal sections with vertical slides. Once I figure this out, I'd like to help by writing a concise tutorial on the subject to condense the information in the cleanest way possible for others with this issue to follow.

From my understanding I need to: 
A) When in section 1 and moving left/right, shift all sections accordingly quickly in the background.
B) When not in section 1, and moving left/right I need to shift to section 1 and the corresponding slide.

> Should I assume that section 2 slide 2 is the last slide of section 2?

No. There may be a section 2 slide 3, but <b>there won't ever be a section 2 slide 3 without a section 1 slide 3 for it to correspond to.<b> The Site will grow in section one, and then down as needed. 

| Section 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | ... |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Section 2 | 0 | x | 2 | 3 | 4 | ? |
| Section 3 | x | x | x | 3 | 4 | ? |
| Section 4 | x | x | x | ... | ... | ? |

^ Something like that. Where the 1's are one series, the 2's another, and so on. 
<b>""x""</b> means no content for slide. I'll mention how thats a problem in a sec, but I bet you already see it. 
<b>""...""</b> means that the website can be added to and will grow from there. 
<b>""?""</b> means it depends on if any more content is necessary. 

Ex. One might add Section 1 Slide 5, and Section 2 Slide 5, but not need Section 3 Slide 5. At that point, Section 3 Slide 5 and Section 4 Slide 5 would become ""x"".
- So, in Section 1, going left and right means that section 2, 3, and so on must follow.
- \- That way, going down from section 1 to 2 will keep you in the corresponding column.
- In section 1, you can't go up. 
- But in section 1, if there is a corresponding slide in section 2 you can go down to it. And down again if there was another corresponding slide in section 3.

If you are elsewhere, say <b>Section 2 Slide 2</b>. 
- If you go <b>up</b>, you should land on Section 1 Slide 2. 
- If you go <b>right</b>, instead of going to Section 2 Slide 3, you get sent to Section 1 Slide 3. (The top of the column)
- If you go <b>left</b>, instead of going to Section 2 Slide 1, you get sent to Section 1 Slide 1.(The top of that column)
- \- Problem: It is the case that <b>there may be no content for Section 2 Slide 1</b>. Not sure how to handle this for all the other slides to correspond correctly. If we don't include it, then the numbers are thrown off. Maybe somehow flag filler empty Slides to be skipped?
- If you go <b>down</b>, there is no slide content. So, you either you can't go down, or it wraps up to Section 1 Slide 2.
  -- Same problem as before. Even though there is no content, there is content on Section 3 Slide 3, so how do we act like there is no Section 3 Slide 2 , but keep columns corresponding?

That pretty much covers all cases I think. 

> What should happen on scrolling left from the 1st slide of each section?

Either nothing, or it wraps to (in this case) Section 1 Slide 4. Otherwise, Section 1 Slide (rightmost). Nothing nothing is preferable to me though.

I'm having trouble understanding section indexes. <b>Is the first slide (section, slide) (0,0) or (1,1)?</b>
I'm going to assume (1,1) because that is what my testing has shown me.

So, the topmost section (1?) serves as the top of what will be the new columns. This works perfectly. 

When I go down from (1,1) to (2,1) it is perfect functionality. 
What Fabiana's code does is make it so that if I go right from (2,1) we first go up to (1,1) then over to (1,2). Perfect!

The missing piece is that I need Section 2, 3, and so on to also scroll to the corresponding slide in their sections so that when I go down from (1,2) I land in (2,2) instead of what happens now: (2,1).

Currently it is being added as a generic div with a class of slide rather than as a fullpage slide - it makes sense to me why it is behaving like this, but I'm not sure how to fix the issue.

Basic structure is:
The first section has two slides as the user must navigate horizontally, but then the third screen is a section, making them navigate vertically - on desktop.

On mobile, all screens must be horizontally navigable. I am width sniffing in order to get the mobile view, and then using .remove() to get rid of the second section and .append() to add it as a slide to the first section.

Is there a way I can do this while keeping all slides within fullpage?

304,2014-03-19 14:49:19,"I've got a workaround for this in case anyone else comes searching - until I find a better method, I have set the width in Javascript of .slidesContainer to 100% more (in this situation from 200% to 300%) and decreased .slides  based on the number of slides there are (from 50% to 33.333%).

Slide 3 (formerly Section 2) now takes on the basic functionality/appearance of fullpage and acts like a regular slide. Other feature or available options for the plugin (such as dot navigation) may not work with this method - I'm using a very stripped down version and have no need for the customisation so haven't checked that they work.

304,2014-03-20 10:36:31,"I believe the easy way to visually create that structure of the site would be to disable the mouse wheel or touch handlers to navigate vertically until you reach the last slide. This way from the user's point of view it will look like the section is in the last slide while actually it is under any slide.

You could use the method [`setAllowScrolling()`](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#setallowscrolling)  setting it to false when you want to avoid the vertical scrolling and true when you want to allow it. 

In order to do it you probably want to use the [`afterSlideLoad`](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#afterslideload-anchorlink-index-slideanchor-slideindex) callback.

I would encourage you to use the option `resize:false;` to avoid this problem and to deal with CSS3 media queries for the styling o both the text and the images.

If you don't want to do that, then you should do what I mentioned in the previous post. Which is a workaround to make it work as you expect.

http://disziplin-gestaltung.de/Stephanie/index.html
If you try out the links in the main navigation(projects, contact...), the ""different"" sites are loaded with ajax and the first load is ok. But if you load the sites like 3 or 4 times, the number of sections being slided at once increases with every reload. On touch devices this works perfectly but mouse/keyboard not.

If you scroll for more than 600 miliseconds then fullpage will scroll twice. I've been testing it with my Macbook Pro a normal scroll won't take more than usually 350 or 400 miliseconds and therefore I won't consider this as a problem. 

It works properly with mouse wheel. An increase of this timelimit would make it uncomfortable for  users with a mousewheel as it has been talked [here](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/pull/73) and [here](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/18)

289,2014-03-09 02:10:41,"Hi Alvaro, thanks for sharing the amazing plugin. I just have noticed a few slight problems, I have only put the website live in the last few days, so have only noticed thes issues today. 

When the website loads on a laptop/ desktop, the website loads correctly but looks slightly different to what I intended, the font size is a few percent bigger than I had intended it to be, however if I minimize the browser and open it back up again, the website looks like its supposed to. 

On a tablet, when in portrait, the website looks great but when I have it landscape the website doesnt adjust as good, I have a header and footer (fixed) but that seems to cover over the writing. And I tried the website on a Sony Xperia, the website didnt resize at all.

I have used a site called screenfly to check different resolutions in portrait and landscape, it looks great in every resolution in portrait but the problem of it resizing is the same in every landscape (except bigger screen resolutions). 

How could I fix this, should I write some media queries specific to landscape? or is there something I could change in the js file. I dont understand js at all but could keep working at it if I knew where to look.

 have tried looking through the issues from other users on your plugin but cant seem to find an answer for it. thanks again.

About he problems in tablets, there might be some problems when changing from one position to another but if you reload the site again in each position it should be fine (mostly). It works well in iOs devices such as iPad and iPhone and as far as I know, in Android when reloading the site. (some problems using firefox as far as I know tough )

About your fixed header and footer, you should use the options `paddingTop` and `paddingBottom` to avoid the overlaying.

Is there a way to delay the input from the mouse, much like how it works with each section?

Would I have to create a separate menu indexing function, or could I just use `data-anchor=""firstproject""`, but then what would the HTML for the actual link be? I tried using a few different things, such as `data-anchor` and `data-index` on the `li`, but that didn't do anything.

I've updated the staging, the first two images on the grid `#design` use `toSlide` with `data-anchor=""project1""` and `project2` respectively, but neither does anything.

About your second question, quoting the documentation for the ""menu"" option:

You need to add the option ""menu"" in your initialization with your menu element. Then fullpage will add the class `active` where it corresponds according to the `data-anchor` attribute.

What I have discovered, is under the `MouseWheelHandler` function in the plugin, under the `scrolling down` section, once it reaches the bottom (`if(isScrolled('bottom', scrollable)){`) I have changed `moveSectionDown` to
`removeMouseWheelHandler();
activeSection.find('.controlArrow.next:visible').trigger('click');
setTimeout(function() {addMouseWheelHandler();}, 1000);`
thus when it reaches the bottom, it arrests mouse movement, goes to the next section, and then resumes scrolling.

I'm not sure how efficient it really is, though. I might just have jQuerry `append` a ""continue to next slide"" button at the end of every slide...

You have to set `var threshold = 0` at the beginning of `function MouseWheelHandler`, then every time you scroll up (at the top) or down (at the bottom) the below script adds to the threshold. Once the threshold has been met, it will continue the normal function of the script. Just have to work this into touch-screens.

So the scroll will only update `threshold` every 50ms. The only issue is that (from my tests with a Wacom, not a trackpad) when it reaches the bottom, it doesn't continue polling. You have to scroll once, twice, then it'll trigger `moveSectionUp`.

Great work on the plugin. I love that you have made it compatible with older browsers. 

I first saw this kind of scroll effect being used on www.hugeinc.com . I've noticed that their effect is a lot more ""responsive"" on touch devices. What I mean by responsive is, you can initiate a scroll partially with a touch event, like swiping down only so far, then if you move back the next page doesn't automatically jump to the next slide. Is there anyway of replicating this effect using this plugin?

265,2014-03-17 10:57:08,"To achieve what you are looking for, i would use the option `paddingTop` to avoid using the same space as your header bar and then I will add another padding for the `.section` elements to avoid overlaying the left bar. 

Of course, the left bar and the top one would have `position:fixed` and they will both be added to the `fixedElements` option (to move them out from the `supercontainer`)

I am willing to sponsor some customization job to the plugin in order to give us an option to specify the inner div where ""#superContainer"" will be appended. Maybe other people needs this aswell when running your plugin in a non-fullpage mode.

If you can't do it, i will assign this to a freelance developer but can you help me out with some advice on what should be change inside the code so i can forward this info to him ?

Thanks again ! I really love this plugin.

265,2014-03-18 10:33:37,"@internetix it doesn't matter where the elements are in the DOM if you assign them the `position:fixed` property. It might only interfere if you are using some javascript which depends a lot on the position of the elements in the DOM structure.
Your left and top bars should be fixed that way the changed I proposed won't _mess up the original html structure._

As I said, the customization you are talking about is not that simple and less if you want to make it compatible with phone devices. 
Also, what would happen on scroll outside the wrapper? Should the plugin scroll or not? It changes many things...

You could accomplish something similar by using jQuery to modify the resulting markup, such as:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

[Live demo](http://jsfiddle.net/97tbk/7/)

But as I said, you should be able to do it with what I posted in previous posts. 
",alvarotrigo,2014-02-26 11:53:09
265,2014-03-18 12:54:20,"The core of the problem is that ""superContainer"" is wrapping the whole page. From the original purpose of the plugin this is perfect fine but if you want to include the plugin in some inner divs it's not gonna work unless we can make somehow that ""superContainer"" wrap only the specific div we want and not the whole page.

Your provided jquery script actually resize the entire ""superContainer"" and because ""superContainer"" is wrapping the entire page in the default behavior, it resizes our entire site :)

Let me rephrase what i meant previously regarding function ""fixedElements"":

This function takes the specified elements OUT of their original location and will append them inside the ""body"" (at the ""root"" body level).

So, after using ""fixedElements"" function on our fixed div, that specific div is pulled out of the original location inside the html structure and is appended at ""root"" body level of the page.
Of course, that specific div being in another location and being taken out of it's original containers will create a problem with css classes thus messing some things up.

Making that ""superContainer"" div wrapping only the elements we want will solve everything and will mantain the original html structure, ""activating"" the plugin in the inner div we want.

I think our best bet is to hire somebody to modify your plugin. Or we can sponsor you to do it for us and include these changes in an official update.

Maybe implement an option that will allow users to specify the div where the plugin will work.
If they specify the body, the plugin will work in full screen mod, if they specify any other div the plugin will work in their desired location.
",internetix,2014-02-26 11:53:09
265,2014-03-18 13:15:24,"I still don't understand why moving the elements to the root of the body _will create a problem with css classes thus messing some things up_.
The styles for the left bar should work exactly the same unless you are relating them somehow with the parent elements (which you probably shouldn't )

You can find example of other sites using fullpage with a left bar like yours in the documentation section of ""who is using this plugin"":
- http://collection.madeofsundays.com/
- http://jacoberiksson.se/
- http://bnacademy.com.au/
- http://www.matrimonia.rs/ (top bar)

I believe your solution to the problem sounds much more complicated than using the proper styling for your left and top bar. Nevertheless if you still want to do it, go for it.

`autoscrolling` defines the way you scroll (normally or by sections)
[Example of autoScrolling:false](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/normalScroll.html)

You would need to use `scrollOverflow` as pointed out in the documentation:

> scrollOverflow: (default false) defines whether or not to create a scroll for the section in case its content is bigger than the height of it. In case of setting it to true, it requieres the vendor plugin jquery.slimscroll.min and it should be loaded before the fullPaje.js plugin.

When the page is loaded, it doesn't bring me to the first section of the site but to another ( as you can see )...and when I paste the url directly with an anchor, it brings me to the previous section instead of the one I want...
I wrote to the author of queryloader2 and he told me that his plug-in is ok in my website and the problem is in fullPage plug-in.
How can I fix these?

My advice? Isolate the problem. Remove all external js except fullpage.js and try to make it work.

Then try to add other scripts such as queryloader2 until you find the script causing the scroll.

It doesn't seem to be an issue related with fullpage.js.

I'm trying to make fullpage work with wow.js (plugin that allows the launching of an animation only when the element is in view).

But, so far, I failed (also, my javascript knowledge is close to none).

One thing interesting is that, when i'm on the right section, if i resize, even a tiny little bit, my browser's window, then, the animation fires.

So i figure something can be done with the callback function, like actualising the window position or something,
but, as i said, i have no clue of the js functions that i could use.

Any idea would be great! :)

Make some tests in your devices if you want to help me with it.

The problem seems to be in the [`reBuild` function](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/jquery.fullPage.js#L1041), it seems the `height` and `width` of the screen is not restrieved correctly.

Just add something like this after `windowsHeight = $(window).height();`

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Like so:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

That will show you on the top left corner of your site the `height` and `width` values for your screen. Take a look at them and see if they make sense for you when rotating the device.

There have been [some reports](http://davidwalsh.name/orientation-change#comment-31322) that the `orientationchange` event fires prematurely, which is why the values are reversed. @alvarotrigo any reason we can't just exclusively use the `resize` event?

(he deleted his comment I think but I got the email):

so maybe we should leave the 500ms delay in there?

Ultimately I think this is going to be _extremely_ difficult to get right
on every device given that tablets have variable CPU/RAM speeds and tablet
browsers (especially chrome) are attempting to behave more and more like
desktop browsers instead of a ""mobile"" browser (since newer devices are
just as powerful as some desktops).

Like Johnathon said, I think 500ms is a good compromise. Developers can
also find this ticket and adjust the waiting period if their application
has specific device requirements.

Everyone -- I just found a couple of great stack overflow answers that discuss this situation in great detail complete with testing:
- http://stackoverflow.com/a/6603537/837042
- http://stackoverflow.com/a/13805104/837042

Going off of the second answer, we should try only listening to the `resize` event and using `window.innerHeight` and `window.innerWidth`.

However, I'm not encouraged that there is a great way to have something that handles every single browser, considering this is in the jQuery documentation for the `.resize()` function:

> Depending on implementation, resize events can be sent continuously as the resizing is in progress (the typical behavior in Internet Explorer and WebKit-based browsers such as Safari and Chrome), or only once at the end of the resize operation (the typical behavior in some other browsers such as Opera).

If in the future is fixed I will try to update it.

Thanks for all and regards.

241,2014-02-13 14:34:13,"Hi,

I tried a lot, but I can't find the right solution, so hopefully you can help me out. 
I'm having 10 sections and a menu (appearing on every section). The menu seems to work just fine, but some anchors stop working when you use it in a certain way.

To reproduce the problem:

• Go to http://opportunitygroup.eu
• Click on What's New > Opportunity Group > What's new

As you see, the URL changes, but it won't slide to the section. Other links appear to work fine. 

The first link(s) seems to be a problem. Also; if I add a menu item with '#home', the same problem occurs. (You can try by resizing the screen, a bootstrap menu appears which contains all the items)

I saw issue #201 and used the latest version, but it doesn't seem to solve the problem. Any ideas?

Cheers,
Dennis

You need to go bit by bit getting rid of stuff until you have the simplest thing to work with fullpage. Once you have fullpage working properly, add again the last bit of code you removed until you reach the  portion of code which causes the malfunction.

In this case it is located at `<section class=""group section"">` and its a HTML markup problem. You added an additional `</div>` which crash the site.

You are using a `name` tag with the same value as the anchor-link `products`.

Just delete it or rename it to other name such as:

This is caused because IE scrolls automatically the site to the element which has a `name` or `id` equal to the given anchor.

225,2014-05-02 22:15:13,"I have a similar question. (I don't know if there is a solution for it existing already, hence I don't open a separate issue for it.)

With full screen backgrounds the images are aligned on the left upper corner, therefore they are cropped either at the right end or at the bottom (depending on what is needed to make the image fill the whole screen). I refer to the left upper corner as ""in the focus"".

Is it possible to define which corner, or that the center, should be in the focus? I've seen there is an option `verticalCentered` (which doesn't seem to make a difference when I use it). The point is, in many cases the photo I display as a background has a specific area of interest: I don't want to show Marilyn Monroe's right ear, I want to show her smiling face, for example. -- In other words, I would love to be able to tell `fullPage()` which area to show always.

Would it make sense to add two options as follows?
- `alignVertical: top|middle|bottom` (default: `top`)
- `alignHorizontal: left|center|right` (default: `left`)

P.S.: The problem is well described on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17722239/full-screen-background-with-cover-but-focus-on-a-part-of-the-image) with the [yellow sign not showing](http://demo.tutorialzine.com/2012/06/quick-tip-fullscreen-backgrounds/) when you make the window narrow enough.
P.P.S.: I've noticed that this behavior can be controlled using plain CSS with, e.g., `background-position: 50% 50%` (putting the focus on the image center in this specific case).

I'm actually using `sections` instead of `div's`, I just keep the `section` class on them. It works just fine and personally, I wouldn't worry about redoing your code yet.

223,2014-02-07 19:32:48,"Hi,

my menu links load a page in a div with $(""#div"").load().
Every time a page is loaded, I call $.fn.fullpage() to initialize fullPage.
Problem : The first time I load a page that has a fullPage setup it works fine.
The second time however, the scrolling behavior gets weird : if I wheel the mouse 5 steps a certain direction, the fullPage slides 5 pages the same direction. It seems like the ""mousewheel compensation effect"" (that allows a certain ""pause"" on a page) does not work anymore.
If I keep switching between pages, the behaviors get weirder and weirder every time.

To repoduce the problem :
1; Go to http://empain.eu?test
2. Click on ""Geoffroy""
3. Go to ""About"". The page works fine.
4. Go to ""Education->Classes"", you'll notice the mousewheel problem
5. Keep switching between those two pages, and you'll see weird behaviors happening.

Any idea of what could be wrong ? I'm sure it has something to do with the fact that I call $.fn.fullpage() every time I load a new page, but I don't see anything else.

Hope you can help :)

Regards,
Geoffroy.

EDIT :
I noticed the following :
1. The slide offset happens when leaving one page to go to the other : if I am on page ""About"" and go to the second slide, then load page ""Education->Classes"", the active slide is the second one (which was the active slide when I exitted on page ""About"").
2. Concerning the scroll sensitivity problem, it seems to be coming from an event propagation issue.

EDIT 2 :
Got a hint here : https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/78
1. I fixed the slide offset issue by doing calling $.fn.fullpage.setAutoScrolling(false) (surrounded with try catch to handle the exception thrown before the first initialization) before calling $fn.fullpage().
2. The scroll sensitivity got fixed automatically.

EDIT 3 :
Once the nav option is set to true, every time I load a page, it will stay set to true even if I force it to false.

222,2014-02-09 14:13:04,"Hi, thank you for your great plugin, actually my issue is similar to the one mentioned here. i tried the solution but din't work, I've noticed that you cannot go to a specified anchor or section without passing through the first section then scrolling, let's say i need to go to section 3 from an external page, let's say the anchor is #anchor3 for example and the page html name is myPage.html, so it's supposed when i write /myPage.html#anchor3 to go directly to section 3 but in fact the only possible way is to pass through the first section every time.
I wish you you can make such option because i think it's important, i know that the purpose of the plugin is the scrolling behavior but there should be an option to go directly to a specified section. (especially when number of sections increases).

There is an alternative way is to create a named anchor manually for each section, but this also didn't work, it will go directly to the specified section but the active section is not specified, also when leaving the page again the first section is shown.

I thank you again for your great effort in this plugin, and my suggestion is only to spot the light on this feature.

Thank you

I tried a solution to use the ID of the section itself for example section 3, the ID is 'section3' so i put in the link /myPage.html#section3  and this makes it go directly to show the section 3 without any sliding, but it needs to change the active slide accordingly because it is still taking the first section as active slide and i think it needs to change some other things like leavingSection, etc..

221,2014-02-07 05:05:43,"Added the ability to have the scrolling appear to be continuous - when you are at the last section and scroll down, the animation will continue downward but you will end up on the first section. It is similar when you are on the first section - scrolling up will cause the animation to continue upward but you will end up on the last section. Navigation is updated and hashes are maintained. This feature is very similar to the loopTop and loopBottom features but is targeted to make the end of a scroll (when there are many sections) not as jarring. 

Clicking on a navigation dot, or navigating to an anchor directly, will use the normal animation: scroll up if the section is a prior one, scroll down if the animation is a later one. 

And, just to be clear, this does not add horizontal scrolling (i.e. this is not a solution for issue 124).

jQuery library code (offset.js module, line 111):

I am not so deep into fullPage.js code, but is it possible that `scrollPage` function first argument, `element`, could be an empty jQuery collection? If so, then this exception will be thrown. And even if you are not able to reproduce this error, does it mean we should ignore it?

Initially it was like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Note the difference between `dest != null` and `dest !== null`. The double equal was introduced by some pull request but I didn't noticed it was wrong. 
The first version was checking for `undefined` by using just `!=`

Would you say it is better not to show any error rather and crashing in silence ? 
I believe I should better remove the `null` comparison and let it throw the error in case of anything goes wrong the user can realize about it. (and it won't increase the size of the file by adding exceptions)

219,2014-02-06 18:19:51,"But I am not so involved into the code, and I don't know yet, may be there are cases where we need this code. But as I can see now, I don't see the scenario when we need that null value. In that function `scrollPage` the dtop variable is used in this lines

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

In first case `-dtop` is equal to zero, but in the second it will be null and may raise an error. I did not trace `scrollOptions['scrollTop']` forward.
But in the third case it will lead to a string `'translate3d(0px, -nullpx, 0px)'` and that is definitely a very bad thing on my opinion.
So now I do not understand why we need to assign `null` to `dtop` when `dest` is `null`. I could understand if we assign zero or another integer, it makes sense. But in case of this null, I do not know when and why it is really used.

Something like:

I don't know where your `sonido` class is placed, but if you have one sound per slide I guess it is in each slide. Then you would need to get the element for each slide, not for all the page.

At the documentation is explained how to use the callback parameters.
Also i guess you want to stop the sound of one slide when you get to another...

Fullpage.js doesn't establish any limit, but of course, some devices or old computers might experiment problems dealing with big images and more yet if they have to be moved.

Try to play with both configs for the `css3` options (true and false) and choose the faster one.

Sure it's a Chrome bug. And it's been there for quite some time without indication it'll get fixed any time soon. Meanwhile it's one of the most used browsers. I'd still prefer to have the control; I'd pick translate over jquery.animate() any day. Also that'd enable me to trigger GPU acceleration for specific sections as I see fit, either by calling translateZ(0) or translate3d() both of which should work.

Using jQuery as the fallback if ""all else fails"" is a good enough fallback and it should remain as such.

What i did:
A div before all divs: <div class=""divclass"">$nbsp;</div>
Css: 
.divclass { height: 100%;width: 100%;position: fixed;top: 0;left: 0;background-size: cover;z-index: -10;visibility: hidden;background-image: url(images/bgimage.jpg);   }
.divclass.view {visibility: visible;}

Then in the fullpage script (where the value of nextindex is the section offcourse, here 3):
onLeave: function(index, nextIndex, direction) {
var $divclass = $('.divclass');  
  if (nextIndex == 3 && direction === 'up') { $divclass.addClass('view' ); } 
  else if (nextIndex == 3 && direction === 'down') { $divclass.addClass('view' ); } 
},
afterLoad: function(anchorLink, index) {
var $media = $('.bg-media');
  if (index != 3) { $media.removeClass('view'); }

203,2014-01-30 16:14:14,"Thanks for that link, I already checked it,  but they are using Tween.js, and I don't know anything about it. 
The thing that bugs me is that when using fullpage.js, the window on scroll event doesn't detect any scroll when moving from section to section.

For example, I use this code to hide navigation arrows when the user is scrolling, it makes a nice effect. It works flawlessly, but when used with fullpage.js, the arrows are visible, which means that scroll event is not fired.

Good news for you!
It can be done and it **has be done with fullpage.js** already. :)
[Here's a temporal site](http://patuque.com/santateresa/prueba-scroll/) of another user doing so.

The main idea is that once you move to the next slide, you will have to move all the slides of all your site to the same direction. This should be done ""in the background"" without the user realise about it.

First you would need to modify a bit the plugin and create a function to move the sliders in the background as detailed here:
https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/129

Then you could add another public function to speed up the animation setting the scrollingSpeed to 0 and then to 700 again.
https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/92

Then you could do something like this in a callback:

No sorry. Won't provide such example as that's a very specific task for the extension. 
You do not need to code it to see that it is in fact possible. Just suppose the slides moves accordingly and figure out what calls to `setAllowScrolling` and `setKeyboardScrolling` you'll need to do.

I can tell you it works. I've coded such behavior with the extension previously. But of course, you need some JavaScript knowledge from your side to use the callbacks and call the appropriate methods. If you want me to code it for you [contact me](http://alvarotrigo.com/#contact-page) and I'l provide you with a quote for it.

Works on **IE10** and not on **IE11** there is no `MSPointerMove` on **IE11**

**Note  As of Internet Explorer 11, the Microsoft vendor prefixed version of this event (`MSPointerMove`) is no longer supported and may be removed in a future release. Instead, use the non-prefixed lowercase name, `pointermove`, which is better for standards compliance and future compatibility.**

I tested with `document.addEventListener(""MSPointerDown"", function(event){alert('e');}, false);` and it works. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8996015/jquery-on-vs-javascript-addeventlistener

Weren't you saying that `MSPointerDown` [is no longer working on IE 11](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh771911)?

Why would it work then thiswhich is using the non supported  `MSPointerDown`?

I have a quick question concerning the css animations (this is what i'm using = http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/).

Is it possible to execute the animation when i go to slide 3 separately from the other slides?

As you'll see in the code below, i have my logo that i applied the animation to. but if i repeat the operation on another element, for example ""logo2"" on the second slide, it will execute the animation while i'm at the first slide. By the time i come to slide 2 the animation is done.

So the question is, is it possible to execute that second animation only when i'll come to the slide2?

What you want is to only have certain animations running when said content is in view. Right now all your animations will fire at once, so you'll have to write a function that determines when animations should fire (you can use the event-hooks to determine when to fire which animation cycle `onLeave` / `afterSlideLoad` / `onSlideLeave`).

I should have explain my problem first. I've used addClass and removeClass to run the animations when the content is viewed. The problem is that just before the content load and before my animations are trigered, the element that I want to animate shows (just for an instant) without any animation. For instance, using a fadeIn animation on a text, I expect it to apear in a progressive way. What I get is the text, whitout animation, and then disapears to fadeIn. 
I addclass in afterSlideLoad and removeClass onSlideLive (to replay the animation when i come back). I don't know if the problem is in the callback i'm using or not...

He hecho lo que me comentas. Definí css3:false, coloqué la función scrollSlider como pública, definí la función setScrollingSpeed y en el evento onSlideLeave definí lo siguiente:

<pre>
var section2 = $('#section1');
var section3 = $('#section2');
$.fn.fullpage.setScrollingSpeed(0);
$.fn.fullpage.scrollSlider(section2, 1);
$.fn.fullpage.scrollSlider(section3, 1);
$.fn.fullpage.setScrollingSpeed(1000);
</pre>


Lo que estoy tratando de hacer aquí es que cuando me desplazo de la primera lámina del slider de la primera sección a la segunda lámina, que se quede en esa lámina / sección (en la sección 1, lámina 2) y que mueva (sin que el usuario lo note) el slider de la sección 2 a la lámina 2 y el slider de la sección 3 a la lámina 2. Esto lo hace pero me desplaza a la lámina 2 de la sección 3 :s

Es decir, en vez de dejarme en la sección 1 en la lámina 2, me desplaza a la sección 3 a la lámina 2. ¿Debería llamar al final a la función scrollSlider para que mueva nuevamente a la sección 1 lámina 2?

OnLeave from a section, I'm adding classes to trigger a CSS animation on specific page elements. This means that the elements move at the same time as the section transitions. Is there anyway to delay the slide transition, until the CSS animations has finished. 

I guess I'm just trying to put a delay on the Section actually transitioning. (Not trying to change the duration of the animation, just trying to setTimeOut on it or something like that).

Thanks again,
Richie

It is not simple to give you a hint without spending a bit of time looking at the code, but you would need to create the data-anchor in case you use anchors for sliders, you would also need to check whether or not to create the scroll bar in case of using `scrollOverflow`,check whether or not the content should be centered if used `verticalCentered` and deal with the navigation dots and tooltips if using `slidesNavigation`.

You probably want to call `doneResizing` to do some of that stuff, which basically re-render again the site adapting it to the current window's size.  But this won't solve some of the problems such as the `verticalScrolling`, `slidesNavigation`, navigation tooltips, data-anchor for slides...

My attribute is written like this, because I wanted the anchors to be dynamic as well. SO the first part before the pipe is the anchor (for the URL hash), and after it's my tooltip text.

Then, right before implementing the plugin, in JavaScript, I used a loop on each section to retrieve the informations I want.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

You can name the attribute as you wish. You can skip the anchor part and use the attribute only for the tooltip, make just some arrangements.

176,2015-06-04 06:59:02,"OK so, to solve this issue
Open jquery.fullPage.js and do this:

1) - underneath //slide find ""var TABLE =                 'fp-table';"" 
    - on the next line paste: var SECTION_SLIDE_TOOLTIP = 'fp-slide-tooltip';

2) - find: ""scrollBar: false,"" (probably on line 104 or 105)
    - on the next line paste: ""slideTooltips: [],""

3) - find ""function addSlidesNavigation(section, numSlides){""
    - replace the complete for loop for:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Then open the jquery.fullPage.css and at the bottom paste this:
.fp-slidesNav ul li .fp-slide-tooltip {
    position: absolute;
    color: #fff;
    font-size: 14px;
    font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;
    white-space: nowrap;
    max-width: 220px;
    overflow: hidden;
    display: block;
    opacity: 0;
    width: 0;
}
.fp-slidesNav ul li:hover .fp-slide-tooltip,
.fp-slidesNav.fp-show-active a.active + .fp-slide-tooltip {
    -webkit-transition: opacity 0.2s ease-in;
    transition: opacity 0.2s ease-in;
    width: auto;
    opacity: 1;

    bottom: 20px;
}
.fp-slidesNav ul li .fp-slide-tooltip.top {

First of all; thank you for this great plugin! Everything is working very nice so far.

I am currently trying to animate an element when you are scrolling to a section. I tried to use the 'onLeave' callback, which works fine when I use the following code:

<code>function(index, direction){
   if (index == 1 && direction == 'down'){
      $('#element').addClass('animation');
   } else if (index == 2 && direction == 'up'){
      $('#element').removeClass('animation');
   };
}</code>

The only thing is, when I am for example on section 9, and click in the menu to go to section 1, it does not recognise the movement. It would be great to have a callback which does recognise this. 

Thank you in advance.

I added also a new option `scrollOverrides: { 2: introScrollOverride },` to override the scroll event on some sections, I used this option to make a blur effect on text in the second section.

2. Scrolling is not fluent, because after autoscroll to another section, you have to move your mouse to be able to scroll. Mouse wheel seems to be kinda frozen.
3. The section doesn't scroll to its end, maybe it is because of set `paddingTop`?

This is great plugin. Thanks!

I'm running into a problem with the SlimScroll functionality. I have a div hidden by default with `display: none` in the css. I then show it with Jquery `fadeIn()` when the user clicks a button. Since the div wasn't there when the plugin first rendered, The user can't scroll inside that section after the hidden div is shown. Instead of having an internal scrollbar to see the entire [new] content, the user jumps to the next section when trying to scroll. 

I understand this is not a bug. That is actually the expected behavior since the the div was initially hidden the plugin cannot account for its height.

What I really need is to have a method that could refresh the plugin. That way, I could simply re-render the plugin right after the fade in animation of my hidden div.

The `scrollOverflow: true` works really well for content already present on page load, basically I need something to recalculate that with a method or something.

Many thanks in advance :)

First, sory for my english :/

I have try this trick with rewrite 

<pre>function doneResizing() {</pre>

into 

<pre>$.fn.fullpage.reBuild = function doneResizing() {</pre>

This work fine when the site load , but when i load directly a slide i have the error :: 

<pre>TypeError: $.fn.fullpage.moveSectionDown is not a function</pre>

Note my code : 

<pre>
$.fn.fullpage({
    [.....]
      scrollOverflow: true,
      afterSlideLoad: function( anchorLink, index, slideAnchor, slideIndex){
                $.fn.fullpage.reBuild();

I think you need to test if the device support touch or not, instead of testing the device type, because there are some Win8 device with touch screen and others not.

So targeting that might be easier than introducing a new method to detect touch-device, seeing the info is already embedded in the reported UA-strings.

edit: like the source says, this part of the UA is only sent when the device is touchenabled and windows 8 or higher, windows 7 even on a touchscreen will never have this `Touch` part in the UA-string.

Setting autoscroll to false for just Windows 8 Touch devices _should_ be as simple as targeting the UA-string that comes with the `Touch` part.

Firefox(v30) - double finger scrolling works going down, swiping left or right makes the slider go up.

I'm going to have a go at fixing it over the weekend, I'll report back here if i find anything. thanks.

[It seems there's no way to detect whether you are using a touch device or not](http://www.stucox.com/blog/you-cant-detect-a-touchscreen/). It seems to detect only the browser's support for touch events.

Therefore, I believe the easiest solution is to avoid using the condition `if(isTouchDevice){` in touch events. It doesn't really make much sense. Removing it from the `addTouchHandler` and `removeTouchHandler` methods will make it work.

You would need to modify the plugin for that. 

Probably deleting this from the `doneResizing` function:

But not sure the consecuences of that right now. Neither I know how would the slides or sections with scroll (if used scrollOverflow) will behave. 

You could play with it, but the plugin doesn't support that.

However the 'height: auto;' appears to be doing the work, for if I give the properties 'overflow: hidden;' and 'height: auto;' I get the disabled scroll functionality (which is what I want), along with no scrollbar being shown. I don't know if this is working just for my case or whether it's a small thing that should be changed/given an option.

The one which could be probably avoided is the `height:auto;` or `height:100%`, as it was probably introduced when the sections and slides didn't have a defined `height` and were using `height:100%`;

153,2014-01-06 00:51:15,"Take a look at [this solution](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/46#issuecomment-26509996)

If you still want to use Lazy Load plugin, I would recommend you to ask on its [github issues forum](https://github.com/tuupola/jquery_lazyload/issues) as I don´t personally know how it works.

If you are using fullpage with the `autoScrolling:true` (which is the default option), take into consideration that the site is not scrolling normally, it is changing the `top` property of the site or adding a `translate3d` css3 effect which can be the cause of trouble with plugins which uses the scroll event, which might be the case with Lazy Load.
",alvarotrigo,2014-01-06 00:51:15
153,2014-04-25 16:26:13,"I had problems with lazy load, too, so I created this workaround (lazy load no more needed!):

1.) Inside your images **replace** attribute **src=""whatever.jpg""** with **data-original=""whatever.jpg""**

2.) Add following events inside fullpage script:

<pre lang=""javascript""><code>
$('#yourFullPageContainer').fullpage({
    onLeave: function(index, direction){},
    afterLoad: function(anchorLink, index){
        var activeSection = $('.section').eq(index -1);
        activeSection.find('img').each(function() {
            var imagePath = $(this).attr(""data-original"");
            $(this).attr('src',imagePath);
        });
    },
    afterRender: function(){
        var activeSection = $('.section').eq(0);;
        activeSection.find('img').each(function() {
            var imagePath = $(this).attr(""data-original"");

That's the way to do it with this plugin. Using callbacks. Lazy load plugins usually use the positions of the elements in the viewport together with the `scroll` event, which won't be fired using fullpage as it doesn't really scroll but it use the `top` or the `translate3d` CSS properties to create the scrolling effect.

So it doesn't matter to me which one you prefer, as long as it is consistent. Right now, the code has both spaces and tabs, as well as a few different formatting and indentation styles. It doesn't matter to me which way you decide to do it, but being consistent is very important so that other users are able to easily read and contribute to the repository to make the codebase better. It also makes the code super clean and organized, which is obviously helpful to people, especially new users reading the code.

I prefer spaces over tabs because it translates better to a variety of different text editors across platforms and keeps the indentation the same. So sharing the code is much easier and much more consistent.

As far as separating `){` or putting a space after css declarations, these types of things will make it much easier for other users to read or skim the code. There were inconsistencies with this formatting as well so my suggestion is to pick one and make it consistent. 

The last thing that I cleaned up in this pull request was any instance of `0px` because this is not a proper declaration.

A good code linter or beautifier will catch and fix these things, perhaps that is a good place to start.

141,2013-12-23 16:48:02,"I have following structure:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The initial page loads into section one (and sl-one is visible - good) but when I navigate right to sl-two (single event), the following is fired and confirmed via console:

1) slide sl-one leave - ok
2) section one, slide sl-two leave ??? we never left sl-two nor the section one?
3) slide sl-two load - ok
4) section one, sl-two load - ?? huh, didn't we just do this already but we are already in section and never left?
5) slide sl-two leave - huh? we never left this slide
6) slide sl-two load - this is the result we want but why twice?

I expected to see just 2 events fire, sl-one leave and sl-two load.  BTW, subsequent navigation works as desired its just the very first navigation that does this.  Same thing if I navigate left to sl-three.

If I navigate down to section two and then back up to section one, then navigate left or right, the events fire properly and as desired...i.e.

1) slide sl-one leave
2) slide sl-two load

For now I think my only way around this is to load into a section that does not contain slides, for example.

I wouldn't recommend it to you form the UX point of view, but if you still want to do it, I would create a public function inside the plugin with this content. Something like:

regarding my two questions:
1. what I was looking for was an equivalent of 'setMouseWheelScrolling' for keyboard, which I can use to activate or de-activate keyboard scrolling at anytime (inside 'afterSlideLoad', for example).

You can initializate the plugin with the option `autoscrolling: false` or make use of the method `$.fn.fullpage.setAutoScrolling(false)`

> Scroll within sections and within sliders using the arrow keys and the pageUp and pageDown keys

There's no way to do it within the plugin. This is consider a good practice for the user interaction. 

> Use touch events for mobile and tablet devices

Again as before, setting `autoScrolling` to false.

Here you have an example you can find in the available online examples:
- http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/normalScroll.html

And here you have a couple of examples available in the documentation of the use of fullpage with autoScrolling: false: 
- http://www.jennbeaupre.com/jb/index.html
- http://lawinenstift.com/

If you want to use buttons to move throw the sections or slides, you should make use of the methods available for it:
- moveSectionUp()
- moveSectionDown()
- moveTo(section, slide)

You can see how they work in [the documentation](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#methods).

One solution would be to disable the autoScroll functionality when it's being rendered on a mobile device. This would ensure a more user-friendly approach on mobile devices. 

Or increase the scrollspeed for fullPage.js to ensure slimScroll and fullPage's autoScroll don't compete for the same event (of course target these changes only on mobile devices to ensure desktop use won't be affected).

While using your script I found a strange thing if you use page 7 and 13 sections for example. On a desktop section 13 is displayed but on my samsung galaxy it shows section 12 as the last one. The same on an Ipad. Has anyone encountered the same bug like behaviour?

You can see for yourself if you have two devices: www.frango.info/#7thPage

On the desktop the last picture is 14. On a mobile device only 13. On page 5 I also use a lot of pictures but they are alle displayed correctly. Strange no?

thanks for your time,

Frango

Just to clarify though, the issue is with scrollable divs on touch devices, right?

The user cannot scroll through any content that is within a fullPage.js frame without inadvertently initiating the autoscroll to the next frame. Correct? 

In my case, the div within my frames that I would like to be able to scroll is a popup div, which has it's own callback when it pops up, so on desktop we were able to simply remove the mouseWheelHandler whenever the popup is activated, and add it back when the popup is closed.

And the issue with mobile is that it isn't as simple to remove the touchMove event when the popup is activated?

But it also seems that the fullPage.js `normalScrollElements:' option does not work on mobile devices. Is that also correct?

This is the first time I'm writing something in a forum and I'm sorry for that but I never felt like i could have any code worth to share.
I'm developing a web app tottally based in fullPage.JS for a pharmaceutical product, it uses a 3 layer parallax with oposite parallax when changing sections (it creates an awesome feeling of movement with the correct graphics) and I made it with very little modifications to Alvarotrigo code. 
I'm writing this post to share the solution I came to for the problem referenced here and specially to give my full respect and admiration to Alvarotrigo for this master piece of code, fullPage.js is simply genious and extremly powerful. Congratulations.
My web app acts entirely like a native application in mobile devices like tablets or iphones and it is also based on bootstrap so it really was a problem when I realized that none of the 37 bootstrap modals were working correctly in iPhone and small viewport tablets. Reading Alvarotrigo comments in this posts I just wrote this simple solution to solve this specific problem: fix bogus scroll of bootstrap modals in a mobile context just using the setAutoScrolling() method when bootstrap modals open and close. 
Integrate bootstrap modals (big modals with graphics and buttons for example) with fullPage is a simple process, just add '.modal' to the normalScrollElements (Alvarotrigo thanks for that again) and just make some changes in the bootstrap modal triggering system using Alvarotrigo code (again) that I found in one of posts:
Find the following code in bootstrap.js (v3.1.1)

I'm afraid i won't apply that effect on fullpage.js. I guess they did it in order to avoid problems with their animations mainly in the iphone 5C section of their site.

I personally find it inconsistent. If you use the navigation bullets to go to the section right close to the current one, that fade won't take place and it will slide, but not if you want to go to another section which is not the next or the previous one.

Also, that fading makes the user lose a bit the scenario, the reference of the dots... I don't see it as a good practice from the UX point of view.

You can see my project here: http://www.safetec.net/know-your-chemicals/

The problem is that when I activate a popup window any scrolling or swiping causes the sections behind the popup (the fullpage slides) to autoscroll like normal.

So my first attempt to solve this was to trigger setAutoScrolling(false) when the popup window opens, and then setAutoScrolling(true) when the popup window is closed. But with this configuration when I activate the popup (which is a transparent overlay) the website jumps immediately to the top section. And then when I close the popup, the site jumps immediately back to the section it was in.

BUT, to make it even weirder, if, while the popup is open, I scroll or swipe even a little, then when I close the popup, the site remains in the top most section. Meaning it does not jump back to the section I was when opening the popup.

This is very difficult to explain. So please check it out here: http://www.safetec.net/know-your-chemicals

I want the user to only be able to scroll within the popup content while the popup is open, without the website scrolling at all. And when the popup is closed, I need the user to remain on the section on which they opened the popup from. Does that make sense?

I can only allow public access for a limited time. So check it out as soon as you can.

What you could do, is maybe convert the function `addScrollEvent` to a public one such as `moveSlideUp` or `moveSlideUp` and move it to the top of the plugin code, after the options array:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And then, when you close your popup, call it again to add the scroll event again.

I've included the issue on this thread because it is related, but specific to touch devices. So I also opened a new issue. I assume it has something to do with the touch event vs the mouse scrolling events.

119,2013-12-05 17:37:22,"Hi alvarotrigo,

I'd like to have a fixed navigation for my project, which will contain both the unordered list of nav links, as well as some other elements and icons.

My hope was to wrap the unordered list within an HTML5 `<nav>` element, and then fix the entire `<nav id=""#myNavElement"">...</nav>`.

I'm confused how to configure this in the options. It doesn't seem to work when I designate the 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I'm not sure, but I believe this is because of the conflicting ways in which the plugin deals with the element designated as the `menu:` and the elements designated as `fixed:`. 

Any suggestions?

119,2013-12-05 17:43:24,"what is `#myMenu` in your code? If your menu is `#myNavElement`, then, that should be in the `#menu` option, which won't have problems to get fixed as it is treated as the  `fixedElements` option in that respect.

119,2013-12-05 17:51:02,"I think I just figured it out. It seems like the `menu:` option works just like the `fixedElements:` option. 
These are my options:

`anchors: ['firstPage', 'secondPage', '3rdPage'], menu: false, fixedElements: '#myNav'`

and my HTML:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Even though I don't designate the `menu:` element, my anchor links still work perfectly. `#myNav` is fixed, and `#myMenu` remains nested within `#myNav`.

When I designated BOTH `menu: '#myMenu'` AND `fixedElements: '#myNav'` the UL menu was taken out of the NAV wrapper, like so:

To fix this, you can either stop using autoScrolling or when you load another page verify that the overflow of the body is set to ""auto"".

and add this code in the header tag :

What I want is : when I scroll to the right then section3 effects of fullpage.js mouse wheel stopped working and when rolling the mouse inside the image section3 horizontal scrolling .

Currently, when I move the mouse to the next section3 and rolling it along the 2 activities : section4 has just rolled scroll inside section3 image.

Maybe when they stop to section3 of fullpage.js window scroll event , then click the first link in the scroll section3 section4 .

Very grateful if you could tell me more event stops the mouse wheel event fullpage.js recall how and when to move it to section4 .

Thanks you men !

106,2013-11-29 16:08:19,"The autoScrolling option is not to automatically scroll over the sections or slides, it is a way to automatically scroll with just one move of the mouse wheel or trackpad rather than the having to scroll manually.

This example is using `autoScrolling: true` as is the value by default:
http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/

And this another one, is using `autroScrolling:false`:
http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/normalScroll.html

If you want to automatically scroll the site without having to do anything, then you could use the callbacks for it together with public methods such as `$.fn.fullpage.moveSlideDown();`

For example:

What you could do, is use the `resize` method of jQuery,check the resolution and then call the [`setAutoScrolling`](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#setautoscrolling) method setting it to `true` or `false` as you wish.

103,2014-01-14 14:49:47,"@medhi, the padding is applied correctly. The height o the section will be always be the same no matter which padding you apply as the CSS property `box-sizing: border-box;` is applied in each section. 

The section is not shifted down. The content is getting overflowing and therefore hidden.

This way, of course, the more padding you apply the less space you will have to place your content and it will be more probably to get hidden in some resolutions. 

The only solution i see for this would be to apply `scrollOverflow` property in theses cases, creating an scrolling bar when needed...

As far as I understood you are using `verticalCentered`, but not sure yet how you want to center the content in your site. I guess you want it to be centered in reference to the vertical size of the section without padding? (which won't be centered in reference to the browser window)

If so, what you are asking for is not to force the `height` of the div with `class=""tableCell""` to have a predefined height. Right?

Then, this is an inconsistent behavior and it doesn't make sense from my point of view.

The user would feel stuck inside a section if this one has an internal scrolling bar as they won't be able to keep making use of the scroll wheel. (which they were very probably using to reach that section)

1. Is it possible to setup full page smooth scrolling? Scrolling without stops on slides ? And can I control the speed of it? If it is possible where I can setup this in the code?
   It is like at this page: 
   http://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/features/

86,2013-11-19 10:46:48,"Hi @michalcik ,

1 - You can use the option `autoScrolling` setting it to `false` and you will have a free scrolling site with the same functionality.

2 - In this plugin, each section will have the size of your window by default but, of course, you can make it bigger if you are using `autoScrolling:false`. In case you wanted to use big texts by using `autoScrolling:true`, then you could use the option `scrollOverflow:true` which would generate an scrolling bar for those sections with a bigger content than the window's height.

3- I'm not familiar with paralax, but you shouldn't have any problem. You should just initialize the paralax plugin inside the callback `afterRender` as specified [at the documentation](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#afterrender).

What i'm trying to achieve is a bit unconventional. vertical swipes/mouse wheel snaps and horizontal drag/swipe is a horizontal free scroll (no snap).

Ten ademas en cuenta que no se redimensionan las imagenes en ningun momento.  Para esto ultimo, y tal vez tambien para el tema del texto, lo ideal es usar media queries de CSS. Asi lo haces un poco mas a tus gusto.

Horizontal touch recognition was implemented some time ago therefore you can slide horizontally using touch devices.

If you want to avoid the arrows, just hide them with jQuery or overwritting their CSS styles using `display:none`.

[You can not control the visibility of the address bar in iPhone OS 7.](http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/safari-ios7-html5-problems-apis-review) 

Also, each device address bar or controls behaves differently and many times you can NOT take control of it.

If you want the top bar to minimize and the bottom one to disappear on scrolling, then use `autoScrolling:false`, but that will also show a wrong size for sections other than the first one.

When the address bar is not showing, and you touch to go to the next slide, the address bar appears, and the resize not working well... because the script catch the height of the device, not of the actual window size...

79,2013-11-13 10:41:09,"Ok, vale, now I see what you mean. 

If you enter directly to the website in landscape mode, then it works kind of ok. Only the bottom of the section exceeds the size of the browser window hiding behind the bottom bar.

If you enter in landscape mode AFTER having entered first in the normal vertical mode, then, as you said, the top and bottom bars are not showed at first but they do when you slide down, which causes part of the sections (bottom and top) to hide behind them.

I will take a look but it does't sound simple at all. As I said, this things are complicate to manipulate as depend on the devices and the version of its OS.

I would recommend you to use the option `autoScrolling:false` for touch devices if you want to avoid these problems.

Adding

There's an available method called  `setAutoScrolling` for that purpose.
You can set it to `false` to go back to the normal scrolling mode. ([documentation](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#setautoscrolling))

Also, you can make use of the option `scrollOverflow` setting it to `true` to create scroll bars for contents bigger than the viewport / browser window.
Here you have an example:

This could lead into a big problem if the user believes that the delay is too big, and decides to change it to 50 mile seconds, for  example.
Then, inadvertently for them, their site would be working wrong in laptops, Apple laptos using trackpad, Apple users using the magic mouse wheel... 

I believe the plugin should make sure it behaves correctly in all browsers/devices and giving it as an option breaks this idea.

I talk about users rather than developers because many people using the plugin don't have a good knowledge of jQuery, but, if we are talking about developers then I guess a solution for this could be setting a global variable in the plugin with this value, for an easy replacement.

Using an anchor link (#) makes the browser to look for any element in the site with an `id` with the same value to scroll automatically to it, which is the case.
The way to avoid this behavior is forcing another scroll to the top of the page, which could be accomplish like this in this case:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

**But**, as the `body` and `html` elements in fullPage.js have the attribute `overflow:hidden` in the CSS properties (in order to hide the scroll bar), then, the scrolling is not even possible with jQuery or javascript. 

I tried to do something like this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

`setAutoScrolling` is called automatically by the script one first time. Then, if you are calling it again on `afterLoad`, it should be the 2nd call.

The 3rd call seems to be on your `setTimeout`. I don't know why are you using `if $.fn.fullpage.setAutoScrolling?` as that function won't return anything and will always be false...

What the plugin does is taking off the padding size from the sections height when calculating its size and then applying the padding.

The JS runs the first flexslider in the first section on load.

Let me know what you think.

It doesn't happen on every refresh but it does seem to happen when clicking the flexslider navigation.

64,2013-10-27 19:43:48,"Really great component. Should become a classic in no time.
1. When the browser window is resized, the current page should update instantly along with the window resize. Currently, there is a delay, then a slow animation to reset the current page properly. It looks terrible. Can you please change this, or add an option (and make it default) FastResizeUpdate = true. Meaning, no animations to reset the current page/slide when resizing --- just do it instantly. It is one of the few missing features keeping me from building 2 client sites using this awesome plugin. I see some improvement by by changing 500 to 100 on line 658 ... in $(window).resize(function() ...
2. The other issue relates to resizing the background image proportionately. I use full page background images, but when the browser window is resized, the plugin fails to recalculate whether to use the height or the width of the image at 100% to properly fill the screen. This should be updated upon an window resizing, and re-focus (as you tab between other web sites, resize the window, the return to your site that has this component, the ""current"" div/page has to be reset instantly). 

To test what im saying, open your demo, go to section 2 (any section other than the 1st/top one), then resize your browser, you will see the messy animations struggling to update. I should not see other pages/slides -- i should only see my current page/slide being updated. It should be instant -- no animations. Animations should be used only when a user clicks a link, or performs a distinct movement (up arrow, etc.). That is, you animate his intentions to move/jump etc. All other updates and refreshes (non-user initiated) should be instant.

Seems both should be very doable.
Keep up the GREAT work. Thanks.
",acturbo,2017-03-10 16:10:47
64,2013-10-27 22:59:38,"Hello @acturbo, thanks for the reporting. 

About the first point you mention, if you change the 500 value to 100, problems arise if you resize the window slowly or doing small stops. Then it calls the resize function is called multiple times and the movement of the sections/slides become much more slower producing an even worst result. 
I will take a deeper look. I believe the solution might be using percentages instead of pixels and absolute positioned sections instead of relative ones. This of course, is a big change in the plugin structure and I would need to see it is convenient. 

In relation to your second point, I'm not sure to understand what's the problem. Could you add a [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.com/) for it? 
If you want a covering background, why don't you just use `background-size: cover` in your CSS styles?

   See the demo ... animations are very crisp (click on boxes in the bottom right).
   Demo: http://kirkas.ch/ascensor/#/Implementation
   Github: https://github.com/kirkas/Ascensor.js
2. Fullscreenr.js solves the background resizing issue perfectly. Very little code to review. It properly sizes background images. 
   Demo: http://nanotux.com/plugins/fullscreenr/index.html
   Code: http://nanotux.com/blog/fullscreen/

Hopefully these can provide some inspiration. Ideally, it would be your component with some of these features.

64,2013-10-28 00:40:00,"Ancestor.js is using the absolute positioning technique I named before.
Fullscreenr.js is an old plugin and I don't end up seeing a practical purpose nowadays apart from making full screen backgrounds work on IE 8. 
I haven't taken a look the initialization or usage of it, but I guess it could be used somehow initializating it on the ´afterRender´ callback.

Anyway, again, I don't see the purpose of implementing such a thing in fullPage.js. 
Nowadays [all modern browsers support ´background-size:cover´](http://caniuse.com/#search=background-size).

After studying the behavior of Ascensor.js with a full page background image using ""cover"", i see the problem. With a background image, the Ascensor pages don't appear to slide in as fullPage does. The behavior is more of a ""wipe"" effect, which i definitely don't like. I much prefer the fullPage animation showing a page and background sliding in naturally. I'm going to dig into fullPage to see if i can tweak the page resize to be smooth. Thanks for responding, and keep up the great work.

I've read this and the other topics here referenced, but it's not clear to me (english is not my native language) if the plugin now works like (for example) this page: http://www.apple.com/it/iphone-5s/ , where if you have a large enough screen you can see that when resizing the window the other ""pages"" are never shown so that no animation is needed to adjust their sizes following the resizing, I think this would be the correct behavior. A solution could be to have the divs containing the pages direclty follow the body and using the following css to position them: 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This way the div takes all the space available (ex: http://jsfiddle.net/67eEg/ )

Regarding the text and images proportional dimensions I agree it's better to leave that to the website coder to set them with media query, because any design can have different needs.

What you suggest would be a huge change in the plugin. It is not that simple.

It shouldn't be a problem. You can add the needed jquery in the ´afterRender´ event.

I think this site's paralax has to do more with [GASP](http://www.greensock.com/get-started-js/) & their own hand-written code than fullPage.js.  

Seems some people expect fullPage to be a feature-rich 'turn-key' solution for all their paralax needs.  But fullPage is just a simple slideshow maker, with extras that you can expand upon with the user's hard work.
",tomByrer,2013-12-18 15:02:14
59,2014-08-03 18:01:29,"I've just found something interesting,
since fullpage.js uses slimscroll (there is no good doc about).
I saw on slimscroll source it binds the event slimscrolling, there is also slimscroll (for bottom and top)

So you can use for your parallax code :

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

see http://rocha.la/jQuery-slimScroll.

Hope this helps somebody (it would be nice to add to the fullpage.js doc since it uses slimscroll plugin).

EDIT: It would also be nice to have access easily to slimscroll configuration options (like wheelStep for example) :)

59,2014-11-11 17:16:42,"Now from version 2.4.4 you can combine fullPage.js with any parallax plugin if you use the option `scrollBar:true` as you can see [in this demo](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/scrollBar.html#secondPage).

> **scrollBar**: (default false). Determines whether to use scrol bar for the site or not. In case of using scroll bar, the autoScrolling functionallity will still working as expected. The user will also be free to scroll the site with the scroll bar and fullPage.js will fit the section in the screen when scrolling finishes.

This way the plugin will really perform the scroll of the site as all these kind of parallax techniques expect.

You can take a look at this example:

Maybe this could be added as some kind of ""padding"" feature inside the plugin to make things easier and avoid having to create an extra wrapper for each section. I will think about it.

The project I am working (after talking to the client) didn't really work
with a fixed header and footer unfortunately and so I had to add the header
and footer into the first and last sections using the slimscroll
functionality for the footer - which in the end doesn't work that bad,
thanks.

I have been working with flexslide in the sections and setting the carousel
height to window height to get a full page background in on each carousel
slide. This would be another great addition to your plugin as you already
have a slider and are setting the window height, but I wanted the carousel
page navigation as well as the directional navigation and a carousel load
function.

I did have bootstrap as a dependancy and adding one of the fullpage options
adds a class called 'table' which conflicts with bootstrap. Might be worth
changing this class name to a more unique class name for future releases
maybe? table-js or fullpage-table.   (just a thought)

Once done I'll send you a link to see what you think.

You are right. The naming is very generic and can generate CSS or even JS conflicts with some JS or CSS frameworks. I should use some kind of prefix. Probably `fullpage` as you said. (although this will increase a bit the size of the generated minified version of the plugin)

Maybe something like `f-` ?

You could make use of the event  [´moveToSlide´](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#movetoslide) after the plugin initialization.

For example:

I should have mentioned I already tried that at http://tg.mioriticus.ro/slides. What I'm trying to do is for the page to open directly with that section.

I duplicated the moveToSlide and scrollPage functions to jumpToSlide and jumpPage. I removed the timeout and set the scrollingSpeed to 0. It's a hack, but solves my needs for now. 

I tried adding a parameter to moveToSlide and scrollPage functions, but that didn't seem to work.

You could delete the option `options.easing` too, as you are not using it in `jumpPage`.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The anchor link (#) still being added at the top on Load, so bookmarking it will make the site to scroll, but well, maybe its ok for you.

Also, this won't work using `css3:true` option. As you didn't delete the easing class from the animation.

You should do:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I will anyway try to take a look at it later on.

46,2013-10-17 14:24:21,"Also, I would recommend you to load the images on the fly in order to avoid such a big loading of the site. 

Simply use the `active` class added on each section / slide when is active: 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Or if you want to deal with callbacks you could use the callbacks `onLeave` or `afterLoad` and then do something like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

If you want to make it more generic instead of having to create a condition for each slide or section, you could use this instead:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And in your CSS had something like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This way the images won't be load when the user access the site but when he is about to arrive to one section.
It might be better to have the first slide always loaded (as it will be shown on scrolling) but maybe the not the rest of slides until the user reaches the section. (or the previous section or whatever)

Just an idea :)

Now that I've finished the choice and work on different pictures, I've got a few last questions before (finally!!!) to put my website online : http://www.gabrodrigues.com/teste
- I think there is a problem with the page resize on android mobile devices when putting the phone on horizontal and then vertical, the height don't change and is keeping the first height called.
  Do you know where does it come from ?
- I was also wondering how to change the font size on mobile screen ? Buttons, logotypes and texts are to small to read or interact on it while it is not a real problem on tablets and computer screens.

Then, let me know if you still having that problem.

About your second point, this is beyond the plugin topic. You would need to use media queries or use the viewport meta tag in some specific way. You could also detect whether is a mobile phone or not and load another CSS style sheet. Google about it. I can not advice you on that.

By the way, I still recommending you to upated to the last version, there has been many changes internally which makes the plugin behave much more better. You won't have to change anything, just download the new version and import it.

Also, you are importing the minified version and the full one. Just import one. You are slowing down the loading of your site and adding unnecessary code.

I would also recommend you to load the first slide image of your sections on load, so the user will always see the first image and the transition correctly. Then, you can still load the rest of the slides dynamically as you are doing. 

About the second point. You can call the resizeMe method on load using the `afterRender` callback.
I´ve posted a solution in this post:
https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/81#issuecomment-28414009

Notice that you have to add the ´resizeMe´ function outside the plugin to be able to call it on the callback.

Follow-up comment here for somebody who just launched the first `fullpage.js` site: this CSS-only based solution has multiple drawbacks - image loading on arrival is too slow, flicker is clearly visible both on leaving the previous and arriving on the next slide. This could possibly be improved with adjusting `.active` class timings: more eager for the next slide, and lazy remove on previous slide.

I really would love to use same functionality for both vertical sections and horizontal slides.

May be it is better to have sections with built-in slides, but with one by default? In order to make possible:
- navigate to certain slide inside a section by hash address
- pagination of slides in a section with active status
- full page screen animations in slides, out of screen animations (now its problem because of the: .slides {overflow: hidden;})
- afterLoad callbacks of slides
- may be add option to use transform: scale() instead of resize text
- option for infinite slides (like http://jqueryfordesigners.com/jquery-infinite-carousel/)

In order to do so you don't need to use AJAX or dynamically add new sections/slides. 
You could make use of callbacks for that.
In [this comment](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/46#issuecomment-26509996) I explained how to do it with images but you can also apply it to anything else by loading it with jQuery using `afterLoad`, for example.

41,2014-01-20 16:44:03,"Ive handled the keeping people on the splash page by disabling scroll and arrow navigation until they click the 'begin' button, which only appears after everything has loaded. 
As for the removing of slides, my design changed and I no longer need to do that, but the issue I had is that if you removed a slide using afterLoad or onLeave then the slides would jump one down, because one above it was removed. I dont need that solved or anything but that was initially my issue. 
",XstiX,2014-08-14 10:39:47
41,2014-01-20 18:37:29,"Ok i found a solution that works fine for me.

I named the sections id ""section_`anchorName`"" and added a data attribute to the slides that should be loaded later called `data-url` to store the url.
- `onSlideLeave` to preload the next slide
- `afterSlideLoad` to load the slide if its called direct via url `#section/slide`
- `afterRender` to add a class (in my case `loading`) to all slides with `data-url`

I know it's not really a dynamic adding of slides but it helps you to keep the traffic low by loading the slices when they are needed.
",painis,2014-08-14 10:39:47
41,2014-01-20 20:49:31,"@painis just be careful with loading data into the section dynamically. You will probably have problems if you are using the option `scrollOverflow`. The feature won't work correctly with those slides. 

If you are just avoiding the load of background images, I would recommend dealing with CSS to solve the problem.

A future function to avoid scrolling right or left, up or down, [might be created](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues/630) so you will be able to have empty sections / slides which would be able to be filled with content whenever you want.

I see that it doesn't make sense for conventional mouse wheels, so it would be better to give the scrollResistance a value of 0 to 1 which is a delta from 1 to 120 or so, so there won't be any conflict with conventional mouse wheels.

Wouldn't it be better to add a counter rather than relaying on the delta value?

I don't have a magic mouse (or an apple product for the matter), but if the magic mouse reports only 1 event with a different delta for 2 clicks (instead of 2 events like every mouse I tested yet), then the counter variant is kinda problematic for the magic mouse.

What would you recommend to unify the delta values?
",alvarotrigo,2013-12-18 15:00:33
37,2013-10-23 22:59:26,"seriously after a bit of thinking... I think you shouldn't... in the end people can change scroll behaviour of the OS

also you got those flick movements on touch devices, where you can hardly decide if he just wanted to flick down a long text in a contained scoll area, or wanted to flick down to a different slide

you could probably go something like, on each scroll check if the contained scroll area is already at the bottom/top and the user is scrolling towards that direction (ignoring delta) switch pages, if not block page switching for a fraction of a second, but do not block scrolling

if you want to unify the delta... just log it on a couple of different OS and browser combinations with a real mousewheel and compare the values... the math is/should be easy
basic usage is done here and is rather easily achievable
then, if you feel like it change scrolling behaviour of the OS (for example windows lets youset how many lines of text to scroll on a mousewheel ""click"")
compare again to previous values, see if it affects the delta, if it does you probably have a hard time to provide a solution for people who in fact did change this setting
then get a mouse with a ""flywheel"" and check if the delta stays constant, or if they did something like mouse acceleration for the mousewheel
furthermore test if smooth scrolling options have any effect
maybe some of this is overkill... but there's probably no way to know for sure untill checked

luckily, by now touchpad scroll events should be taken care of because they kinda simulate a scrollwheel ;)

if you manage to find patterns for all of these things, congrats you're probably the first one to achieve this feat
then again there is a jquery mousewheel plugin, of which I don't know if it maybe already did all the necessary work

oh it would be so much easier if one could work with the scroll event ^^

I am planning to use this thing in production. But I found two issues that were possibly deal breaker. 
- Complex anchoring mechanism
- Ability to redirect when hash not found

My initial thought was to rewrite the portions concerned with anchor mechanism but wisdom (or procrastination? :smiling_imp:  ) prevailed. 

In my use case, only the homepage is ""full-paged-scrolled"", each section on the homepage represents one post/article (which itself is a share-able URI). But the homepage only shows 7-Recent featured articles.

If the URI to an article which was featured in past is received, but not currently featured, I want some mechanism to be able to redirect it to the proper location rather than confusing the user by showing him the homepage only.

As for committing to the last version: If you have a better strategy planned for managing anchors, you can simply ignore this one, else let me know if you plan to merge, I'll put in another pull request.

31,2014-09-05 14:04:53,"I have a similar issue with anchors/data-anchors. My problem is that the urls of the slides need to have a special format because of SEO requirements and some other things. The form of the slide urls has the form `[content-type]/[id]/[content-title]`, e. g. `partner/18/example-company` or `product/4/very-cool-product`. My sections are created using a list of terms which do not exist in real/are not used somewhere else. Thus the sections urls are virtual and can be whatever is needed.

You take the hash, split it by `/` expecting the first part being the section identifier and the second one as slide identifier. This is not compatible with what I need. My suggestion is extracting the line

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

from `scrollToAnchor()` and `hashChangeHandler()` into a function `parseHash()`. Then add a _parseHash_ callback or _onHashRequest_ event to the options. If the user has provided a function call it expecting an array in the same format as now, otherwise use you default logic.

I believe it is belong the plugin as this should be done with CSS queries and generating different image sizes for each of the defined resolution the designer wants to play with.

The problem with the given example and the iPad images is already there on desktop computers. It has nothing to do with tablets or mobile devices. The way I designed the demo page is not ready to deal with windows smaller than `720px`. It was a design decision as any other which designers take when they create any site.

I could have solved it with CSS queries and it would have worked as expected on the tablet devices as well.

Download the sources from the repository in order to test it. And don't forget to add the folder `vendors` in the same directory as the plugin.
You don't need to do anything extra, just adding a big text in some sections to test it. 
I'm afraid I couldn't make it work over IE 8 (not sure why...) and it won't work as expected in the landscape slides, only in sections.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

It's not a big problem but I think a lot of people try to avoid editing libraries if it isn't necessary. Maybe add a fallback variable to set script path or just include `jquery.slimscroll.min.js` outside `jquery.fullPage.js`?

I can partially confirm this bug (or another). I have `resize` and `touchScrolling` disabled . Scaling down browser window works ok, scaling up causes that the section has only 50% of window height. This is not critical bug but maybe it's related with that you've described.

The option `touchScrolling` doesn't exist anymore. I changed it for `autoScrolling` in some of the last commits. This way is not restricted to touch devices but can also be configured in desktop computers.

I'm doing a site for a friend who is asking for exactly this - but only related to touch/swipe gestures. One a laptop where the scroll wheel controls the pages, the default behaviour works a treat. On sites that have more than a few sections (in my case, about 8), it becomes frustrating to keep swiping up. His and most of our testers' behaviour was to keep swiping up repeatedly (like scrolling through a long contact list) and the feedback was that the site was unresponsive because many of the swipe gestures were ignored. Obviously the site isn't unresponsive, but ignores gestures whilst the sections are in transition.

I believe this would be a useful feature for touch gestures & on mobiles. Thoughts?

If you make a fast search through this issues forum, you will realize some users complain about the opposite behavior. They don't want to scroll more than one section when scrolling the wheel twice or three times instead of one. They want to scroll just to the next or the previous one.

A delay of 600 milliseconds was added to avoid unwanted behavors on Mac trackpads and some mouses. 

If you provide a solution for both cases, I'll listen to it. But the queue won't work for most of the users and won't be a good solution for all kind of devices either. (you would very probably have unwanted results on Mac laptops and magic mouses)

Respecto al tema del `isMoving`, tiene sentido en el mousewheel para que no se pasen 2 secciones de golpe y sobre todo en ordenadores MacBook Pro con el trackpad. 

Este problema en cambio no existe con las teclas puesto que nadie pulsa la tecla seguidamente durante el tiempo que dura la animacion y es muy poco probable que se pase de seccion. 
Lo mismo sucede al pinchar en un link, a veces quieres moverte rapido por la pagina pero no vas a tener el problema de que te pases de secion pinchandno en un anchor link.

I'm using Chrome, Magic Mouse and its going craaaaaazy. scrollDelay set to 5000, still nothing.

What do you recommend dear author?

This issue is from a year ago and the problem was solved using the `scrollDelay` that you mention.

If you are increasing it to 5000 and still having issues, then you are probably missing something.

Check the Javascript console and let me know if there's any error there.

12,2015-01-31 19:53:02,"Hi Alvarotrigo!

Thanks for the great plugin. I am using it in my rails 4 apps in combination with turbolinks. 

On first page load (welcome page) scrolling works fine with normal speed, but when I go to another page and then go back to the welcome page scrolling has gone crazy. It seems like the sensitivity is really high then... (the anchors in the url change very fast and the slide jumps way too far) - this is in google chrome (see version below)

In Safari (8.0.2 (10600.2.5)) the sensitivity is always really high. 

I thought this was in line with the current thread, therefor adding my 2 cents here. Unfortunately I do not have a website to show you at the moment .. and do not have same problem on your demo page

Using with:
Trackpad (slow and fast)
jquery.fullPage.js v. 2.5.6 (non-minified version)

It sounds to me like you are changing the scrolling speed to a very fast one.
You can look for other plugins, but **none will solve you the problem in a proper way**. As much as they can do is forcing a delay of around 700 milliseconds to 1 second when you arrive to the section. That's how fullPage.js was working before and [many people complained](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=scrolldelay) about that compulsory delay, so I improved fullPage.js to work more intelligently. 

Currently there is no way to detect the start or end of a scroll with kinetic scrolling. And I haven't seen it anywhere.

The damned macbook trackpad has the same gesture for horizontal scrolling as it does for history back/forward. This has always bothered me about the macbook, but usually its usable (if not somewhat touchy) because they at least give priority to scrolling if it detects the mouse if over a scrollable element (like an HTML element with horizontal overflow for example). You can see where the problem lies when its done programmatically then. Scrolling to the right to initiate the next slide is fine, but scrolling back is nearly impossible without activating a history back. I have a few ideas I'm going to try out to see if I can solve it.

Take into account that this is CSS3 and won't work in old browsers, such as IE 9 (http://caniuse.com/#search=linear-gradient)

As in any site, you will be able to define the styles you want for your site and this will include the sections the plugin creates.

Just add an identifier for your sections (id) and start playing with your CSS.

This is the used HTML markup:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This is the CSS I used:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I personally don't know if it makes sense to add the gradient option in the plugin as it that's more about design and the plugin can not take care of all the design aspects (font color, background image, background sizes, background positions, font sizes, text align... )

All of that could be accomplish by making use of CSS for each section and it seems to me the simplest way.

I have noticed that the site does not resize on orientation change (landscape to portrait, forex.). I´m not sure about my iOS devices are pretty old. It was tested on a first gen iPad and first iPod touch (iOS 5.1 / iOS 6 resp.).

Also, the sites does not respond on gestures/touches/swipes. Are these events allowed by the plugin?

Anyway, I really love the implementation you did here, Alvaro. My congrats and aim to improve it!

Thanks!

2,2013-10-03 16:39:20,"@BeatLaG thanks! And yeah, you are right. The resizing is not implemented on mobile or tablet devices yet. 

In relation to the touch events, well, right now the plugin enables the normal scrolling of the site for these kind of devices by default. I'm thinking of adding them in a future as it solve some problems I've found on Nexus or even on iPad in relation with the URL bar and the calculation if the window `height`.

You are more than welcome to add more value to the plugin :)

awesome the last commit. The site works great now on swiping and centering contents on orientation change, at least on my iPad. I will take a look to the new deploy and I will try to find some method to help with the horizontal scroll on swipe.

Thanks for your fast response and keep the good work! :)

1,2013-10-01 08:55:01,"@aithonaltis I am afraid it is not possible right now. It is designed to scroll the whole page and to take the height of the window.
Take into account the aim of the plugin is to create a full-screen site.

As far as you follow the structure needed for fullPage.js, the plugin should work properly.

The problem is when you use it with fullpage.js, bootstrap grid system doesn't work. If you want Maybe an image:

Can you read the content of the div? This is the problem, without fullPage.js bootstrap grid system works great. The problem is in mobile devices, not in desktop.

I try deleting the class section of this section but it dissapear (of course).

1,2014-09-12 12:01:49,"@erknrio you have to give me a link of your site or reproduce int a site for me to test it in my phone.

Your fiddle looks good in my phone... and in my desktop... Therefore it is not a way to reproduce your error.

Fullpage.js shouldn't interfere with bootstrap at all. If you are using the latest version of fullpage.js, all the classes are prefixed with `fp-`.

1,2014-11-05 23:14:41,"Has anyone been successful using BS3 and ""Scrolling inside sections""? From what I can tell it conflicts with    the latest javascript library: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js

""Scrolling inside sections"" seems to rely on these two libraries to work. Which in turns break some of Bootstrap 3 components. 
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.9.1/jquery-ui.min.js

Is there an updated version of ""Scrolling inside sections"" or is there a way to use the various jQuery libraries together?

1,2014-11-05 23:30:03,"@kingk1974 In case there's any conflict between bootstrap and jquery is nothing to do with fullPage.js. (but i really doubt there's any conflict at all)

Also, fullPage.js doesn't require the UI library, that's an optional library to use if you want to use certain jQuery animations in case css3 animations can not be applied (such as in IE 8 or IE 9)

You are not even including the jQuery library and fullPage.js is a plugin for jQuery...
