Although I don't have much knowledge of gzipping and bad use of ternary operator mentioned in previous comments, I have a use case of ternary operator. Please bear with me if it turns out to be bad practice : )

Some really simple if statement could be saved by using ternary operator

We could have 

`var count = i  %  2   ?  6 :  7;`

instead of 



In this case, I was rendering a ""hive"" with several lines of hexagons. The odd number of line has 6 hexagons each line, and the even one has 7. 

Similarly, another example:



If Free is true, .free class will be added to the element.

Personally, logical operators are readable unless they are overly used. Furthermore, considering about the spacing issue of squeezing several really simple if statements into for loops, logical operator might be a better approach in my opinion.

- What does ""the condition list would be huge"" in your first sentence mean?
- Since `index` is part of the looping state of `aList`, it really should be a _property_ of `aList` (i.e. `aList.index`) rather than a separate variable.
- There's a bug in your example. Your `change()` function does a _pre-increment_, so the first `change()` call actually returns `aList[1]`, i.e. `B`.
- I think a more level-appropriate tip for JSTips would be a _loop generator_ function that takes an array as input and ""enhances"" it with self-looping capability:


- [Optional, for extra JSTips :+1:] You've looped to `E` in the above example, then someone calls `aList.pop()` twice, so `aList == ['A','B','C']`. How do you properly handle the next `aList.next()` or `aList.prev()`? (Your original `change()` function doesn't handle this correctly either.)

The cleanest and most reliable way to resolve this is to close this PR and reset your own state:
1. Copy out any changed files from your old fork to another directory.
2. [Delete your old fork on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-a-repository/).
3. Delete the local copy of your own fork.
4. Re-fork JSTips.
5. Copy in all the changed files you saved from [1].

Going forward, you really should create a separate branch for each PR. Here's what I do:
1. [Update local fork from the main repo](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
2. Create and checkout a new branch: `git checkout -b tipXX-update gh-pages`
3. Make and commit edits.
4. Push this branch to your fork: `git push upstream tipXX-update`
5. Go to your forked repo page. There should be a Compare and Pull Request button next to your new branch. Click it and follow the instructions.

Ironically, your ""better approach"" is also the only one of the three chunks that commits the ""sin"" you explicitly warned against: `handler` closes over the same `element` that `handleEvent` binds it to, thereby creating a circular ref even if `handler` doesn't actually use `element`!

You can see it for yourself by setting a breakpoint inside `handler`, then triggering the event it's bound to and inspecting `handler`'s scope your browser's debugger. In Chrome DevTools, for example, it's listed as part of the Block scope. Doing `console.log(element)` inside `handler` is, of course, another way.

> `handler` closes over the same `element` that `handleEvent` binds it to, thereby creating a circular ref even if `handler` doesn't actually use `element`!

Exactly. But it's not a problem because neither `element` nor `handler` is referenced by any other object. Also, when you call `destroy` to remove event listener, the circular reference got broken. Here is the [bin](http://jsbin.com/vikojo/edit?js,console). You can use `debugger` statement inside `handle`, turn on Chrome DevTools, click `run` and look for the `handler`'s scope.

Of course you can use the Chrome DevTools Heap profiler in the Profiles panel or the Timeline tool to determine if there is a memory leak.

It's now just a distraction from the central point of your tip (an elegant way to manage lifetimes of event listeners) and breeds confusion amongst people like me who tend to read stuff fairly carefully; I won't be the only person to go ""hang on, you just did what you said was a Bad Thing!""

Moreover, removing that paragraph actually makes your text flow better. Your tip then starts by pointing out the way many folks do event handlers nowadays, along with the three one-liners, then the next paragraph (with a slight adjustment in its wording) points out that all these create new anonymous function objects, and therefore cannot be removed when they're no longer needed.

306,2016-03-15 15:53:33,"I'm in two minds about @tracker1 's suggestion. Yes, it's elegant, but it also monkeypatches a ""quasi-root"" in the DOM hierarchy (i.e. an object whose interface is inherited by almost the entire DOM) with a function name that's short, sharp and subject to multiple interpretations. Since it's not part of the official DOM spec, there's a non-zero probability that a third-party UI library comes along and overrides your `HTMLElement.prototype.on()` (or worse, something further up the hierarchy like `HTMLButtonElement.prototype.on()`) with a conflicting and _hidden_ (read: undocumented internals) implementation. That makes for fun **WTF** debugging sessions, especially six months down the line when you upgrade a library and suddenly it or some/all of your event handlers (or both) stop working.

One simple but inelegant way to avoid this conflict is to take a page from the Java package naming convention and implement, say, `HTMLElement.prototype.co_jstips_on()`. It's not completely foolproof, but it's much less likely to cause weird problems.

The other is, of course, not to monkeypatch at all.

",nmrony,zenopopovici
294,2016-03-03 02:17:26,"@nmrony I think there's some confusion regarding the recent discussions in #293 .

It's not that Safari on iOS devices has a brain-damaged `Date()` that requires full ISO 8601 timestamp strings; it's that **single-digit days and months** aren't reliably parsed across platforms. For instance, the venerable Firefox on _all desktop and mobile platforms_ fails to parse `2016-2-28`, but no JS implementation of `Date()` in recorded history has ever choked on `2016-02-28`.

The key statement should probably read as follows:

To get the Unix epoch value (seconds since midnight 1 Jan 1970 UTC) of a specific date, pass `YYYY-MM-DD` (4-digit year, 2-digit month and day) as a parameter to the `Date` constructor.

`Function.prototype.call.call([Number|Array|Object],undefined,n)` is the same as `[Number|Array|Object].call(undefined,n)`,not `Function.prototype.call(undefined,n)`.The second param is the function to finally execute, and the first param is just a `call` function.

`Function.prototype.call(undefined,0)` is not the same as `Function(0)`.

The former calls function `Function.prototype` with `undefined` as its context and `0, [undefined, ...]` as its arguments. This will return `undefined` (function `Function.prototype` always returns `undefined`).

The latter calls constructor `Function` with only argument `0`. The result of such call is a newly created function with `0` used as it`s body, i.e. it`s almost the same as `function(){0}`.

The thing is `call` function calls some function in some context with some arguments. If you invoke ""call"" as member of some object (e.g. `Function.prototype.call(...`) then this object will be used as a function to be called.

If we can get some of most renowned guys in the JS community to contribute to this project by providing their tips, including the library/framework creators and committers/contributors, the people who drive the EcmaScript and web standards, we can expect the tips to be of high quality. And if we are not able to get them to contribute to this project, at least we can request them to be part of a review panel for the tips, if there is ever one review panel created. 

Another way would be to take a look at some of the awesome blog posts written by these people and translate it to tips format and publish them here with their permission/ attribution. This would make sure we can gather the quality content present already in multiple sources and collate them in this repo.

251,2016-02-19 03:24:33,"@loverajoel If we're talking about licensing tips code, the GPL is absolutely the wrong license, due to this line at the end of the license file.

> ""The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.""

The GPL will ensure that businesses or anyone developing commercial software will not acknowledge  using JS Tips (if they're paying attention).

Look around the [npm registry](https://npmjs.org) and you'll see the MIT is far and away the most common license used in open source JS.

Because MIT is not compatible with GPL, some times a dual license model is used.

If the plan is to offer tips code under any license, contributors need to be made aware of that and explicitly agree to the license(s) used.

On the other hand, if you are only applying the license to the JS Tips site (not the tips code), one of the Creative Commons licenses is probably best.

For more on the various licenses see:

[tl;dr leagal](https://tldrlegal.com/)
[Open Source Intiative](https://opensource.org/)
Wikipedia has a [comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses) of free and open source licenses.
[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/choose/)

Licensing can be a sticky issue, hope this helps.

We can change the license now, but it will be very hard to do that later.

1. There's no clear gain in using `lastIndexOf()` instead of `indexOf()` but maybe a 3% performance improvement. I can't see any problem on using it either.
2. I can't see the point of the third param suggestion, maybe I didn't understand what you are trying to suggest about the closures and the use of the self keyword is misleading and confusing.
3. Adding a nested ternary operator won't make the function more optimal but confusing and nested ternaries are considered bad style. On the other matter, if I remove the `else` statement the resulted ""sorted"" array will be something like this:

190,2016-02-06 18:27:48,"@loverajoel hi, I updated the tip and included a way to deduplicate Objects. Added some references, among of them, the SO answer you provided. I also added the way to dedup using a `Set` which is really cool I think!

I did leave out anything about performance though.  First of all I couldn't reproduce the statements made about performance in the SO answer. Even though it's true that in theory a sequential search (using `filter` with `indexOf`) is less performant that doing a direct lookup (hash table), I believe the engine is heavily optimizing methods like `filter` and `indexOf`. In my test cases the implementations where a hash table was used, were actually the slowest.
Second, IMO it's a bit out of scope. I mean, it's all about tips and I think when we start to talk about performance we start to complicate things because we also need to include info about how we tested stuff and show specific results to prove this. I think this could be a post by itself.
But if you think this would be important to add, maybe you can advise me how to approach this to keep it simple.

Please review my changes when you have the time and let me know what you think.

157,2016-03-11 17:39:58,"@zenopopovici I was making a big post with big explanations, but I think ""shorter is better"" ahahah :sunglasses:.

So, I think this tips need some big changes : 
- some text error (for ex. : in the description which is almost the same as the one from the source it is from, ""example of a person"" should be changed).
- I also think it could be easier to read if we alternate one block of text with one block of code 
- then a link to babeljs (https://babeljs.io/repl/) could be used to have the whole code tested
- also I'm not a big fan of this kind of OOP-like programming style, I would rather recommand the ""module pattern"" (by the way the source is 4 years old, I think it's kinda gross and may be too old to be used as a ""tip"" since JS has changed a lot since then; but it's just my opinion)
- finally I think this lacks of basic explanations. Clearly, it's a tip for people who are new JS developers, and not explaining things like the differences between privileged / public methods makes me sad. I also think it should be written somewhere that, since it's not real OOP, JS public methods != OOP public methods (JS privileged is more like OOP public then JS public).

123,2016-02-06 11:43:13,"@jknaresh well AJAX is 'secure' out of the box but it depends on what you are referring to. For example you can't just make an AJAX request to another server without both parties opting into using a **[CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)** request, this means that hacker sites can't steal your GeoCities session just by making an AJAX request.

Now the security mentioned above is Same-Origin Policy(**[SOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy)**) which prevents an untrusted Origin speaking to another Origin from doing things you didn't expect with it. Forms and links can cross Origins but they can't read or execute the code on the other origin. (Origin is just a fancy name for Hostname, Port and Protocol _So https://example.com can't speak to http://example.com._)

So I assume you are more on about how to secure a conversation between your users and the server itself?
Most of the security features actually need to come from your server:
- [HPKP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning)
- [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy)
- [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)
- [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)

One exception is [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) token protection which usually requires some setup on the client side to enable. It prevents the user sending requests they didn't expect from their own browser. This can happen as any Origin can POST a form to another, meaning a user can be on example.com and end up deleting their Habbo Hotel account as the hacker has sent a form over to Habbo which you are logged into.

Essentially CSRF tokens work by using code that can only be read by users on the page to prevent privileged requests from happening. This is similar to Cookies in that it is sent back to the server on the request however it's different as it's usually sent in a HTTP header by code that recognises the page has loaded and the user actually made that action.
This comes as a pain for AJAX requests as it usually means taking server response headers and injecting it into your AJAX request headers to give a unique key back to the server.

Other than that you could use [WebCrypto](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status/API/WebCrypto) to store the data of your users on your servers encrypted without you even having the keys.

This was a little hastily written but yeah, let me know what sort of thing you are after securing and I can expand on that.
",jonathanKingston,jknaresh
123,2016-02-21 18:14:53,"@zenopopovici sure crypto doesn't really make sense as a tip despite perhaps hashing examples which are far less technical.
The other topics I mentioned are not really simple tips that could be copy and pasted etc. SRI probably is the only simple suitable for a tip where a few lines of code can demo how to prevent against hijacked servers.

In the end, I guess people want to see some unknown, (more or less) useful tricks here. Not being 100% accurate on the title to have a use case, but brining across a new trick was my main intention here.

FYI: That test is no good.

Engines may memoize the results of a function when static code analysis shows that it is side-effect free and has deterministic output and when the same input is repeatedly fed into the function. That is exactly the case here: the test uses a single constant, picked before the clocked test loops, and the function under test produces deterministic results.

At the very least use a test that employs a function with side-effects. For instance; prepopulate an array of floating point numbers, where each value, when truncated to an integer, would point to the next index to pick from the array in a next iteration of the test.

However, you really should stop putting stock into micro-benchmarks like this altogether, because they've been proven time and again _TO - NOT - WORK_ with modern JS runtimes.

So if you want to say it is a right way to assign **null** to param when you want to say it is empty - that's correct, if you want to say it is a good practice - also correct, but saying:
1. You shall **never expect** in practice someone assign **undefined** meaning property is empty

The previous bullet point make it clear that if you care for bytes you can use `undefined` for not defined values semantic, but if you don't care then you don't need to and you can use `null`. Again, it depends upon the context of what you are doing.

> typeof is broken for empty references?

It depends on what you consider ""empty references"".

""If something works sometimes, and sometimes it does not, and there is a better option, always use the better option"". If one does not agree with this principle, then there is no point to continue the discussion.

`typeof` rules are complicated for some values and useless for others (like checking if a property exists).

When you say `typeof myObject.name` do you expect the value 'undefined' or that there is no property? There is no way to tell because it only returns 'undefined' either way. The only way to consistently check if a property is in an object (which is what tip 10 refers to), is using `obj,hasOwnProperty`:



See that both `typeof` returns `undefined`, a falsey value, but only `hasOwnProperty` makes it right, returning a **false** (not falsey) value.

I'm not sure about what you proposed, these are my thoughts:
- Today frameworks are an important part of JS and it's a way to learn the language and best practices.
- JS Tips is not focused on beginners only.
- Share knowledges about famous frameworks will let that beginners know the frameworks/libraries and avoid common mistakes.
- It's hard write 365 tips only for javascript without frameworks, the idea it's include tips about tooling, dev environments, frameworks and more things related

",loverajoel,tevko
18,2016-01-06 18:08:34,"Hi @loverajoel, thanks for taking the time to start a project like this. These are my opinions but maybe this will contribute to the discussion a bit.

There is merit to both approaches. However, I'll add that it is jarring to come to a project named ""Javascript Tips"" and see the first tip is about manipulating plain JS arrays followed by a tip about a deep (to me) aspect of Angular, a framework with which I know basically nothing (yet). This followed by a tip on React, again a framework I know nothing about.

So to me that kind of defeats the purpose of a project named ""Javascript Tips"" because it is neither accessible to newcomers nor is it a useful reference (""cookbook"") of actual JS techniques. Because a newcomer will immediately be thrown into the deep end of the pool by seeing Angular as the second tip, and a veteran will have to wade through what is essentially a random collection of tips from what may be such a huge variety of frameworks that it isn't very helpful at all.

Personally I would look for see Angular tips on a page titled ""Angular Tips"", for React tips on a page titled ""React Tips"", etc. And I would think a page titled ""Javascript Tips"" would be designed to help us all become better at _Javascript_ itself. :)

These are just my thoughts, I'm sure others may make better points than me. Maybe have one pure-JS tip each day with one ""bonus"" tip each day that is about a framework? That way everybody gets the pure-JS tip and can still pick up some tips from other frameworks along the way.

With all that said I think the motivation behind the project is fantastic and would be very helpful to people. So way to go on getting this started, however it turns out. :)

It seems beneficial to aim for inputs and outputs into a function that do not change data type. Introducing logic to handle a change in an argument's data type because the argument value isn't type-safe makes functions unnecessarily complex and prone to runtime errors.

## Using conditional breakpoints to log data

If you wanted to log to the console a value each time a function is called, you can use conditional break points to do this. Open up your dev tools, find the function where you'd like to log data to the console and set a breakpoint with the following condition:



This always evaluates to false, so it will not pause the page thread when it's hit, but it will log data to the console. This can also be used to count how many times a function or callback is called.
## Printing a function variable to console

Have you ever logged a function variable to the console and weren't able to just view the function's code? The quickest way to see the function's code is to coerce it to a string using concatenation with an empty string.

## TL;DR;

Below is the line with which we can create 0...N range.



Lets break down this line into parts.We know how ""call"" function works in javascript.So in ""call"" first argument will be context and from second arguments , it will be list of arguments of function on which we are calling ""call"" function.



This will retun sun of 5 and 6.

map of array in javascript takes two arguments , first callback and second thisArg(context).Callback is taking three arguments , value , index and whole array on which we are iterating.so common syntax is like : 



Below line create array of given length.



Putting all parts together below is the solution.



If you want range 1...N , it will be like this.

markdown file following the Jekyll format. I also add the `to the top` link so the people can jump to the top of the page conveniently.

It seems that using regular expression is a little bit faster then using `split`, and `split` will create a new array in memory but regular expression not.

And `/[^, ]+/g` can deal with string like `""p1, p2 ,p3,     p4""`, it will ignore the space in the string, this is better then using `split` :)

124,2016-01-21 10:24:52,"@mallowigi @strcmp Yes, you are right:). I think `forEach` is more readable. This tip more like a promise of code style in a project:) It may reduce the code size, and use the regular expression to do other things. See [this](https://github.com/RubyLouvre/avalon/blob/master/avalon.js#L3340), and [this](https://github.com/RubyLouvre/avalon/blob/master/avalon.js#L1113) is use to instead of `.split(',')`.

They are produced directly from the `README.md`, so the markdown is GFM, but I know that jekyll's native GFM support is not exactly one-to-one with the GFM that gets rendered through Github directly, so there may need to be some adjustments.

E.g.



If you look at the ECMAScript source code, the hasOwnProperty method is ultimately checking for undefined.

I will add to this point though, that it is often agreed that native JavaScript methods are slower than doing the check yourself. There's quite a lot of extra handling that goes on in the `hasOwnProperty` method that isn't needed if you're just checking the property against undefined.

@loverajoel: A small point that may be worth mentioning about this as well. If you use `hasOwnProperty` on the window in IE7, it errors.
