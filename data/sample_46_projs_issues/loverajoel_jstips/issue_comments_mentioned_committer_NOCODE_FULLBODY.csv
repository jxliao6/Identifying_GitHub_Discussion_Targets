And if we are not able to get them to contribute to this project, at least we can request them to be part of a review panel for the tips, if there is ever one review panel created. 

Another way would be to take a look at some of the awesome blog posts written by these people and translate it to tips format and publish them here with their permission/ attribution.

251,2016-02-19 03:24:33,"@loverajoel If we're talking about licensing tips code, the GPL is absolutely the wrong license, due to this line at the end of the license file.

> ""The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs.""

The GPL will ensure that businesses or anyone developing commercial software will not acknowledge  using JS Tips (if they're paying attention).

Look around the [npm registry](https://npmjs.org) and you'll see the MIT is far and away the most common license used in open source JS.

Because MIT is not compatible with GPL, some times a dual license model is used.

If the plan is to offer tips code under any license, contributors need to be made aware of that and explicitly agree to the license(s) used.

On the other hand, if you are only applying the license to the JS Tips site (not the tips code), one of the Creative Commons licenses is probably best.

For more on the various licenses see:

[tl;dr leagal](https://tldrlegal.com/)
[Open Source Intiative](https://opensource.org/)
Wikipedia has a [comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses) of free and open source licenses.

1. There's no clear gain in using `lastIndexOf()` instead of `indexOf()` but maybe a 3% performance improvement. I can't see any problem on using it either.
2. I can't see the point of the third param suggestion, maybe I didn't understand what you are trying to suggest about the closures and the use of the self keyword is misleading and confusing.
3. Adding a nested ternary operator won't make the function more optimal but confusing and nested ternaries are considered bad style. On the other matter, if I remove the `else` statement the resulted ""sorted"" array will be something like this:

190,2016-02-06 18:27:48,"@loverajoel hi, I updated the tip and included a way to deduplicate Objects. Added some references, among of them, the SO answer you provided. I also added the way to dedup using a `Set` which is really cool I think!

I did leave out anything about performance though.  First of all I couldn't reproduce the statements made about performance in the SO answer. Even though it's true that in theory a sequential search (using `filter` with `indexOf`) is less performant that doing a direct lookup (hash table), I believe the engine is heavily optimizing methods like `filter` and `indexOf`. In my test cases the implementations where a hash table was used, were actually the slowest.
Second, IMO it's a bit out of scope. I mean, it's all about tips and I think when we start to talk about performance we start to complicate things because we also need to include info about how we tested stuff and show specific results to prove this. I think this could be a post by itself.
But if you think this would be important to add, maybe you can advise me how to approach this to keep it simple.

157,2016-03-11 17:39:58,"@zenopopovici I was making a big post with big explanations, but I think ""shorter is better"" ahahah :sunglasses:.

So, I think this tips need some big changes : 
- some text error (for ex. : in the description which is almost the same as the one from the source it is from, ""example of a person"" should be changed).
- I also think it could be easier to read if we alternate one block of text with one block of code 
- then a link to babeljs (https://babeljs.io/repl/) could be used to have the whole code tested
- also I'm not a big fan of this kind of OOP-like programming style, I would rather recommand the ""module pattern"" (by the way the source is 4 years old, I think it's kinda gross and may be too old to be used as a ""tip"" since JS has changed a lot since then; but it's just my opinion)
- finally I think this lacks of basic explanations. Clearly, it's a tip for people who are new JS developers, and not explaining things like the differences between privileged / public methods makes me sad. I also think it should be written somewhere that, since it's not real OOP, JS public methods != OOP public methods (JS privileged is more like OOP public then JS public).

FYI: That test is no good.

Engines may memoize the results of a function when static code analysis shows that it is side-effect free and has deterministic output and when the same input is repeatedly fed into the function. That is exactly the case here: the test uses a single constant, picked before the clocked test loops, and the function under test produces deterministic results.

At the very least use a test that employs a function with side-effects. For instance; prepopulate an array of floating point numbers, where each value, when truncated to an integer, would point to the next index to pick from the array in a next iteration of the test.

However, you really should stop putting stock into micro-benchmarks like this altogether, because they've been proven time and again _TO - NOT - WORK_ with modern JS runtimes.

> I'm not agree with your last point

The previous bullet point make it clear that if you care for bytes you can use `undefined` for not defined values semantic, but if you don't care then you don't need to and you can use `null`. Again, it depends upon the context of what you are doing.

> typeof is broken for empty references?

It depends on what you consider ""empty references"".

""If something works sometimes, and sometimes it does not, and there is a better option, always use the better option"". If one does not agree with this principle, then there is no point to continue the discussion.

`typeof` rules are complicated for some values and useless for others (like checking if a property exists).

When you say `typeof myObject.name` do you expect the value 'undefined' or that there is no property? There is no way to tell because it only returns 'undefined' either way. The only way to consistently check if a property is in an object (which is what tip 10 refers to), is using `obj,hasOwnProperty`:



See that both `typeof` returns `undefined`, a falsey value, but only `hasOwnProperty` makes it right, returning a **false** (not falsey) value.
",FagnerMartinsBrack,loverajoel
62,2016-01-13 21:10:29,"@loverajoel 

> fixed d885967

If `myObject` has a property with value `0` it will return falsey and not enter the condition, therefore it is also not ok to check if a property is present with the `if (myObject['name'])` code.

18,2016-01-06 17:26:09,"Hey @tevko thanks for your suggestion!

I'm not sure about what you proposed, these are my thoughts:
- Today frameworks are an important part of JS and it's a way to learn the language and best practices.
- JS Tips is not focused on beginners only.
- Share knowledges about famous frameworks will let that beginners know the frameworks/libraries and avoid common mistakes.
- It's hard write 365 tips only for javascript without frameworks, the idea it's include tips about tooling, dev environments, frameworks and more things related

But we can talk about it maybe I'm wrong, and only js is better for the project
",loverajoel,tevko
18,2016-01-06 18:08:34,"Hi @loverajoel, thanks for taking the time to start a project like this. These are my opinions but maybe this will contribute to the discussion a bit.

There is merit to both approaches. However, I'll add that it is jarring to come to a project named ""Javascript Tips"" and see the first tip is about manipulating plain JS arrays followed by a tip about a deep (to me) aspect of Angular, a framework with which I know basically nothing (yet). This followed by a tip on React, again a framework I know nothing about.

So to me that kind of defeats the purpose of a project named ""Javascript Tips"" because it is neither accessible to newcomers nor is it a useful reference (""cookbook"") of actual JS techniques. Because a newcomer will immediately be thrown into the deep end of the pool by seeing Angular as the second tip, and a veteran will have to wade through what is essentially a random collection of tips from what may be such a huge variety of frameworks that it isn't very helpful at all.

Personally I would look for see Angular tips on a page titled ""Angular Tips"", for React tips on a page titled ""React Tips"", etc. And I would think a page titled ""Javascript Tips"" would be designed to help us all become better at _Javascript_ itself. :)

These are just my thoughts, I'm sure others may make better points than me. Maybe have one pure-JS tip each day with one ""bonus"" tip each day that is about a framework? That way everybody gets the pure-JS tip and can still pick up some tips from other frameworks along the way.

With all that said I think the motivation behind the project is fantastic and would be very helpful to people. So way to go on getting this started, however it turns out. :)

They are produced directly from the `README.md`, so the markdown is GFM, but I know that jekyll's native GFM support is not exactly one-to-one with the GFM that gets rendered through Github directly, so there may need to be some adjustments.

62,2016-01-12 07:38:27,"@igor-galchevsky: you have a valid point, but the problem you've raised also applies to the other mentioned methods.
E.g.



If you look at the ECMAScript source code, the hasOwnProperty method is ultimately checking for undefined.

I will add to this point though, that it is often agreed that native JavaScript methods are slower than doing the check yourself. There's quite a lot of extra handling that goes on in the `hasOwnProperty` method that isn't needed if you're just checking the property against undefined.

@loverajoel: A small point that may be worth mentioning about this as well. If you use `hasOwnProperty` on the window in IE7, it errors.

59,2016-01-10 12:18:34,"Hi. This project is going to be really big. So, I've been thinking about categories. What if tips will be divided by categories like:
Plain JS
ES2015
Angular JS
React JS
etc..

It will be easier to find tips for your needs.
@loverajoel What do you think?

And yes, maybe this is not a ""tip"" as what is expected on this repo. I'll let @loverajoel decide. (you can close my PR without merging it, I don't mind)
@strcmp Yes indeed, I think everybody ran into this issue. Maybe this is a tip on itself?

Come on xD!! @loverajoel you need to clear this up, what kind of developers are the tips intended for?  noobies, stackoverflowers, advanced, out for 10 years?
",homer0,loverajoel
25,2016-01-21 06:30:35,"@strcmp **I'm not trying to offend you nor everyone else**; I quoted that because it was really something weird to say; and I was honestly asking @loverajoel ; and complaining about the labels?  I was referencing in part to [this joke](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/3dxkka/computer_programming_to_be_officially_renamed/) and, you were never a noobie?, or you never needed stackoverflow?; I have no problem admitting it, I learned about `var` scope a lot after learning js; and a BIG part of my Angular learning came from stackoverflow.

Please don't think I'm against your point of view nor @chtefi tip; please check the first point of my first comment, I don't think the tip is good because it's practically quoting the documentation, just google `forEach javascript` and you'll get the same kind of content. 

Maybe you are right and my question regarding ""what kind of developers are the tips indented for?"" should've been ""what's the type of tips you expect?"", a tip that it's practically documentation about the language is a good tip?

Again, sorry if you thought I was trying to start a fight, the labels part was wrong, but you have to agree, the `10 years` part was funny :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
