1118,2016-12-24 14:00:56,"@SET001 this technically doesnt have anything to do with `node-http-proxy`. This has to do with handling multiple SSL certs from a single `https` server. You are correct in that using `SNICallback` is the right approach. You should search for more examples and try it out yourself. I found [this](http://blog.sammauldin.com/configuring-https-with-node-js-startssl-and-sni/) blog post and improved their example below.


",jcrugzz,SET001
1118,2016-12-24 16:23:35,"@jcrugzz , thanx for you respond. I think it has to do with `node-http-proxy` because I need to proxy multiple sub-domain calls to multiple servers running each on different ports. Something like this:

https://a.foo.com -> 127.0.0.1:3000
https://b.foo.com -> 127.0.0.1:3001
https://c.foo.com -> 127.0.0.1:3002

also I have a certificates for each of this domain.

`SNICallback` will be called each time new connection to any of this sub-domains appears and I don't get how to proxy that connection to appropriate local server.
Also I'm lucking experience with express and node.js so I may miss something obvious here",SET001,jcrugzz
1118,2016-12-24 18:26:39,"A * based cert would make this easier ;) but doesnt matter either way. @SET001 check out the documentation as it gives examples of this. The proper cert will be handled by the SNICallback. You need to then proxy to a different `target` based on the `req.headers.host`. You can store a them similar to the certs above.

1058,2016-09-12 12:27:33,"@eezing, yeah, I tried a variety of options. See my first post on this thread. Keep-alive performance was definitely the worst option, but I need it for server-sent events (though I do have an alternative idea for that).

So I went ahead and automated the full benchmark process:
https://github.com/dtjohnson/proxy-benchmark
The code spins up 3 AWS EC2 servers on-demand (one for the upstream, one for the proxies, and one for wrk). It then runs through a suite of benchmarks. The results are viewable here:
https://dtjohnson.github.io/proxy-benchmark/

Here's an image, which is fairly consistent with the one above:

This tool should make it easy to iterate on the Node proxy and see relatively quickly the performance implications of various configurations.

A number of next steps to try:
- Proxying headers (the current Node piping just sends the status code, no headers). I expect this will hurt performance.
- SSL
- Gzip
- No keep-alive
- Piping the sockets. There is an intriguing looking piece of code showing piping the underlying sockets here: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_event_connect. I'm curious how that will perform.

Also, it adds some meaning to the type of the option:
- boolean `false`: disable the option
- object: advanced configuration
- string: shorthand for `{ '*': value }` configuration

And I am pointing out that behaviour is not as per the docs because ""the callback API"" means ""call back"" when it's either done or aborted.
If you aren't interested in correcting that mistake in the README and renaming that word into something  more appropriate like ""error handler"" then I don't care.

2. The parsing of the response body in order to grab the value to set on the header will inherently impact response time.

While I'm still looking at a way to be able to inject in a transform/duplex stream into the post proxy response, I haven't had the time to explore that territory which could potentially be a solution to my first point. There is no solution for the second point.

The current solution for this is do manually proxy and parse your response stream without using this module, until i figure out a way to do the modification streams.

I think our use case and the issues we are seeing are getting lost in translation.

@whatknight and I are on a team that's developing a single-page application. During development, the app is served on `localhost`. As we need to interact with backend APIs on different domains, we are using this proxy on the server side to proxy XHR calls out to the various APIs. Custom proxy logic allows us to extract the intended endpoint via a parameter and set that as the proxy target.

As `Host` is `localhost` for these requests, we were manually building the correct `redirectHost` and utilizing the `hostRewrite` functionality to ensure things stayed in line.

We can solve this problem by rewriting the `Host` header to the `target` host. This is reasonable enough, except that you are technically supposed to set `X-Forwarded-Host` to the original `Host` value. Frameworks like Rails, however, will default to using `X-Forwarded-Host` as the base for the `Location` header, which leaves us back at square 1.

",jcrugzz,damonmcminn
798,2015-04-02 09:06:03,"@jcrugzz No problem! I don't believe there is a use case for an empty string... It was an accidental discovery when I changed a regex that is used to strip the first path from `req.url`:
https://github.com/damonmcminn/api-proxy/commit/7dda2413535c5d5c1be0f574dde8ee69cd827fa7

The stripped path is used to identify what server to proxy the request to (so I can serve multiple APIs off a single validated domain i.e. api.damonmcminn.com) e.g.:
`api.damonmcminn.com/nutrition/green-turtle => localhost:50000/green-turtle`

The original regex only matched when a trailing slash was present, so `req.url` would be rewritten thus `'/path/' => '/'` but as I wanted to match regardless of trailing slash, I was erroneously rewriting `'/path' => ''`.

I am no longer rewriting `req.url` to an empty string but provided the fix in case someone else inadvertently does (or wants to).

We default to `connection: close` when there is no `agent` passed in to work around a bug in node core when we set `agent: false`. We default to setting `agent: false` to begin with as it enables the operating system itself to handle the number of sockets that get opened.

Subject:        Re: [node-http-proxy] Unable to proxy multi-part form 
(#760)

@todkap 
1.      Check the node docs 
2.      If the server you are proxying to is handling the actual form data 
(not your proxy server), you only need to parse it with that destination 
server. You can avoid the dance with the multi-part parser in the proxy 
itself
3.      If 2 is true, then there would be no need for connect-restreamer. 
Otherwise the code looks like it would behave appropriately but your test 
case did not even test if it did.

760,2015-01-02 17:29:44,"@todkap Ahh ok. So it seems that when you don't handle the `write-continue` case when the client sends a 100 request, it must fast-laned even when proxied where the .`on('socket')` event doesn't even allow headers to be set. Im looking to see where this happens in node core as this is kind of interesting. 

But my recommendation here is to put back the logic you had detecting the expect 100 request which was the problem I was inferring previously. I mistakenly made you change the code so that the 100 request was being proxied (because of how middleware works I guess or the writeContinue not happening automatically). You want to proxy just the payload and have your proxy-app tell the client to send the payload so that it can be proxied to the proper destination. I believe that is what is causing the setHeader error.

758,2014-12-22 16:28:59,"@yleemj use the [`prependPath`](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/blob/master/lib/http-proxy.js#L41) and set it to `false`. Then just provide the path you want to proxy to in the target URL.
",jcrugzz,yleemj
758,2014-12-23 17:22:08,"@yleemj Just for posterity, `req.originalUrl` and `req.baseUrl` have zero impact on how the request is proxied. `http-proxy` only cares about the `req.url`, the options you give it and the `target`. Now I'm still unsure why manually setting the req.url to `/` changes other behavior but I have provided an `ignorePath` option which will ignore the path that is given by the incoming request. Will this solve your use case? Your latest description honestly made your use case less clear.

",jcrugzz,goldfire
757,2014-12-22 21:10:38,"@goldfire sorry for causing you trouble, since it seems like these were my changes. One difference appears to be that `socket.end()`  is called in the error callback, which you do as well, so I think `socket.end()` is called twice. I'm not sure if that would be an issue, though. Can you see any other details about the circumstances of the failure? Does it disconnect when failover is happening, or during normal working operation? Can you find any commonality among users seeing the issue (e.g. browser or OS)?

It's definitely possible that one or more of the conditions under which sockets are closed is too general. My guess is that it would be bcd8a564a802512c90df20353ca341a1d8c84501, since you already had the change in c62766391e54069c7cf82f0135536aeabad7cd90 in your own error callback. I can't think of circumstances where that would be the wrong decision, but you might instrument the code (read: console.log) to see which of these is causing your disconnects, and then maybe we can figure out why the disconnects are incorrect.

It seems to center around [this](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/blob/master/lib/http-proxy/common.js#L61-L74) logic which to me seems impossible to be `null` but I'd love to be proved wrong :).

745,2014-12-01 03:27:02,"@codeuniquely For the first point, that is correct. The path of the incoming request will be used.

it seems like what you want here is to conditionally use the `bodyParser` rather than on EVERY request that comes through your express server. When the body of a request gets parsed, its no longer contained in the `req` stream object so that data does not get passed along when you proxy the request. Try avoiding using the `bodyParser` and `connect-restreamer` at all and see if you can successfully proxy the request as you intend.

didn't dive too deeply into the code but it looks like by the time proxyRes emits res is already sent/sending? (headers at least)

if proxyRes events fired sync before res sending started it should be possible to do this without leakage since the original proxyRes is torn down prior to creating the followup proxied request.

this would also address @DesignByOnyx 's usecase since you could abort the original proxyRes and then just pipe your stream directly to the original http res.

I actually have keep-alive disabled between the proxy and the origin server intentionally due to the current architecture and some issues with the origin server but would like to have keep-alive between clients and the proxy server for efficiency.

My current workaround is to listen for the `proxyRes` event and set `Connection: keep-alive` on the proxy response (so it will be copied to the client response) when possible.  Overwriting the `Connection` header in the client request had caused my checks for client compatibility to fail (since it always appeared that the client was sending `Connection: close`), but after discovering this issue I just set another property on the request with the original value of the `Connection` header which I can test in the `proxyRes` listener.  It seems to work well.

So I'm set, but it may take users with less debugging and HTTP experience a while to figure out what is going on, or to even realize that they are not getting HTTP keep-alive to clients.

I have the below code working; in that scenario:

// Create an HTTP tunneling proxy
var proxy = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});

I had been using a target as a deep path, something like `http://localhost:3000/api/`, and my proxied paths were read from `req.url` so they were often something like `/user/login`. While `path.join()` handled this properly, your code would create `http://localhost:3000/api///user/login`.

Understandably there shouldn't be a trailing slash in the target, but it is very common for there to be a leading slash in the proxied path (from req.url), and this commit broke that case as well with a double slash.

It is a bit in the grey zone, but I think the safest bet would have been to have it disabled by default, users wanting to use the new feature would have been forced to enable it manually. For instance, before this feature existed, many people created its own third party code for adding it, this code usually left the target with the complete path since it was not necessary to parse it just to remove it.
Anyway, it is too late now for anything so pointless discussion other than flagging that since http-proxy is so critical in many deployments, maintaining backwards compatibility should be taking very seriously.

1. For producing something like a digest on message bodies that are too long to buffer into memory, you could attach an event listener to `proxyReq` and then attach a `data` event listener to the incoming request that will digest the data and, when finished, call `proxyReq.addTrailers` with the appropriate digest header.
2. For message bodies that can be buffered, you could do the same -- except set `options.buffer` in the `proxyReq` handler to some stream that also gets populated by listening to events from `req`. There may be a nicer API that could be exposed for this, but it seems like it would work as is if you needed this behavior. But again, that's just from a quick glance, I didn't write any code to test this.

Edit: Actually, it looks like some tweaking would need to happen to allow `options.buffer` to be set in the event handler. Maybe something similar to what @jcrugzz suggested could be added to allow a transform stream to be inserted between `options.buffer` or `req` and the `proxyReq` -- or this stream could always be present and, by default, it performs no transformation.

However, as soon as do something like this:

614,2014-04-07 14:45:45,"@jcrugzz So here is where I'm at after messing with this over the weekend; I've placed the following server code up onto a public EC2 instance so you can test it yourself (to rule out the possibility of internet effects):



The public ip address of the server is 54.209.167.233

When I request http://54.209.167.233:3000/ in my browser (I'm using the [Advanced REST Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo?hl=en-US) for chrome), I consistently get a response between 60-120ms. 

If I run the following code, both cases respond for me in roughly the same amount of time (about 100ms each):



However, if I run the following example, and then request the response from localhost, I get times in the 800-2000ms range:



For good measure, and it illustrate that I don't think the root cause is necessarily _specific_ to http-proxy (though certainly something it is doing is causing the delay over the base http implementation), I provide the following additional example which uses [mikeal/request](https://github.com/mikeal/request) to the same effect:



This is as simple as I can make the cases and still illustrate the problem. Clearly it has something to do with EC2, but the fact that the http requests come back in a reasonable amount of time makes me think that it also has something to do with the way http-proxy (and [mikeal/request](https://github.com/mikeal/request) for that matter) are handling requests at the Node.js level.

I'm going to go ahead and bring this up in the mikeal/request forum as well, to see if any others might have an idea what might be going on. I'll keep the server up and running as long as necessary to troubleshoot the issue.

Can you take your example and turn it into a minimal failing test case? It should be reproducible by a simple node server using `socket.io` as well.
",jcrugzz,olingerc
612,2014-04-02 10:10:47,"@jcrugzz 
Thanks for the reply. I have tested some more. If I stay in a complete node environment as you  suggested, v1.0.3 works fine [(here)](https://github.com/olingerc/http-proxy-testcase) . So thats already a good thing, except I need a python backend :-/

As soon as I switch to the python socket.io backend, keeping the frontend the same, v1.0.3 gives the errors. The server switches to polling over socket.io after a few seconds, but the websocket itself is not setup. Reverting to v1.0.2 on the frontend, without changing anything on the backend, makes everything work again with the python backend. I simply use `npm install http-proxy@1.0.3` and `npm install http-proxy@1.0.2` to switch between versions. All other dependencies are fixed.

So I conclude:
- The frontend setup is ok
- Since all dependency versions except http-proxy do not change, it sort of has to be http-proxy, sorry
- The python backend works correctly with http-proxy v1.0.2
- The python backend can not setup a websocket with v1.0.3, but successfully switches to polling. Maybe incomplete headers somewhere?

I can not exclude an error in the python backend which maybe became apparent due to v1.0.3 being more strict? I'll investigate more and post some minimal python code. FYI, the backend is based on Flask and  [(Flask-SocketIO)](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO).

I can confirm that [this line](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/blob/master/lib/http-proxy/common.js#L55) is the culprit. Commenting it out makes v1.0.3 work fine.
",olingerc,jcrugzz
612,2014-04-02 10:51:35,"@olingerc super weird, there shouldnt be any reason the python backend just doesn't accept a request with `connection: close`. The problem with reverting this change is that it can cause sockets to leak since in the default case we do not use an [`agent`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent) and node core http is broken in this regard.

So we have two possible solutions here. The first one is that I want you to see if a change on line 54-55 to the following makes a difference.



If it does not, I would try using an [`agent`](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent) with your proxy so that it properly keeps the socket alive and is managed by node versus the OS. I would just recommend increasing the `maxSockets` value to a good sized number so you don't get throttled by socket pooling.

Let me know what you come up with.
",jcrugzz,olingerc
612,2014-04-02 16:35:22,"@olingerc the reason this ""fix"" is in place is due to node core not properly closing sockets in some cases when there was no agent. Hopefully there will be no others with python backends as it was necessary for others.

To answer your above question, the second one is better and there is no downside to increasing the # of sockets. It prevents you from limiting the # of sockets you rotate through and potentially block the ability to proxy depending on your traffic. (it will block pretty quickly with only 5 which is the default on the global agent)

gist#2: i first connect to proxy on port 3010, which then routes my request to amazon via another proxy on port 9010. this should work, but doesn't. things work if i make the change suggested in my previous comment.

603,2014-09-11 13:06:59,"Hi @jcrugzz,
I can't seem to get this right. I want to proxy all request made to `localhost:3000` to an api server `someserver.com:port`and this works fine from home. At my office, we have a corporate proxy which makes everything harder. I figure the toProxy attribute is what I want, but I cannot get it to work. This had happened for the ´mikeal/request`library where the fix was to use



How would I configure your lib to do the same? The following gists show how this works from outside the corporate proxy and also how routing to local addresses works fine behind the proxy.

572,2014-02-03 20:05:18,"@jwalton if you plan to receive heavy load, you should be specifying an agent with a large amount of sockets (enough where you wont run into the case where you run out of file handles). Regardless, if you get to this point, it is an indicator you should probably scale to multiple servers. At nodejitsu we use an agent for our load balancers and specify around `320,000` for `maxSockets` in the agent. 

One thing we cannot assume here is that it will be an `http` agent and the reason the default is set to false is because we do not want people just getting started to hit the caveat of having a default socket pool of 5. The `agent: false` covers the widest range of use cases and we will be in the proper situation when `node 0.12.x` hits.

A request can take the same options as the server but thats assuming the same cert is used for making the request (when as i think about it may be a false assumption but IMO whoever is creating an `https` server and `https` proxy should be doing them separately).

I think the main use case is not using the `options.ssl` in for the listen function (which is not called when you are just using it as a proxy), but exactly where you noticed it in `common.setupOutgoing`. This allows us to correctly make `https` requests using those same options. This also works with self signed certs if we pass in a custom agent. In this case you just need to set maxSockets to a reasonably high number so you aren't blocked by socket pooling 5 sockets as per default.

Correct me if I'm wrong here, but in the case where the `socket` errors, we cannot re-proxy with that same socket. So it would make sense to have a different error function in that case that just returns the request if thats even useful? Cause it seems the connection is just FUBAR if we hit that case and we just need to kill the things and let someone know.

559,2014-01-22 21:49:02,"@jcrugzz @yawnt 

Here's my thought.  There are two ways we could go.  Either http-proxy should itself take care of this, by reacting to 'error' on `socket` by ending `proxySocket`... or http-proxy should give the end user access to `proxySocket` and let it do its own error handling.

I think the former is probably the way to go. First of all, it's more or less necessary to do this error handling, and we shouldn't make it easy for users to accidentally cause a leak.  Secondly, it's already the case that the ws `stream` phase doesn't give much control over the way that `socket` and `proxySocket` are connected (eg, it doesn't let you interpose some sort of transformation).  If we add an API for that later (or the user overrides the `stream` phase entirely) then sure, it would make sense to also give the user control over the error handling semantics. But because http-proxy doesn't offer that control, then it makes sense to do the automatic right thing.

Working on a PR now.  One thing that confuses me: it looks like there's a straight-up bug in the stream pass: it takes its server and head arguments in a different order from how they are passed in!  Is there a test suite that should be catching this?  (Our current production use of http-proxy/caronte is based on an old commit from back when caronte used EventEmitter2 which doesn't have this issue.)

However, I was disappointed to find out how hard it is to check-in anything
in this project (maybe it's true for all the other projects, I don't know).
I have a list of dozens of fixes and improvements, and this is only the
first of them, and the easiest and most self evident.

It's great that there is a proxy module for Node, and it was very kind and
generous of its developers to develop it for us.
But based on my own experience with other proxies (especially Apache's
mod_proxy, which I'm familiar with its source code very well), the current
status is very preliminary, it still has to pass light-years to become even
just close to mod_proxy, and it's despaired that even the easiest and clear
fix is so hard to apply.

And even now, after convincing the maintainers that this specific patch is
OK, I'm still puzzled what exactly I should do (from the technical point).
People said ""what's the problem? do this and that, and that's all"", but for
a Git newbie I'm afraid, especially when it's not my own project and I
don't want to do things that I wasn't suppose to do, and when my name will
be put on it forever in GitHub archives. I'm not even sure that this
specific message is personal to you or it shows to anybody else...

I don't want anybody else to apply it for me, so I just asked a friend,
living near me, to sit with me 10 minutes and do it with me (so the next
time I'll have the confidence to do it alone), but I must apologize that it
will take several days till we meet. He is a GitHub guru, maintaining many
projects there.

Regarding a fork: no, I don't want to do it. I have my honor and
appreciation to the developers of this project, and I want this project to
succeed, together with them. I was involved in many other Open-Source
projects in the past (but not in GitHub), and have never forked.

The question of ""What is buffering in node.js?"" is a big one. Within `http-proxy` the above statement referred [to this](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/blob/master/lib/node-http-proxy.js#L204-L257) implementation to work-around lack of buffering in node.js core before `0.10.x`

In `http-proxy@1.x.x` the statement is no longer in `README.md` because we assume `node@0.10.x` by default and thus all buffering is handled there.

527,2014-09-24 17:36:44,"@jondubois You should listen on the error event for the proxy so that you can handle the errors and return proper responses when hitting this case. It is most likely triggered because there are not anymore sockets to be used and there is no socket pooling by default.
",jcrugzz,jondubois
527,2014-09-30 16:56:19,"@seglo in `0.10.x` there was a `proxyError` event that was emit when something happened with the conenction so there could be a response sent to the client. This is now an `error` event. For example usage, see [here](https://github.com/jcrugzz/proxy-server/blob/master/index.js#L53-L65). The error event should not go unhandled, its the default behavior of the EventEmitter to throw when it has no listeners.
",jcrugzz,seglo
527,2014-09-30 18:56:20,"@jcrugzz I see, OK I'll start handling that.  Are you saying that with `0.10.x` a proxyError event would be raised, but is internally handled?
",seglo,jcrugzz
527,2014-09-30 19:25:50,"@seglo in `0.10.x` a `proxyError` event would be raised but it wouldn't crash the server if it wasn't handled. You just wouldn't properly respond to clients who disconnect if you didn't handle the event

527,2014-10-01 00:42:33,"@jondubois my explanation was how the `error` event in general should be handled. In node the semantics in various libraries are never consistent. Socket hangups don't only happen with that particular edge case you ran into. Do you have a gist of that consistent reproducible case? Im curious how its hitting the code paths in node core.

To me, both you and @WooDzu seem to not be handling errors when the destination you are proxying to kills the socket for whatever reason. I cannot really reason about this without a small reproducible code sample.

I general, the expectation should be to get these types of errors when there are legitimate network failures or the server you are proxying to goes down. Errors need to be handled in these cases. Please see my example [`proxy-server`](https://github.com/jcrugzz/proxy-server/blob/master/index.js#L53-L65) to see how errors are handled.

",pmalek,jcrugzz
510,2014-02-01 19:25:36,"@pmalek look at the [`httpProxy.createServer(options)`](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/blob/master/lib/http-proxy.js#L33-L55) function. It only takes an options argument and expects a full URL to proxy to. See the examples in the readme to see that a `target` is always a string to be parsed with the `url` module.
",jcrugzz,pmalek
510,2014-02-01 19:42:26,"@jcrugzz I have changed my options to look like this : 



and my `createServer` to 



( I have tried to remove the `ws`, `secure` and `xfwd` options) and now I do not get the aforementioned error but the page on `localhost:80` keeps loading as in an infinite loop ( I have my server listening on port `443` and I can see the http-proxy being created on port `80`)
",pmalek,jcrugzz
510,2014-02-01 20:01:33,"@pmalek Got it so there is a slight caveat here because of how the `ssl` options are used. See my response in #563. They are used as the server cert information in this case AND used as a client cert when trying to proxy. This is obviously not what you want as you are just running it as an `https` server that you want to proxy via http. This is not how it behaves. You may also want `secure` set to false as I'm assuming this is a self signed cert (but I'm not positive in how it behaves in regards to localhost so it may not throw an error).

Since I have not figured out a clean way to make this more clear without making `sslServer` and `sslClient` options. I would just create a standard `https` server and use `httpProxy` as just a proxy (so you dont call the listen function).
",jcrugzz,pmalek
510,2014-02-01 20:32:04,"@jcrugzz Can you provide a `gist` how should I use it as I do not really understand what would be there for me if I throw away `.listen(80);` from it ?

BTW: I already have an https server, that's what I need this proxy to redirect all of the clients to go from `localhost:80` to `localhost:443`.
",pmalek,jcrugzz
510,2014-02-01 21:24:25,"@pmalek ok lets back up a second, I misunderstood the use case. I thought you were proxying the other way around for whatever reason. What is the exact purpose of your proxy in this case? Until then I'll take a stab at what you MIGHT want.


",jcrugzz,pmalek
510,2014-02-01 21:53:48,"@jcrugzz My exact intentions are as follows: 

I have a working sails web server on port `443` using https. I would like to make a proxy (redirect clients coming on port `80`) to force usage of https at port `443`. 

So I thought using a `node-httpp-proxy` which would redirect all traffic from port `80` to `443` is a good idea. 

I have tried your solution and I have the following error : 



After that I have tried to change `secure: true` to `secure: false` and now it works but! on `http`. So I can access my server on both `http` (port `80`) and `https` (port `443`).

Yet still I would like to redirect clients to `https` while connecting to port `80`.

I have found this connected case https://github.com/mikeal/request/issues/418 and SO question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14088787/hostname-ip-doesnt-match-certificates-altname which suggest to use 



or 



while passing arguments to tls server but those didn't work for me (still the error).
",pmalek,jcrugzz
510,2014-02-01 22:09:06,"@pmalek the problem is what I outlined in #563 regarding self signed certs. Since you were supplying the ssl credentials I thought this wouldn't be an issue but I was wrong ;). You need an agent in order for `secure: false` to work (as it uses `rejectUnauthorized: false` under the hood).


",jcrugzz,pmalek
510,2014-02-01 22:19:41,"@jcrugzz I get this ""loop"" (no response/timeout) again on port `80`.

So let's summarize: 
- with `secure: false` I can access the website both on port `80` (using `http`) and `443` (using `https`),
- using `secure: true` I get `Error: DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT` on port `80` but can access website through `https` on port `443` without any problems
- with `agent: new Agent({ maxSockets: Infinity })` and no matter what `secure` is set to I get loop on port `80` and service ok on `443`
",pmalek,jcrugzz
510,2014-02-01 22:59:05,"@pmalek hmm ok, my mistake here is that this agent should be an `require('https').Agent` not an `http.Agent in this case. Give that a try but you should be at a point where this is debuggable.
",jcrugzz,pmalek
510,2014-02-02 00:29:34,"@jcrugzz This still gave me the same result (or `DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT`) and I have decided to use https://npmjs.org/package/express-force-ssl for this purpose but still I would like to  get that running (for different ports etc.)

Maybe some other time.
",pmalek,jcrugzz
510,2014-02-02 01:33:50,"@pmalek Ensure you still have `secure: false`. There is some odd behavior in this area which is why `0.12.x` will have a refactored `http`. Unless Im misunderstanding something about the behavior of HTTP -> HTTPS proxying, this should work. That module looks like your best bet for now.

regarding @RushPL 's comment i think he's referring to the performance that `ab` shows when tested against caronte.. there are a couple of things that make `ab` behave weirdly (most noticeably the fact that it's `HTTP1/0` and node allows only `HTTP1/1` requests, thus preventing me from sending a content length which `ab` requires).. using other `HTTP/1.1` perf suites hasn't shown, so far, significant penalties in using agents except the usual slow-down due to pooling

removing the field or just edit it removing sensible data.

If this is _really_ the cause then you probably want to fix your backend. What I would advice you to look into however is whether the handshake entirely makes it to the backend. If you see a tcp FIN or RST packet (an 'end' or 'error' event, in node terms) before the handshake is done, then that could be caused by a node-http-proxy bug.

In the example you linked, they are able to modify the response by monkey punching res.write inside the middleware. By using a similar technique with res.writeHead and/or res.setHeader (you'll have to do some research to figure out all the relevant methods) you should be able to make this work. That said, monkey-punching is kind of a hack and the proxy module was designed more for quick transparent proxying than it was for arbitrarily modifying the http request and response.

The reporter is complaining that pizza.com/taco/muffins is proxied to 127.0.0.1:8099/taco instead of to 127.0.0.1:8099/muffins/taco, which according to the documentation are both wrong behaviors, or at least thats my interpretation of what I read. But besides that I think that proxying just to  127.0.0.1:8099 should be the most common use case, i.e., you have several servers and you want to place them under different sub routes (to avoid for instance cross-browser scripting problems, etc). If we keep the subroutes in the proxied request, then we are creating a coupling between the proxy and the servers, both need to be always in sync, which I dont think is a good idea. Every server should be agnostic of where the proxy configurator has placed it...
Wouldnt it be better to support this kind of routes if we really want to keep subroutes:

Consider the scenario when the first backend fails midway through the response. It is impossible for the proxy to know at what point of the response the reverse proxy request errored.

My suggestion would be to pass a mock response object to `proxy.proxyRequest` which buffers the response into memory and when it ends then writes it back to the actualy `res`. This way you can discard the entirety of the data returned from the backend that failed and try all over again.

The example you posted shows how to connect to a target server/website that has multiple IPs/domains. So each request is routed to a different address of the target server.

I have a different need. I have a machine with multiple IPs attached to its network interface. I want to use a different IP for each request I do to a website. This will avoid the target server to track the users who make the requests.

I believe this is achievable by programming the net.Socket connection and would like to know if this project already support it in any way.

For the most part, you should be able to fix your code to achieve the functionality you want. Your code is just not structured correctly at all, see my previous comments.

1) run ""node test.js"" and open a browser on http://localhost:8000.
then show the console and you will see echo only from the direct
connection.

2) run ""node test-patched.js"" and you will be able to see echo from
both proxied and direct connections.

could be:
1) socket.io that you are using in your test.
2) the websocket library you refer under 'vendor'.

34,2011-04-22 02:43:29,"@indexzero - I think I'm running into a related issue here without websockets. 

I think the disconnect is in the fact that http-proxy acts as a proxy server by default. This means that the receiving server can tell the request has been proxied. In other words, it's not transparent. The proxy should act in this mode by default, but we should probably expose an API option to enable ""transparent"" proxying. I'm not sure if there is a better name for that.

1113,2016-12-19 21:51:35,"Hi!

I've found an issue allowing long running proxied connections to stay open. In this case, it's something we've seen related to the [webpack dev server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) which has this http-proxy package as its dependency via [http-proxy-middleware](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware).

In practise what we've seen is that long running proxied requests are being closed after 2 minutes, even though we specify a longer timeout with the **proxyTimeout** option. That in turn may make some browser automatically retry the request which failed, which is absolutely not wanted in some scenarios -- the latter isn't really this package's fault, so feel free to ignore that part.

After [digging for a while](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/369#issuecomment-266251977) I found the root cause to be in this package's request handler ([lib/http-proxy/index.js](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/blob/master/lib/http-proxy/index.js#L31)). By not setting a timeout on the incoming HTTP socket with [request.setTimeout()](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/http.html#http_message_settimeout_msecs_callback), Node.js core sets 2 minutes by default.

Ideally we'd like to be able to set **proxyTimeout** to whatever number we want and be sure that's respected. That possibly means using the same value in `request.setTimeout()`.

Does this sound okey to you? Any other thoughts?

This solution was suggested by @giuliopaci in https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/issues/867.  The problem with the header re-writing example in the README is that when you do a POST, the headers are sent before the 'proxyReq' event is fired.  So you really have to add the headers before calling request().  This patch allows the user to register a synchronous callback that gets called in setupOutgoing() in which the caller can setup headers, or alter the outgoing request() options in whatever way desired.

This is in regards to an issue I brought up in #915 yesterday.  I was having an issue with incorrect port selection and assumed @BadBoy20 might be having the issue too.  Anyhow, the problem for me was explicit declaration of the port was not taking precedence over the port implied by the protocol.  The unit test I created was failing before I made the fix.  Also, I did not check the getPort() function in common.js as it’s only purpose is setting “x-forwarded” headers in web-incoming.js and ws-incoming.js so it seemed out of scope for this issue.

919,2015-12-08 17:58:49,"@indexzero @aaronmaturen the reason I'm hesitant on this is due to the conversation I had with @indutny where `http2` based on his implementation in [`node-spdy`](https://github.com/indutny/node-spdy) only requires the proper `agent` to be passed in to enable proxying via `http2`. So this really has to do with what we want to support. 

Personally, I'm not a fan of of actually spinning up a server as part of `http-proxy` since that makes us biased on implementation in this case. But in terms of the actual bit that is proxying, I like @indutny's approach because it leverages the `agent` rather than requiring a separate `http` like library in order to make the request.
",jcrugzz,indutny
919,2015-12-09 06:16:18,"@indexzero ah, calling @dmai doesn't work on public git

Hm, I don't think it would be that bad if we supported the `http2` library since the docs for that library saids that `http2` has an api very similar to that of `https` and we support passing in options to `https`

I can see @jcrugzz 's point about not using a particular userland `http2` module though, and those who have read up on HTTP2 already would most likely know how to use our provided interface to spin up a `http2` web server w/o createProxyServer().listen() using the mentioned userland library or `spdy`
",donasaur,dmai
919,2016-03-25 23:00:54,"Hi Friends, 

@jcrugzz suggested that the node-spdy module by @indutny is a better way to spin up a new HTTP2 server. It made sense to me at the time, and it's fairly easy to get setup if you actually have an SSL cert to get past the browser security... 

Here is a small example for HTTP2 -> HTTP proxying without any changes to http-proxy.

If it fixes it, it looks the issue is under:

561,2014-01-23 18:39:23,"@glasser Well lets think of what we can do in these failure cases. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but in the case where the `socket` errors, we cannot re-proxy with that same socket. So it would make sense to have a different error function in that case that just returns the request if thats even useful? Cause it seems the connection is just FUBAR if we hit that case and we just need to kill the things and let someone know. So I'm thinking we may even want to destroy the socket when the socket errors as well if my assumption here is correct

thoughts @yawnt?

559,2014-01-22 21:49:02,"@jcrugzz @yawnt 

Here's my thought.  There are two ways we could go.  Either http-proxy should itself take care of this, by reacting to 'error' on `socket` by ending `proxySocket`... or http-proxy should give the end user access to `proxySocket` and let it do its own error handling.

I think the former is probably the way to go. First of all, it's more or less necessary to do this error handling, and we shouldn't make it easy for users to accidentally cause a leak.  Secondly, it's already the case that the ws `stream` phase doesn't give much control over the way that `socket` and `proxySocket` are connected (eg, it doesn't let you interpose some sort of transformation).  If we add an API for that later (or the user overrides the `stream` phase entirely) then sure, it would make sense to also give the user control over the error handling semantics. But because http-proxy doesn't offer that control, then it makes sense to do the automatic right thing.

Working on a PR now.  One thing that confuses me: it looks like there's a straight-up bug in the stream pass: it takes its server and head arguments in a different order from how they are passed in!  Is there a test suite that should be catching this?  (Our current production use of http-proxy/caronte is based on an old commit from back when caronte used EventEmitter2 which doesn't have this issue.)
",glasser,yawnt
554,2014-01-17 22:49:38,"@droppedonjapan the instance of `proxy` is does not require a callback when it is an `EventEmitter`, but you need to listen on the `error` event ;). It is only an `EventEmitter` in the following cases... see the code [here](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/blob/master/lib/http-proxy.js#L6-L54)



The `var proxy = HttpProxy.createProxy()` api requires the callback as it is the simpler implementation. 

Regardless the proxy has the chance of error so how you choose to handle that is up to you!

547,2014-01-11 12:43:43,"@yawnt found a few minor things when I was using this extensively:
- **EventEmitter3 will not throw on an unhandled `error`:** but without any default handler it's very confusing to debug when your proxy logic is just plain wrong. _We should have a default logger if there are no `error` handlers._ cc/ @3rd-Eden 
- **We should have a simple(r) `.createProxy()` method:** which is basically just exposing `createRightProxy`. A lot of our users don't even bother with `httpProxy.createServer`, they just use `new httpProxy.RoutingProxy()`. Forcing them to create a server that they will never use feels very awkward.

Using the proxy as a straight HTTP proxy works fine for most URLs but I find I'm getting 400 Bad Request from one particular server.

This pattern of using the proxy, a standard client proxy, isn't that easy to work out from the examples. I don't want to proxy an internal server, I want to proxy requests going to outbound servers, look at the requests and either log them or potentially change them on the way through. Though I'm not doing any of this in the test stub below.

Is there something I'm doing wrong with the proxy setup? It's strange that it works everywhere else except this one server.

## node: v0.8.25 | http-proxy: v0.10.3

I am using the [benchmark branch](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/compare/benchmark). The documentation on how to run these benchmarks is in [benchmark/README.md](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/tree/benchmark/benchmark). **On average I am seeing just under 3000 request / second.** 

**$ wrk -c 20 -r 2000 -t 4 http://127.0.0.1:8000**



**$ wrk -c 20 -r 10000 -t 4 http://127.0.0.1:8000**



The highest I pushed it was _100k total requests across 8 threads with a concurrency of 20 per thread:_

$ wrk -c 20 -r 100k -t 8 http://127.0.0.1:8000


## node: v0.10.19 | http-proxy: v1.0.0-dev

I am using the [1.0.0-dev branch](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/compare/caronte...1.0.0-dev). Again, the documentation on how to run these benchmarks is in [benchmark/README.md](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/tree/1.0.0-dev/benchmark). There are two main problems here:
#### 1. **A 50% performance degradation**

This could be a number of things (such as changes to node core itself), but right now I'm seeing _**a 50% performance hit.**_


#### 2. **Proxies fall over with ETIMEOUT**

Increasing the number of total requests beyond ~6k _without raising the concurrency or threads of the wrk process_ causes `node benchmark/scripts/proxy.js` to fall over with `ETIMEOUT`.

**$ wrk -c 20 -r 10000 -t 4 http://127.0.0.1:8000**

At the moment we always add the port, but I've encountered a website (10 mio pageviews a day) running IIS 7 that doesn't accept this host header and wants one without the port specified. See http://www.funda.nl. At the moment node-http-proxy doesn't work with this site if changeOrigin is enabled. Chrome f.e. doesn't add the port if doing a request for HTTP on port 80.

I saw only integration tests, no unit tests who cover this code, that's why there aren't any attached.

Doing things on a TCP level breaks many of the existing HTTP-level APIs which users rely on in connect and/or express, so this won't be an all or nothing change.

116,2011-09-22 14:49:45,"The problem is really with the optimism of the current pipe implementation:

https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/stream.js

There are no guards (i.e. `try/catch`) around calls to `.write()` (which can throw). Also the `source.readable` around `stream.resume()` are apparently not enough:
https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/stream.js#L127
https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/stream.js#L34-38

Recent commits have been added by @isaacs to fix problems regarding calls to those two methods throwing `uncaughtException` events:

https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/commit/7bda25b1c60d082f0f2fd12fc61b45a33b74f13d
https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/commit/558a8a4f79716496dbdee13759c8641606458c05

If we can solve these problems within the existing `.pipe()` implementation then it is probably fine, but I suspect it won't work because there are a couple of special cases for HTTP streams that we handle in `node-http-proxy`:

https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/blob/master/lib/node-http-proxy/http-proxy.js#L214-218

In short, I think `.pipe()` is awesome and when you have a little information around the HTTP stream you are trying to pipe, it works like a charm. As a generic silver bullet though, it still has a little way to go.

I would like to suggest a hotfix release for nodejs as `v0.4.7-1` or `v0.4.8` to resolve this inconsistency. If that's not a good plan I can always just revert node-http-proxy to the original code under v0.5.0 that works around this inconsistency.

Perhaps @ry or @mikeal could shed some light on why this is popping up again. Host is still being passed as a string in node-http-proxy (i.e. ""legacy"" arguments) https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy/blob/master/lib/node-http-proxy.js#L48

I think that this may be a bug in core related to `options instanceof String`. This syntax doesn't seem to be the correct way to identify the type of the argument. Here's a quick sample from the REPL:



Should be a quick fix. Reasonbly sure this has nothing to do with node-http-proxy.

34,2011-05-11 21:40:54,"So what's the issue? Most websocket implementations will be reading the headers of origin and host, as well as the various sec- ones. If you're proxying websockets and adding, say, a ""x-"" to the front of these headers, then the websocket implementations will break. I think it's probably best not to modify headers on websocket requests. 

As for the specification, I don't think it defines as to how proxies should interact with headers, @donnerjack13589 may know otherwise. I might also ask the guys I work with as to whether they can shed light, but they're in BST / GMT timezone.
",ThisIsMissEm,donnerjack13589
34,2011-05-11 21:44:25,"@miksago Thanks. The problem is that currently `node-http-proxy` rewrites the `origin` and `host` headers for WebSocket requests. This is causing some unexpected behavior for users over HTTPS and in other cross-domain proxying scenarios. 

Based on what you said, I guess we should just not be rewriting these headers at all?

That is, the fix was to manually set the header on the incoming request (i.e. the `IncomingRequest` was missing the `Host` header to begin with, and then`node-http-proxy` correctly proxied the request).
