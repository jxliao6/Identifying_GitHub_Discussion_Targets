Unfortunately, I don't think this is a good approach, as you only limit the number of parts in the multipart POST message, which doesn't have any perceivable benefit.
Users can still send an arbitrary number of files by sending multiple POST requests for example.
Without any user identification, it will not be possible to limit the number of files uploaded.

If you need to limit the number of files users can upload, you can already do this with the current version of the PHP library.
By making use of the options `user_dirs` and `max_number_of_files` you can effectively limit the number of files an individual user can upload.
",blueimp,saurabh-sharma
3462,2016-11-07 17:09:57,"Thanks for the reply @blueimp 

I am not talking about the max number of files that can be uploaded in a directory, but I did mean about enforcing 1 file limit per upload, which can't be trusted from the client side! User can just fiddle the script and just skip the single file upload limit.

I agree with you on this one:

> Users can still send an arbitrary number of files by sending multiple POST requests for example.

User can upload any no. of files (which can be restricted with the way you mentioned in above comment)

#3462 just adds an option for single file upload (I know it can be restricted from the front end using this process https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-to-limit-the-file-selection-so-users-can-only-select-one-file) to be restricted from backend as well.

And trust me, the front end option mentioned in the link above does not work with drag and drops at all.

And apart from all this, can you just enable the `issues` options for this repo? There's another serious vulnerability (And I want to emphasise on vulnerability) which needs attention.

I read your blog post and I think that's a very interesting approach to the problem.
I think a more fitting description would be ""server processing estimate"", as it's the processing on the server (or servers) that we don't get additional progress events on.

The server processing of images is the reason I usually display an animated progress bar, as this way the user still has an indication that something is going on.

I think your approach is interesting and valid as well, so I've added a link to your blog post to the [wiki](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki#customization-how-tos).

Unfortunately at the moment I will only merge new features that cannot be handled without this change.

Although your callback functionality would certainly be useful, this could also be handled with the current version.
You could e.g. override the `handle_file_upload` method in a subclass and call the original method in the subclass method. 

In my opinion, the file path shouldn't be a property of the file object, as it's not metadata related to the file itself, but only useful for operations on server-side.

Here is the scenario (code examples reduced for brevity):

I have a ""parent"" controller declared using ui-router like so



In my controller I have:



In my view I have the form similar to the demo:

The `$scope.queue` variable within the fileupload directive appears as empty when loading the page even thou the `$http.get` function actually sets it. I believe this is because it's not inherited form the parent controller.

**NOTE:** _notice that there is no controller declaration in the form tag; the controller is supposed to be declared for the whole view in the ui-router setup._



I saw the same behavior as @srigi where the parent scope is not being inherited

The way I fixed this is by implicitly telling the form which controller to use:



When I do this, the scope is inherited correctly

2607,2013-10-01 06:44:45,"@blueimp We plan to use jQuery-File-Upload via composer package manager not for server side implementation, but for client-side one. That's how we can keep your plugin as an external dependency and have an up-to-date version of the plugin.
Proposed PR does not require updating `composer.json` after each release. Composer will handle it automatically. All you need is to register at https://packagist.org/ and add a service hook to the Github.
Thanks in advance

Unfortunately, I won't merge your code for the following reasons:
- The code in your new if block is meaningless, as toUpperCase doesn't affect the value of the string itself, but returns the new value:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase
- method should not be used as name for an input field, as it collides with the method property of the form.
  If you really need to set it, you should define the type.
  Although it would help to check for a valid string here, I think this is unnecessary clutter, as it should only fail in rare edge cases and can easily be remedied by setting the type explicitly.

2585,2013-09-11 15:15:45,"The fact that I didn't assign the value to the variable is just a stupid oversight. :)
But thanks for kindly explaining it.

As for your decision to not fix the issue, may I carefully suggest you review it once more?
There is nothing in the spec that disallows such a name.
In fact, the [spec clearly states](http://developers.whatwg.org/association-of-controls-and-forms.html#attr-fe-name):

> Any non-empty value for name is allowed [..]

I find it quite likely that such a ubiqutous name as `method` might be used by other developers.
The error that is currently thrown is highly unusual and comes from inside of your upload library.
Do you think that preventing such a possible issue is not useful at all, @blueimp?

@blueimp, I feel like I'll break chunked uploads if I overload `get_file_name` because I can't clearly make out what `get_unique_filename` is doing. Have you got any advice on how to easily allow random filenames? Much appreciated

Yes, localization has been incorporated into the basic plugin, albeit with a slightly different approach as what @cibernox originally suggested in his pull request.
It's even possible to override the translation function to provide your own translation framework:

However, I don't think this is the best approach for this issue.

To limit parallel requests to the server, you can make use of the built-in option **limitConcurrentUploads** and set it to the desired number of parallel requests.

To make sure the uploads are done in order, you can set the built-in option **sequentialUploads** to _true_.

I'm aware of this bug in mobile Safari, however there is a server-side solution which doesn't require any client-side hacks:
Sending the following header (whcih is included in the provided server-side upload handlers) prevents this issue:

1919,2012-12-09 22:53:40,"Hi, thanks. We basically serve that header for all appropriate GET's but
never for POST ( since of course spec says POST must never be cached )
We have a mostly custom implementation/backend ( Perl based ) so I never
looked at the backend code.
Wish I had tough, this has cost me a lot of hours debugging. Will see if we
can set the header, it's a nicer hack :0)

However, it was already possible to delay the printing of the result content.
If you override the initialize method, you can call the public **get**, **post** and **delete** methods with _false_ as first parameter, to prevent printing the result (or sending any headers). Those methods return the unencoded result content.

You can then make use of the **generate_response** method to print the result and the headers:



With the latest commit (a706781bd6b4abd8c0be36c356c99169d76ba758) I've also wrapped the **header**, **echo** and **readfile** calls in object methods which allows extending classes to handle the response.

The $index variable you removed for the validation method might be used if someone wants to validate differently depending on the index of the uploaded file, although this is admittedly unlikely.

I'm trying to wrap your code in a symfony2 bundle without touching your
