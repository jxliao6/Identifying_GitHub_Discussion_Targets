164,2017-01-07 01:44:10,"@ryanolsonk I love the idea of extending the `FLEXHierarchyItem` to be a protocol, such that any framework can support hierarchy inspection. There is a caveat, however, where I've extended FLEX to jump between view and node hierarchies based on some heuristic rules for the entire picture to be visible in the explorer. If FLEX were to be opened up to support multiple frameworks, we'd have to figure out how to support custom traces of the hierarchy in a meaningful way â€” likely just push that responsibility down to the individual framework implementing support.

I haven't had much time to look at this since I've put it up, but happy to continue the dialog with you to figure out where to take this. In the meantime, we've started using my branch internally at Pinterest and it's working great. Excited to provide the support to others in the near future.

For peeking,
You need to move a bit of your mouse cursor to let it work while holding Shift + Command, **not** Command + Control + Shift.

For Popping,
While holding Shift + Command during peeking, press Control 3 times to pop out. I think 3 times means the hardest force applied, as the document stated, each key contributes 1/3 of maximum possible force.

105,2016-02-16 11:32:33,"Thanks a lot for the feedback @ryanolsonk and sorry for the late reply!

Yeah, I was originally hoping to do it like @nin9tyfour suggested. It would be very cool if the integration of Realm could be fully dynamic so that the functionality was available if Realm itself was detected at runtime.

I initially had a very quick play with it, but I couldn't get it to compile. I've never really played with weak linking a framework to that degree before, so I wasn't sure how much extra work it would actually entail.

I'm certainly happy to try and make it dynamic if you have any tips on how to go about doing it. I was wondering if it would have actually meant needing to import all of Realm's headers into the FLEX project.

Also, yep! I can provide a demo Realm file and class if you'd like some test data for the example app!

In any case, thanks for the feedback! I'll add those code changes and report back here. Time providing, I might also see about having another play with making Realm dynamic too!

100,2016-02-09 06:35:57,"Greetings everyone! Crazily enough, I actually had the same idea and came here to discover someone had already beaten me to suggesting it!

This was something I also wanted to see in FLEX (I use it quite a lot to debug one of my side project apps), so I took the time last weekend to add Realm integration and just pushed it as a PR: https://github.com/Flipboard/FLEX/pull/105

I was also very wary, as @nin9tyfour pointed out that requiring Realm as an explicitly-included dependency would be terrible. So the code is presented in an optional macro that is only included if the Realm framework is present in the project itself when FLEX is built.

In any case, let me know if you have any queries about it.

**Full Disclosure:** I am an employee of Realm (My main project is the Realm Browser), but as we are not presently in a position to offer official support for third party Realm integrations, I'm providing this as an unofficial project. I'm happy to assist with any queries in my spare time. :)

The `?` type encoding means ""unknown type"" (see https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCRuntimeGuide/Articles/ocrtTypeEncodings.html)

It looks like the the original type encoding in this case was `^?`, or pointer to unknown type. Have you seen this on any methods that exist in public headers? I'm guessing the parameter is some kind of block.

The original type encoding in this case is `@?` not `^?`.



`@?` -> `(? *)` wrong!

`@""UIView""` -> `(UIView *)` correct!

Yes, `(? *)` also found in public method like `transitionFromView:toView:duration:options:completion:`

nice to meet you. i learn squashing commits in FLEX this project too. if you use sourcetree, you can look this [post](https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/213902/in-sourcetree-how-do-i-squash-commits).

first, you need to squash all the commits in your local branch.
second, use `git push -f` to force write your remote branch, make it the same with the local one.

wish it help you, thank you.

soft remind, if you first try on this, remember to backup your branch. `git push -f` is strong but dangerous.

I want to spend some more time going over this before providing feedback. My initial impression is that the functionality is awesome, but it involves some added complexity. I'm hoping we can find some ways to simplify to make it easier to maintain.

I've been using the PonyDebugger approach but I'm not totally satisfied with it. My main problem is that it misses requests made using `+[NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest:...]` or the synchronous variant. I'm considering using an `NSURLProtocol` subclass which would get all requests (as @JaviSoto  suggested), but that comes with some drawbacks too. If we intercept requests with our own `NSURLProtocol`, the way we end up handling each request may be subtly different than it would've been otherwise.

I think I'll take a crack at the `NSURLProtocol` approach since the implementation should be pretty straightforward. I could see offering both options, though it would probably be better if one emerged as the superior approach. If anyone has other ideas on how to hook into the foundation networking stack, I'd love to hear them. I've been digging around in CFNetwork's private headers, but I haven't found a good place to quietly observe request activity. The system `NSURLProtocol` subclasses (e.g. `_NSURLHTTPProtocol`) do nearly all their work outside of Objective-C land where we can't easily swizzle to observe. Hooking the C/C++ functions is probably out of the question for this library.

Aside from that, here's my remaining task list for the feature:
- [x] Settings menu for the network history list
  - [x] Clear/trash button to dump recorded requests
  - [x] Enable switch for request recording.
  - [x] Slider for recorder cache size (value persisted in `NSUserDefaults`)
- [x] Sticky header in network history list to indicate when network capture is turned off and how many requests are in the list/accumulated download size. 
- [x] Test interaction with PonyDebugger
- [x] Form upload data in request detail view
- [x] Test in other apps

And some nice to have tasks:
- [ ] Sensitive field redacting
- [ ] Find a way to determine loads from NSURLCache and indicate that in the interface
- [ ] Copy/export option
- [ ] Donâ€™t block the main thread while prettifying responses to push into the response detail view (JSON, plist, etc.).
