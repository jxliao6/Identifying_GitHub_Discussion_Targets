164,2017-01-07 01:44:10,"@ryanolsonk I love the idea of extending the `FLEXHierarchyItem` to be a protocol, such that any framework can support hierarchy inspection. There is a caveat, however, where I've extended FLEX to jump between view and node hierarchies based on some heuristic rules for the entire picture to be visible in the explorer. If FLEX were to be opened up to support multiple frameworks, we'd have to figure out how to support custom traces of the hierarchy in a meaningful way — likely just push that responsibility down to the individual framework implementing support.

I haven't had much time to look at this since I've put it up, but happy to continue the dialog with you to figure out where to take this. In the meantime, we've started using my branch internally at Pinterest and it's working great. Excited to provide the support to others in the near future.

You need to move a bit of your mouse cursor to let it work while holding Shift + Command, **not** Command + Control + Shift.

For Popping,
While holding Shift + Command during peeking, press Control 3 times to pop out. I think 3 times means the hardest force applied, as the document stated, each key contributes 1/3 of maximum possible force.

111,2016-02-23 05:16:25,"Hi @khoren93! I'm the one who filed the PR for Realm support! Glad to hear you've started using it!

Oh dear! That was quick! While I tested the library on both a test Realm file, and a Realm file from one of my own apps, it sounds like it doesn't actually handle nullability properly. Sorry I missed that!

It'll take me a while to set up some test Realm data and test this myself, so if you have access to the FLEX codebase, could you please try this code out for me?

In the file `FLEX/GlobalStateExplorers/DatabaseBrowser/FLEXRealmDatabaseManager.m`, on line 104, can you please replace that with this?



That should check to see if there's actually a value provided by that Realm property, and if there's not, insert an `NSNull` instance in its place to ensure that a `nil` value isn't applied to the `NSArray` there.

Please let me know if that fixes it, and if it does, I'll file another PR. Thanks!

Yeah, I was originally hoping to do it like @nin9tyfour suggested. It would be very cool if the integration of Realm could be fully dynamic so that the functionality was available if Realm itself was detected at runtime.

I initially had a very quick play with it, but I couldn't get it to compile. I've never really played with weak linking a framework to that degree before, so I wasn't sure how much extra work it would actually entail.

I'm certainly happy to try and make it dynamic if you have any tips on how to go about doing it. I was wondering if it would have actually meant needing to import all of Realm's headers into the FLEX project.

Also, yep! I can provide a demo Realm file and class if you'd like some test data for the example app!

In any case, thanks for the feedback! I'll add those code changes and report back here. Time providing, I might also see about having another play with making Realm dynamic too!

This was something I also wanted to see in FLEX (I use it quite a lot to debug one of my side project apps), so I took the time last weekend to add Realm integration and just pushed it as a PR: https://github.com/Flipboard/FLEX/pull/105

I was also very wary, as @nin9tyfour pointed out that requiring Realm as an explicitly-included dependency would be terrible. So the code is presented in an optional macro that is only included if the Realm framework is present in the project itself when FLEX is built.

In any case, let me know if you have any queries about it.

**Full Disclosure:** I am an employee of Realm (My main project is the Realm Browser), but as we are not presently in a position to offer official support for third party Realm integrations, I'm providing this as an unofficial project. I'm happy to assist with any queries in my spare time. :)

The things I would want to look into are:
1. Is there a way we could use PINCache if it's available, but fall back to no persistence? This is similar to what we've done with Realm, and lets people opt-in to taking the dependency.
2. If we were to take PINCache on as a full dependency, how would current users of FLEX feel about that?

61,2015-05-23 21:48:42,"I've finally gotten to the bottom of this one. It turns out it's unrelated to AFNetworking .

The PayPal SDK is making it's own call to the `-connectionDidFinishLoading:` method. This was especially tricky to track down because it does it via a call to `performSelector:afterDelay:withObject:` in `-[PPSimpleURLConnection initWithRequest:connectionTimeout:]`. It seems to be passing nil in the object argument, too. I knew something wasn't right when I saw `__NSFireDelayedPerform` on the stack trace rather than what you'd expect from URL loading system.

It's unfortunate that the PayPal SDK calls the delegate method itself, but we can avoid the crash by no-oping if the connection argument is nil.

I've been using the PonyDebugger approach but I'm not totally satisfied with it. My main problem is that it misses requests made using `+[NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest:...]` or the synchronous variant. I'm considering using an `NSURLProtocol` subclass which would get all requests (as @JaviSoto  suggested), but that comes with some drawbacks too. If we intercept requests with our own `NSURLProtocol`, the way we end up handling each request may be subtly different than it would've been otherwise.

I think I'll take a crack at the `NSURLProtocol` approach since the implementation should be pretty straightforward. I could see offering both options, though it would probably be better if one emerged as the superior approach. If anyone has other ideas on how to hook into the foundation networking stack, I'd love to hear them. I've been digging around in CFNetwork's private headers, but I haven't found a good place to quietly observe request activity. The system `NSURLProtocol` subclasses (e.g. `_NSURLHTTPProtocol`) do nearly all their work outside of Objective-C land where we can't easily swizzle to observe. Hooking the C/C++ functions is probably out of the question for this library.

Aside from that, here's my remaining task list for the feature:
- [x] Settings menu for the network history list
  - [x] Clear/trash button to dump recorded requests
  - [x] Enable switch for request recording.
  - [x] Slider for recorder cache size (value persisted in `NSUserDefaults`)
- [x] Sticky header in network history list to indicate when network capture is turned off and how many requests are in the list/accumulated download size. 
- [x] Test interaction with PonyDebugger
- [x] Form upload data in request detail view
- [x] Test in other apps

And some nice to have tasks:
- [ ] Sensitive field redacting
- [ ] Find a way to determine loads from NSURLCache and indicate that in the interface
- [ ] Copy/export option
- [ ] Don’t block the main thread while prettifying responses to push into the response detail view (JSON, plist, etc.).

I'm not great at reverse engineering, but since `@selector(getReturnValue:)` is in `x1` before the `msgSend`, isn't it crashing in `-[NSInvocation getReturnValue:]`?

I'm not sure what caused it but I've submitted a PR that fixes it somehow.",NSExceptional,selector

Although this makes no effect in most situation. 
If some class implement `@selector(URLSession:dataTask:didBecomeDownloadTask:)` only, the method will not be swizzled.

119,2017-01-23 20:56:41,"Nice! I was discussing that API with @kastiglione recently. The one concern is that any allocations within the enumeration itself could lead to deadlock if they happen to be within the same zone. We should be able to avoid that by creating a side zone for memory used within the enumeration, but it will take a little more restructuring.

All that said, I'm open to trying the simple lock/unlock mechanism with the existing implementation. It may not be totally safe, but neither is what we have now.",ryanolsonk,kastiglione

I found some type encoding is `@?`. Than the method `readableTypeForEncoding` in `FLEXRuntimeUtility.m` convert this to `(? *)` like

FLEX is primarily intended to be a tool used in your own apps. I included the Springboard screenshots in the README to hint at what is possible, but I don't plan to add further instructions for that use case anywhere in the project. With a little searching, you should be able to find what you're looking for elsewhere. :wink:
