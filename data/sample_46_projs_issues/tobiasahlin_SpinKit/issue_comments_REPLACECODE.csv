Naive approach didn't work.",Vanuan,2017-02-17 06:41:13
131,2017-02-17 06:28:00,"what do you mean exactly?

you have every option html and css offers you. there is no ""native"" option given by SpinKit.
Here are two examples adding text below: https://jsfiddle.net/v02f6to7/
if you want the text also to be spinning or attached to the animation you first have to look at the animation css itself and decide if you add extra html / text in the spinner element itself or if pseudo elements are an option.

hope i could help you.

I have been wrestling with this for a while. Using a CSS diff tool and I can't find the difference between the sample code (using scss) and my project. Can anyone point me as to what might cause the sk-wave to squish like this?

I am using this in a ReactJS application. Interestingly, as soon as I put it in the react application jsx, I get this issue. Works fine when I have it in the app's container html. See below (html above, jsx below)

just define a background to the element the spinner depends on.
for example: 'rotating-plane' https://jsfiddle.net/y7yqusgr/
if you want to use the spinner as alpha mask, for example on the ""cubemove"" one, you could create svg masks and animate them with javascript.
there are some libs such as https://greensock.com/gsap to accomplish that.

I noticed PR https://github.com/tobiasahlin/SpinKit/pull/113 attempts to add the ability to configure the size of the loading symbol, however, it still hardcodes the values and produces a ton more CSS that most people will need.

There are some breaking changes that allow us to decrease code duplication:

- No margin is added to the spinner by default. The classes `sk-auto-hmargin` and `sk-md-vmargin` can be added to revert to the margins used before this PR.
- Renamed `sk-spinner-pulse` to `sk-pulse` to follow naming convention.
- Default to `display: inline-block` and `vertical-align: middle` for a more useful default

110,2016-02-18 11:36:01,"I don't know if that's the original meaning of the issue...

But indeed, when I look at the demo and see a nice animation, I would like to know which one to include.
For example, I see the fourth animation. First, I have to count the dots to have the number. It could be displayed somewhere. Second, I don't see the animation name. If I view the source, I see `sk-cubemove` inside it, but this name is nowhere to be found in the `scss/spinners` directory (looks like the demo is a bit out to date?).

So, in short, it would be nice to display ""4-wandering-cubes"" (in this example) somewhere on the page when selecting a demo.

I just stumbled upon a conflict using Animate CSS ‚Äúplugin"" (https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/), looks like they have keyframes called as well ""bounce"".
Maybe it would be better if spinKit keyframes have a specfic prefix like ""spinKitBounce"", it would avoid such conflicts as ""bounce"" is pretty common for CSS animation name...

You could easily do this with https://github.com/lazd/gulp-replace .

48,2014-07-07 13:50:38,"I love your style so I'm thinking of a little commission.

The three bounce is perfect for route transitions, but there are moments in certain views where a component is only fully constructed on demand. Suppose it takes a few seconds, up to six in my case, to build the component; I would like to overlay a spinner that conveys the work of ""unboxing"" (which the user prefers over ""construction"" in data entry apps).

The animation would begin with a plain square that unfolds from the centre into a diamond, which then unfolds from the centre into a square. If possible the shape would continuously shrink, and the shape would always be the same size, but if that's too difficult then the larger diamond could scale down before unfolding, and the larger square could scale down before the animation repeated. A simpler version of all this is to simply rotate the diamond back to the square and repeat, but I think the full version is more compelling.

This (or something like it) would make a nice addition to the SpinKit collection :D

36,2014-05-02 12:29:27,"First of all this spinner kit is awesome and I want to thank you very much.

This is a subset of spinners that I have combined into a single scss file which has been tested and is in full use at my company. This is intended as a starting file to work towards so that the css can be compiled down to a dist/spin-kit.css as the end goal.

Therefore, this is not meant to be a finished peace but is intended as a starting point as a discussion on how you want to proceed. I am fully open to adding a build framework to compile this scss down for you so it can be in separate encapsulated files like wave.scss, and three-bounce.scss. Personally I would favor npm/Grunt or Rails but it is up to you.

I'd love to help contribute.

36,2014-09-11 20:48:30,"@tobiasahlin if you look at my code you'll see that I've added:
1. Variables
2. Separated each spinner into it's own SCSS file. This enables you to easily include just the styles you want, without touching the source code at all.
3. Removed all browser prefixes and let autoprefixer take care of this to decrease the risk of typos (and potentially reduce the file size of the generated CSS as browsers start to drop prefixes)
4. The gulp tasks auto-generate the example HTML whenever the code changes

Sure we can go with this PR instead, but like it says it's a starting point whilst #50 is basically good to merge and put in production.

to push this project forward i added a buildsystem for it and rewrote everything to LESS. makin it way easier for developers to extend the library or include in parts of it its own projects.

to build everything to spinkit.css (and got a ruby with bundler installed ;-) ) you just need to:

Adds a traditional cog wheel spinner.  Generated from [this](https://gist.github.com/devongovett/5996869) Jade and Stylus which is a bit easier to read/more configurable due to Stylus's math, variable and looping abilities, and lack of prefixes. Happy to include that too if desired.

Is there a chance you can add a code for a simple SVG animation to show how more complex graphics can be treated?

Thanks.

Thanks for the contribution! Although technically very interesting, animating the border-width triggers a redraw every single frame (turn on paint rectangles in Chrome and you'll constantly see the red frame):

Which makes it not as smooth as the other spinners. All the current spinners are limited to animating the `opacity` as well as the `transform` properties. This spinner is also quite geometrically complex compared to other spinners‚ÄîI'd like to keep it simple, so I'll close this for now :sparkles:

15,2013-12-20 23:36:00,":warning:  This fixes a quite critical bug.

I've heard of spinners not animating for some in Chrome. They've been working fine for me, and it doesn't seem to be dependent on your setup/Chrome version. I haven't been able to figure out why this is happening, but I've figured out how to fix it.

The problem seems to be that Chrome supports `@keyframes` definitions without the `-webkit` prefix. Chrome doesn't, however, support `transform` without the `-webkit-` prefix. So even though `@-webkit-keyframes` is defined, `@keyframes` takes precedence, and nothing animates. This PR adds `-webkit-` to all transformations inside all `@keyframes` blocks.

(What makes no sense is that if this really is the case, it should never have worked in Chrome.)

Nice collection of loaders! Just a suggestion if you add:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

To your circles it will stop them jumping from there default value to scale(0) and starting the animation.

Thanks,

Fitz

I've created this code pen - http://codepen.io/fitz0019/pen/cEbGw to show the issue. 

I've increased the delay to make it more obvious. See how the circles go from default and jump to 0% keyframe styles? If you uncomment animation fill mode and refresh it should start with the styles applied from 0% keyframe.

If you want to use this for a project where you have users running IE9 and below, you'll want to check for unsupported browsers with JS and replace the spinner with a gif (or something similar.)
