I actually messed around with scale vs opacity, and personally preferred the blinking effect over shrinking because it gave me a loading vibe rather than just a pretty animation. Having said that, it's your project so you tell me what works with your vision best. I also changed the left/top/right/bottom movements to transform:translate as well.

This is true. All :sparkles: for this part. 

@paulrose @nmccready Let's make it happen.

@jmagnusson ~~In that PR :point_up:, I'm against deleting all the examples. Even though it's more code to maintain, I want to keep it easy to just copy paste, and previewing the animations. You mentioned that it's more complete than this PR though—is it anything you can help to fix here? Or give any pointers?~~ ←- Ignore all that, I was full of bullshit when I wrote it. Sorry :bow: 
",tobiasahlin,jmagnusson
36,2014-09-11 20:48:30,"@tobiasahlin if you look at my code you'll see that I've added:
1. Variables
2. Separated each spinner into it's own SCSS file. This enables you to easily include just the styles you want, without touching the source code at all.
3. Removed all browser prefixes and let autoprefixer take care of this to decrease the risk of typos (and potentially reduce the file size of the generated CSS as browsers start to drop prefixes)
4. The gulp tasks auto-generate the example HTML whenever the code changes

Sure we can go with this PR instead, but like it says it's a starting point whilst #50 is basically good to merge and put in production.
