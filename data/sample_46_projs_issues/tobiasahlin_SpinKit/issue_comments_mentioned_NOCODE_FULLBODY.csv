This is 1) Not an issue in Safari (only Chrome), 2) much less prominent outside of codepen for me, and 3) something I was unable to fix by changing the `display` property for the container, or by playing around with adding transforms (e.g. `transform: translateY(0)`) to any of the elements involved.

As far as I can tell, however, this is not an issue with SpinKit, but with how Chrome handles animations within tables, and how the spinner is being used. Closing for now.

15,2013-12-20 23:36:00,":warning:  This fixes a quite critical bug.

I've heard of spinners not animating for some in Chrome. They've been working fine for me, and it doesn't seem to be dependent on your setup/Chrome version. I haven't been able to figure out why this is happening, but I've figured out how to fix it.

The problem seems to be that Chrome supports `@keyframes` definitions without the `-webkit` prefix. Chrome doesn't, however, support `transform` without the `-webkit-` prefix. So even though `@-webkit-keyframes` is defined, `@keyframes` takes precedence, and nothing animates. This PR adds `-webkit-` to all transformations inside all `@keyframes` blocks.

(What makes no sense is that if this really is the case, it should never have worked in Chrome.)
