615,2016-12-12 18:35:00,"@ariddell Hmm... yes. My hunch is that the right long term move for personal mail, cardav, caldav, filesync, etc. etc. is to setup a docker ecosystem that revolves around an ldap/auth service, announces services (etcd, consul, docker service links, ...), and potentially utilizes a shared filesystem (local host filesystem volume, ceph, nfs, torus, glusterfs ... )

Each component would be responsible for it's own upgrade path, installation, etc. Could be run either on a single host, ala dokku, or across a kubernetes cluster.

576,2016-07-13 17:18:23,"@carljm - My thought here is that users changing passwords updates the database (if I use the roundcube plugin, which is what I'll be poking at next). If passwords are already in the database, then I just need to not clobber them. That's a _lot_ less work than having some external setup that grabs the password, encrypts it, puts it in Ansible, and then runs Ansible to update the database. Users also expect their password change to be instantaneous. Even if I update the database directly, then extract those passwords and update Ansible, it's clunky. Now my mailserver is updating my sovereign repository, and for most users, the Ansible configuration doesn't live on the mailserver. Git, SSH, push permissions...what I have here is far easier to manage.
",oskapt,carljm
576,2016-07-13 17:25:45,"@oskapt yeah, I get your thinking, and I've wrestled back and forth with this same question. But it still seems to me that there's some conceptual inconsistency in this PR. Right now, as you say, ""config is god,"" in every aspect. Whatever's in the config is guaranteed to match what's actually used (assuming you've run Ansible.)

After this PR, ""config is kinda-sorta-mostly-god, but only in terms of which records exist, not necessarily in terms of their data attributes -- various things could be changed directly in the database and will then not match your config, and that inconsistency could persist indefinitely."" I understand why that seems useful for passwords, but it definitely doesn't seem like an improvement in terms of simplicity or clarity of the mental model.

I wonder if there'd be some way to do this that applied _only_ to password hashes, and removed password hashes from the Ansible config entirely? I just really don't like the idea of having stuff in Ansible that is permanently out-of-sync and misleading.
",carljm,oskapt
576,2016-07-13 18:02:29,"@carljm It's a dilemma, for sure. I've run sovereign for ~2y at home, where my wife doesn't care if she can't change her password. I'm deploying it for a small office environment now, and they _do_ care. The workflow now with Fastmail is I set them up and give them their initial password and then tell them to change it. If they forget it, I can go back and reset it. I see this change for sovereign as the same logic. I set your initial password in the config and you change it. From that point on the password hash is ignored, as I believe _it should be_. I could add a `force: True` flag that would act as a password reset, so that the ""setting and resetting of passwords"" is still within the sysadmin domain, whether it's Ansible or some other tool.

In this configuration there is no other tool, so enabling Ansible to act like any other admin/management tool for passwords seems like the right move.

I don't know whose decision it is to merge or not merge these things - I'm just handing them over because they seem useful. I'm running them all in production, and they all solve specific problems I've encountered w/ sovereign.

FYI - I fixed the index issue with virtual aliases. I've only tested it on Postgres 9.1. If someone can test the IF/THEN for 9.4, that would be great. Otherwise w/ 9.5 it solves itself.

533,2016-04-05 18:16:19,"@neuhaus This PR doesn't change the fact that Apache is stopped before running the letsencrypt client, it just moves that logic directly into the `gencert` script instead of having it in Ansible.

The LE config that @mikeashley set up uses the `standalone` letsencrypt plugin, which runs its own webserver, thus it needs ports 80/443 available, thus we have to shut down our Apache first.

It might be worth considering whether we should instead use the `apache` or `webroot` plugin, and have our own Apache instance serve the LetsEncrypt confirmation stuff. Then we wouldn't need to bounce it. I'm guessing @mikeashley might have more insight as to why he didn't choose that route.

See http://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using.html#plugins for more on the available LE plugins.

I can (and will) add a comment into the `gencert` script clarifying the above.

This is indeed ""only a small part of addressing resuability"", as @mikeashley puts it. The title of the PR is perhaps too ambitious. I would love to do more.

I find that inter-dependencies like postgres are difficult to deal with in ansible. I haven't seen a satisfactory solution really (although some of @drybjed's tricks in https://github.com/debops/debops are interesting). My sense is you need some sort of key-value store to register what roles have been successfully run. I'm not sure sovereign's quite ready for that. It might be easier, in practice, to remove the inter-dependencies with role-specific databases.
",ariddell,mikeashley
526,2016-04-22 13:07:31,"@ariddell You are exactly right, some way to store a state in Ansible (which is inherently stateless by design) so that it can be carried over between the playbook executions, either in the same `ansible-playbook` run, or on subsequent runs, is needed to get full idempotency. In DebOps, I'm doing this using Ansible local facts stored on remote hosts (a JSON data structure with key/value data relevant to a particular role).

In the case of PostgreSQl support, which is done by the [debops.postgresql_server](http://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-postgresql_server/docs/getting-started.html) role on the server side, and [debops.postgresql](http://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-postgresql/docs/getting-started.html) role on the client side, I use Ansible local facts to pass the relevant data between two roles. The default variables are not good for this, because when a role is not included in the play, its variables are not ""loaded"" by Ansible. Other forms of variables available in Ansible are either not modifable through Ansible inventory, or the inventory itself which should be left under user control.

If you wonder why there are two PostgreSQL roles (and MariaDB, and similar), this allows an easy setup where the database server is on one host and clients that access the database are on another host(s).

As for remembering what roles have been executed before... I don't think that's really needed. You just need to ensure that each role is idempotent, and using the playbook, run your roles in the correct order. For example, my application roles don't really care if `nginx` role has been executed or not, they expect the webserver to just be there when it's needed.

@aridell I don't mind switching to nginx completely, but I'm not fond of using two different pieces of HTTP server software on one machine. It just wastes RAM (which is the most expensive resource on a rented server). It also doubles the attack surface. Apache is perfectly capable of serving this redirect (as is nginx, of course).

We can try to get rid of all `VirtualHost` instances on port 80 and use `mod_redirect` on the default instance listening on port 80 to do the redirects in a generic way and an `Alias` to serve the ACME files if you guys prefer that.

That said, I'm not the one who is implementing this feature so if you love this idea, don't mind my babbling.

426,2015-12-12 12:50:57,"Hey @ariddell :-) Ironically, Sovereign was one of the catalysts for making DebOps - I just wanted to do it better ;P

Current `debops.pki` available in the `master` branch was my first attempt at making any sort of Public Key Infrastructure, and it shows. It's like a house of cards, you change one thing and everything falls apart. I wrote it almost a year ago, and always planned to redo it after some time, when I found out what worked and what didn't. Now I'm ready to write it again, this time better and easier to control, and with more bells and whistles like ACME.

There is no ""DebOps ACME"" role, the ACME support will be incorporated into `debops.pki`. The reason is, not all hosts that can be managed by DebOps are expected to be reachable by the Let's Encrypt CA over the Internet, and I still want them to use TLS connections. So the support for different types of certificates will be kind of stackable - by default the internal certificates will be used, if ACME are present they will be preferred, and any external certificates provided by the user via a script will take precedence (think their own company PKI infrastructure).

Don't think of the set of certificates signed by Let's Encrypt as only for the webserver, it's a mistake. X.509 certificates are agnostic. You just need to make sure that you provide them in a standardized location and configure your various services to use them. Coincidentally, that's what `debops.pki` aims to do, to make a stable and known environment for other roles to use certificates. For example path to where certificates are stored is saved as an Ansible local fact, which other Ansible roles can use to configure certificate support in their services. That way, I don't need to worry about `nginx` role maintaining its own set, it just hooks up to `debops.pki` infrastructure if it's present, automatically.

As for using Sovereign with DebOps roles... One issue might be heavy use of role dependencies in roles like `debops.nginx` or similar. I'm currently in the middle of refactoring things to move ""hard"" role dependencies into [the corresponding playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/tree/master/playbooks/service) of each role - after that you could use them in Sovereign without much issue, apart from handling missing firewall support, for example. But it will take some time, other things like ACME took precedence. You can right now disable `debops.nginx` role dependencies by setting `nginx_dependencies: False` in the Ansible inventory, that way they will be just skipped.

If there is an active man-in-the-middle attack (such as stripping STARTTLS), the clients must be configured to enforce STARTTLS, otherwise the attacker can talk plain text to the client and use STARTTLS while talking to the server.

This time ran into another issue with the mail server telling me that the database backend could not be reached. Because of this randomness I switched to Ubuntu. Here everything seems to be working nice besides encfs. Before this project I was running mailinabox which also had problems. It was because of the advanced partition layout my hoster delivers after a clean install. Perhaps the same applies here? That is my partition layout:

- none 4.0K 0 4.0K 0% /sys/fs/cgroup

One big thing, you authenticate with ""user@domain.com"" to IMAP but you use ""user"" for Owncloud over CalDAV/CardDAV. PHP-Push-2 only can receive one set of credentials.

As @lukecyca says I've been investigating how to 'Dockerise' Sovereign. This is currently a work in progress (see #99). The plan is to host Docker images for components of Sovereign on a Docker registry. These will be updated when application updates are available and can then be pulled by each Sovereign server. Ansible will still be an important part of this process but the roles will  be much simpler as most of the configuration will then be in Docker containers.

It would be possible to put the relevant roles on Galaxy but I'm not sure if these would be that useful to other Galaxy users?

With regard to making it easy for Sovereign users to choose which applications to install, I'm currently of the opinion that commenting out roles is a reasonable approach given the target demographic of Sovereign. I can't see how Galaxy would make this any easier or more elegant. (But I might be missing something!)

Any thoughts / suggestions gratefully received.

I'm inclined to agree with @adrinux. For better or worse, the components of Sovereign are fairly coupled.

Did you run it all at once? Or did you by chance do it in batches (interrupting and restarting it)?

I ask because the [task that copies the import.sql into place](https://github.com/al3x/sovereign/blob/master/roles/mailserver/tasks/postfix.yml#L20) notifies a handler to run the import. If you interrupt the playbook before that handler runs, it won’t import. Worse, the task won’t notify the handler on subsequent runs of the playbook because the import.sql file already be there.

You could test this by deleting `/etc/postfix/import.sql` on your server, and re-running the playbook. You should see it copy the file over again _and_ import it a little later in the playbook.

Assuming that’s the case, we could improve this by forcing the handler to run right after the copy.

If you run `ufw disable` and `ufw --force enable`, you should see the error. (If you don't, then I'm seriously mistaken in my assessment!)

Another workaround for us is to disable ufw logging by issuing a task to run `ufw logging off`. Logging is broken either way, but at least then it would start cleanly.

31,2013-09-22 04:28:51,"The `*_CAfile` parameters are not quite right after this change. I've studied the postfix docs some more ([this page](http://www.postfix.org/TLS_README.html) is especially detailed) and here are the relevant parts:

### [smtp_tls_CAfile](http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_CAfile)

> A file containing CA certificates of root CAs trusted to sign either remote SMTP server certificates or intermediate CA certificates.

In other words, this is the set of all the CAs in the world from which our server will recognize certificates. When our server tries to send email to gmail.com, gmail's smtpd will present a cert signed by GeoTrust. Unless we have GeoTrust in our list of recognized CAs, we won't be able to validate gmail's cert.
This should be set to `smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

### [smtpd_tls_CAfile](http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_CAfile)

> A file containing (PEM format) CA certificates of root CAs trusted to sign either remote SMTP client certificates or intermediate CA certificates.

This is similar to above, but since it's for `smtpd`, it is used to validate client certs from clients connecting to our smtpd server.

> By default (see smtpd_tls_ask_ccert), client certificates are not requested, and smtpd_tls_CAfile should remain empty.

Since we are not using client certs in this configuration, we have no use for this line.

### [smtpd_tls_cert_file](http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_CAfile)

This is correct after @bcachet's fix, however...

> To enable a remote SMTP client to verify the Postfix SMTP server certificate, the issuing CA certificates must be made available to the client. You should include the required certificates in the server certificate file, the server certificate first, then the issuing CA(s) (bottom-up order).

So this should actually be our cert, followed by the rest of the cert chain. Otherwise, you'll notice you get `Verify return code: 21 (unable to verify the first certificate)` when you test with `openssl s_client -connect mail.example.com:465`.

I have (erroneously) made my `/etc/ssl/certs/wildcard_ca.pem` be the whole chain (since there was multiple TODO placeholders in there), which is why this was working for me.

I'll submit another pull request to clear these things up, and try to make the docs more explicit to prevent people from making the same mistake I did.

The LE config that @mikeashley set up uses the `standalone` letsencrypt plugin, which runs its own webserver, thus it needs ports 80/443 available, thus we have to shut down our Apache first.

It might be worth considering whether we should instead use the `apache` or `webroot` plugin, and have our own Apache instance serve the LetsEncrypt confirmation stuff. Then we wouldn't need to bounce it. I'm guessing @mikeashley might have more insight as to why he didn't choose that route.

The firewall _is_ running and operating properly, but the `enable` command fails to mark itself as enabled in `/etc/ufw/ufw.conf`, so it fails to start at boot (which I think is a problem).

Upon further investigation, it seems there is a [bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ufw/+bug/1065297) whereby ufw logging is incompatible with our version of iptables. A fix has been committed, but it's not fixed in the version we're using (0.31.1-2). 

If we turn logging off, this bug goes away and the `enable` command works fully, but I'm not sure that's a good solution.
