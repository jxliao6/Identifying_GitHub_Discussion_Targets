- The first problem originated because my readme file is README.md a markdown file. That dependency is not installed with pip.
- Second problem is that source files are parsed by the syntax highlighter. That script in cgit enforces the use of python3 but the pygments dependency is installed with the system pip which in debian jessy is still python2, thus pygments was not available for use in the python3 interpreter. I have added a Python3 pip and install pip3 dependencies for it

I was also thinking it might be good to update cgit version to current 1.1. That version even enforces python3 in the markdown converter. That would allow to remove the pip2 install dependency that I for the moment have left in the role. Also I don't know how to force the install step once the version has been updated.",Titan-C,

If you have a large team that constantly and in a VERY fast pace tracks
security issues, maintaines, updates and rebuilds your local docker
packages,
this approach of using Docker might be fine.

Otherwise I'd consider it a security nightmare with a jungle of not
properly maintained docker images.

Build it straight from the Debian packages so that a simple ""apt-get
update; apt-get upgrade"" gives you the latest security fixes.

667,2017-03-21 17:16:42,"> My biggest issue with sovereign is that it is not modular enough

This was what prevented me from using sovereign, since it has many interdependent parts (and also because it had many services I don't need, and I wanted to learn ansible/ configuration management in general).

I'm still following development here as I consider it high quality work and the commit log is very instructive; feel free to borrow ideas from my (personal, wouldn't yet recommend for production use) ansible based self-hosting solution at https://github.com/nodiscc/srv01 - it is not as feature complete as sovereign but I think it solves the modularity problem (roles are sometimes interconnected but it takes advantage of ansible's tagging system). Criticism and bug reports are also welcome.

I'm not very interested in Docker based containerization but I'd like to learn/work on seccomp/LXC/... based sandboxing in the future.

Best of luck with future work on sovereign",nodiscc,

handsOn was created for german users, the description is in german: http://return42.github.io/handsOn

But I guess, with a little bash knowledge, reading the scripts https://github.com/return42/handsOn/tree/master/scripts and with a look at the templates https://github.com/return42/handsOn/tree/master/templates everyone will see how my setups are made.",return42,
667,2017-03-22 19:00:27,"@return42 with all respect I would not use your project _at all_; and I don't think it can actually be used to improve sovereign. Sovereign's only indesirable characteristic is interdependence of roles. Regarding handsOn

 * `cloc` reports 4000+ lines of Shell scripts...  ಠ_ಠ
 * Improper quoting, improper use of comparison operators, `shellcheck scripts/*` reports hundreds of errors/warnings...
 * No idempotence at all
 * (Apparently?) tight coupling between components
 * No configuration hardening
 * No english documentation

This is just a list of few things you could improve (hint: you might be better off starting from scratch and using configuration management).

Re. sovereign 2: I would definitely use something based on/similar to [DebOps ansible playbooks](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks), which can *actually* be run separately, but with an added layer that eases configuration/customization (which Sovereign is actually good at, and was a great inspiration for my work - single config file).

667,2017-03-23 13:09:58,"@return42 I understand; juste a note that if you use it for educational purposes - aside from a few ansible-specific tricks and basic config - I think ansible makes the whole setup much easier to understand than bash scripts - ie. you don't have to learn bash intricacies; along several other advantages. Not trying to detract from your work, it looks rather well done aside unavoidable problems when working with a large bash codebase, which ansible effectively abstracts away.

@alexec I have re-read your writeup and I think it brings some good points, can you give some details on the following:

* Requires a too much experience in Linux system administration to set-up and maintain. E.g. You need to know DKIM, DMARC, Postgresql, MySQL, Apache etc etc: How so? 
* Requires too much time to set-up: Been a while since I tried it. How much time does it take? What is the longest step and can it be automated?
* Requires too much time to maintain: Same question, what are required maintenance tasks? I've come up with a soltuion that only requires running an `upgrade` command periodically. How can this be automated?
* Does not work on Ubuntu (package version problems): WHile I understand it is tempting to support every distribution, I think focusing on a single (or 2) distributions is part of the project's value (I chose Debian stable)
* Needs manual configuration (OwnCloud is insecure by default): How so? Can you link to that particular proble/can it be automated?
* Configuration is not consistent: How can it be solved? The way I solved this is a single configuration file.
* Hard to choose what components to install: Yes. Roles probably need to be split up and reorganized
* Components are not isolated: Further sandboxing/isolating services through seccomp/LXC/SELinux could be done without requiring downloading a full docker container each time.

oskapt has build a role to install it with his sovereign branch.

Debian testing has a package for it that is pretty current.
The package in Debian stable is very very outdated.

`ls` is being used to check if /encrypted/ is empty. If it is, then `ls /encrypted/*` gives the exit status 1, otherwise it exits 0. A side effect of this is that ansible complains...",sigmafeud,2017-01-17 15:01:04

But this only works if you have a completely static setup and you plan
to never ever to add or remove users after your initial installation.

I have changed the passwords with this method, and added new email
accounts which I did not have in mind in the beginning. But other than
that, yes is a static setup. I'm the single user, of all the few
accounts I configured. I have not yet thought about removing users, it
is not yet in my use case.

640,2017-01-15 21:39:04,"> how to add accounts, domains etc

The canonical way to add email domains/users is adjusting the variables in `group_vars/sovereign` and then re-running the playbook. You of course also have to follow the DNS instructions (in the README) for each domain to ensure MX, SPF and DKIM are set up.

Adding domains for other purposes requires some manual steps is just beyond the ""normal"" use case of Sovereign. For a website you would need to create a new Apache virtual host at the very least, and also maybe manually create a certificate through LetsEncrypt. Adding additional domains for other services (OwnCloud, etc.) is, uhh, you're on your own. :)

>But this only works if you have a completely static setup and you plan

This should not be the case. If you change the `mail_virtual_users` and related variables, it will correctly reflect those changes the next time you run the playbook. [import.sql](https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign/blob/master/roles/mailserver/templates/mailserver.sql.j2) will be re-templated with the new user information, and the `import sql postfix` handler will be triggered to run it on the server. That `sql` script first deletes the relevant tables and immediately re-creates them.

Deleting users will remove them from these database tables (and thus deactivate them) but it will not actually delete the mailboxes from disk.

And thus you will also reset/delete all the passwords (amongst other
things) that your users might have changed in the meantime. Not good.

What I did:
- Hashed password with the python passlib code, copied from the tutorial, only replacing 'password' obviously.
- Copied it over to the group_vars/sovereign file, without putting it into double quotes, leaving a space before it, like this; password_hash: hashed_pass  

Questions:
- Do I insert the hashed pass with quotes in the config, or without?
- Do I login with user@domain or simply user? 
- Is it possible to create an user account after installation, without logging in to the admin account first?

For the third, successful install I turned off my VPN and started with a fresh VPS again, no double quotes around the hash, and it worked.

621,2016-11-25 11:59:27,"There are several ways to backup MySQL databases and it's always a compromise between availability and complexity since there is no integrated support for hot backups like PostgreSQL has. I'd figure these solutions to be somewhat feasible for sovereign:

* `mysqldump` and `FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK` -- Cold backup wich blocks write access during dump . For smaller databases this is probably negligible, especially if backups are run at times with low demand. This gets bad where availablity is a concern and/or databases are quite large (and dumps take quite some time rendering the server immutable).
* Percona's `xtrabackup` -- Hot backup without hassle, but works only with `InnoDB` engine. This is a simple solution with minor restrictions, but InnoDB is superior to MyISAM in many aspects anyway.
* `mysqldump` with master-slave replication -- Hot backup, with slave replication stopped for dump. While setup is actually not quite complicated it still adds additional complexity and requires more resources for the additional slave server, thus getting out of the scope of sovereign.

I'd prefer to use `xtrabackup` if it's possible to go without MyISAM databases.

615,2016-11-04 22:16:45,"A simple role to install the [Baïkal](http://baikal-server.com) CalDAV (calendars) and CardDAV (contacts) server via Sovereign.

The server runs on `dav.example.com` and the connection is encrypted  thanks to the Let's Encrypt support Sovereign already provides.

### Why

I don't need a full fledged ownCloud installation. I've heard good things about it but I simply don't need file sharing, a web UI for my calendars, sharing, photo galleries, etc. You might, and that's fine, but for me it only adds complexity (and possibly, maybe, a larger attack surface). I only need a something that syncs my contacts and calendars between my phone and laptop. That's all.

### Alternatives

There are a few other CardDAV and CalDAV solutions out there. I personally tried [Radicale](http://radicale.org/) and Baïkal but there are [plenty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_CalDAV_and_CardDAV_implementations) of other options out there. There is even a Radicale Sovereign role, currently being discussed in pull request #462.

Why not go for Radicale? I tried. I tried again this week but ran an older version a while back and it doesn't fit my bill. I like it, it's closer to the unix philosophy as Baïkal but development doesn't feel as active and there have been issues when using macOS software (Contacts and Calendar). Not saying it's a bad solution, it just didn't work for me.

### Open issues

- [ ] Depends on MySQL

This role currently depends on MySQL and it's my understanding Sovereign is moving to PostgreSQL. Baïkal only supports MySQL and SQLite. What should I do: keep MySQL or do I use SQLite?

- [ ] Tests

There are currently no tests for this role. I did not yet take the time to learn how to test an Ansible role and will add tests if the there is intertest in a Baïkal role.

- [ ] How do we include options?

I currently added the Baïkal role to the `site.yml` config. This is not a good idea as you probably don't want to run ownCloud _and_ Baïkal. How do we show there is an alternative without adding it to the `site.yml` config? Add it as a comment at the end or is there a better way?

- [ ] GUI configuration

Once installed Baïkal needs to be configured via a web UI. Once done the web UI can be disabled but you need it the first time. This bothers me as it means the role is not fully automated: you need to configure it manually, a config file would have been better. Is this simply a matter of explaining the process in the README or can we do better?

- [ ] No backups

I don't think we update MySQL databases at the moment (might be mistaken) which means your data is not backed up when using this role. Will add this when I add PostgreSQL support.

### Feedback

Feedback welcome: is this something Sovereign can use or should we just focus on the ownCloud integration and not spend time supporting alternative options?

Each component would be responsible for it's own upgrade path, installation, etc. Could be run either on a single host, ala dokku, or across a kubernetes cluster.

It turned out that importing sql happens as a result of ""Copy import.sql"" task, which in turn notifies import task. Problem is - if you stop deployment in the middle of the process but after import.sql is copied and before import task is run, next re-run of deployment will completely ignore importing, since nothing did change during copy task...

So I was wondering if that something ansible playbook should take care of (may be run import sql always, not only when import.sql file changes) or may be there is a flag somewhere to trigger notify to always run? 

I personally resolved it by SSHing into server and manually deleting /etc/postfix/import.sql

I'm in the process of making my VPS usable using the partial sovereign deployment, and it seems that `.dovecot.sieve` was in maildir, directly, which is why my `mail.err` exploded :)

[This mail thread](http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot/2009-October/043586.html) has some more details about that, but basically what I did is I modified `/etc/dovecot/conf.d/90-sieve.conf` from:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

to

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I re-created the `ln -s` and removed `~/.dovecot.sieve`. By the way, dovecot runs as `vmail`, so chgrping the folder to `dovecot` doesn't make much sense, unless I'm missing something.

All this could be a side-effect of the partial deployment, as well as something that could be handled better.

On my box `.dovecot.sieve` is a symbolic link pointing to `sieve/phpscript.sieve`.

The way I avoided the issue on my system was to move the mail into a Maildir subdirectory.
so in  `sovereign/roles/mailserver/files/etc_dovecot_conf.d_10-mail.conf`
change line 30 from
`mail_location = maildir:/decrypted/%d/%n`

`mail_location = maildir:/decrypted/%d/%n/Maildir`

I'm about to give up. This has been an exercise in futility overall.

I tried both master and wheezy on 14.04, 15.04, 16.04, useless. No way in hell you can get it to work, there's just too many things that are different, packages that are discontinued, owncloud has issues with requirements not updating, there's a test repo to address that instead of actually updating the official repo, whatever. No matter how many times I tried to run ansible-playbook it kept failing in new ways, which utterly defeats the purpose of automating commands.

Then I figured since master is about 200 commits ahead of wheezy it shouldn't be as neglected. Still no luck there. I have a fresh Debian 8.6, I ran ansible using master branch, and at the end of it all (which by some miracle was able to complete) I've got a borked setup. Nothing accepts any of the passwords, except for znc :)
- there was no sqlite3 installed, roudcube never created its database file in /decrypted. If you inject the sqlite.initial it won't work. Trying to log in says Invalid request! No data was saved, nothing is logged about the error anywhere.

2. read., the wallabag installation: database has tables created but everything is blank
3. owncloud installation is serving autoconfig. (I see the mail folder with config-v1.1.xml). `/var/www/owncloud/config/config.php` is blank. And again, nothing in the vhost config suggests it should be serving `/var/www/autoconfig`. This is odd.
4. selfoss installation does not accept any logins. It's unclear whether it's trying to get to a non existing sqlite.db file in the webdir under data/sql/something.db or it's failing to pull anything from the local mysql install, which by the way does not have a database named ""selfoss"", and it's using the root user to access mysql which in my opinion should not have a blank password in the first place.

Why do you use sqlite3 when there is already an installed postgresql?

I am planning to add postfixadmin to the mix, which will also use
postgresql as its backend and to change the current postfix setup
accordingly
Keeping all data in one database server instead of distributing it
amongst postgresql, the mysql family and sqllite gives you the advantages
mentioned above plus it is easier for those pieces of software to
interact with each other.

Somewhere on the net there is a postfixadmin/roundcube integration
plugin floating around  which will then allow end users to change their
passwords from the roundcube gui for example.

Keeping you data in several seperate and different database backends
will turn this into a mess.

And how many applications do you know support accessing more then one
database engine at one? It is always either or.
How are you doing to keep the account information for dovecot, and
roundcube and... in sync when they are all kept in different DB engines?
Either you are building yourself a single user mail server and you don't
care or you'll get into into support hell real quick.
And then you'll find out that maintaining accounts and passwords accross
multiple applications AND database engines is no fun.
It is much easier if you have to access one, to code for one instead of
two, three or more that you access in parallel.
How many persistence layers do you know support different engines in
parallel? You always configure them either or.

582,2016-08-10 13:26:42,"As an extension to the behavior documented in #581, there is a race condition regarding mail delivery when the playbooks are run. 

During the time that the SQL is being run, any mail that is delivered or being processed will suddenly find itself with no user configuration on which to operate. The period in question is small, but it exists.

The problem arises from our behavior of dropping the tables and recreating them from scratch.

My proposal is that we don't do this. If we were running mailservers without using Ansible, we would have a utility for managing users and domains, executing add/move/change as necessary. No Exchange admin blows away the database and reloads all configuration from a CSV file when he wants to add a new user. Even those using flat file maps make changes and recompile the hashed versions. The mere fact that we are using Ansible does not mean we suddenly have license to be sloppy. If anything, we should be _more_ elegant, because our CLI-fu gives us more flexibility.

Dropping the tables on every run is the easy way out, but it's not the right way to do it. Dynamic SQL templates, though more complicated, deliver precision actions according to the rules we define.

My solutions proposed in #581 will solve this issue because Ansible will only act on objects that need to change. If we decide not to implement the `password` plugin in Roundcube, then we can assume that the user has never changed his password. If that assumption is true (and without providing a means for them to do so, it is true), then we only have to make add/move/changes to the database records for users and domains that require them. Our exposure is then no more than it is in an enterprise environment when the admin clicks the OK button in the GUI.

To do so is wrong. It's lazy. It's forgivable only in the context of trying to get to our objective as quickly as possible, but if a problem comes up as a result of this decision, we are tasked with reworking the solution to fix the problem. 

If you only care about a mailserver serving mail for yourself, then you are justified in not caring. However, this does not preclude considering a better solution. Sovereign's mailserver and webmail component _already_ build and configure a complicated group of applications, so rather than reinvent the wheel, people _will_ use this for small groups. You can continue to tolerate its shortcomings under the pretense of ""it was never meant to be used by more than one person,"" but Postfix, Dovecot, Roundcube, et al, _were_ meant to be used by more than one person. 

I'm offering a solution that keeps the workflow clean and professional. You can decline to accept it, but do it for a reason better than, ""why would you not just simply take the lazy, easy, amateur way out?""

581,2016-08-10 13:11:23,"The way that the playbook is designed appears to target a single-user environment. All passwords are generated manually offline, most are hashed, and the hashed form is put into the config. These hashed forms are inserted into files and tables as appropriate.

At the same time, the mail portion of the configuration allows (and encourages) multiple users. Sovereign, as built, is an excellent setup for a private mail server. The problem is that users cannot change their passwords.

As it is currently written, with all passwords are stored in the Ansible configuration, all Postfix tables are dropped and recreated on every Ansible run. This means that even if a user _could_ change their password, it would be reset on the next run. If that structure changes, there is still no provision for a user to change their password. The would have to come to the person who runs Ansible, tell them the new password, and that person would have to generate the new hash and re-run Ansible.

This is contrary to our responsibilities as system administrators. We should _not_ have everyone's password. Users should trust that the system we run is secure. We should encourage people to change their passwords on first login so that we have plausible deniability regarding access to anyone's account, whether they be friend, family, or coworker.

My proposition is as follows:
1. Configure the SQL in a way that does not drop and recreate the tables. We can do this by using `IF NOT EXISTS` statements, conditionals around index creation, and dynamic SQL around creating and removing users based on whether they exist already and what we are telling Ansible the state of the user should be (`enabled: yes` or something similar).
2. Add a flag of `force: yes` to the user configuration in Ansible that tells it to overwrite the current password with the provided hash. This can be used for password resets and locking accounts that we want to keep around. Those people who wish to continue using Sovereign in its current form can provide `force: yes` to all account definitions.
3. Add additional configuration to Roundcube to enable the `password` plugin and provide the appropriate SQL statements for it to work with Postgres.

As for keeping thing on the client side, such as passwords, and in a repo, Ansible Vault is designed to allow you to do this safely. 

Furthermore, if the use case _can_ spread to > 1 user (even if that is just me and my wife), why not give users the ability to change passwords? Does including this functionality, already nicely packaged for you, cause damage?

I compensated by not activating it - it's just code sitting there, waiting for the user to find it (or for my other PR to be merged).

I'm putting it all in `/var/lib/roundcubemail-{{ roundcube_version }}` with a link to that at `/var/lib/roundcube`. All config files have been updated/modified to use this path. My `no_roundcube.yml` from #574 removes these locations, and all configuration, whether it was installed by package or from source.

We have some basic choices:
- use 0.9.5 (not an option on jessie)
- use nothing 
- install it from source
- wait for someone upstream to fix whatever the problem is

Given these options, let's consider our objective. If we want to be package maintainers for Debian or Roundcube, then we're in the wrong place. If we want to be proud that our collection of tools for running a private mailserver does _not_ provide a web mail client, then maybe we're doing alright. If we want to wait for Debian to change their mind about including it, or for someone else to write another web mail client that Debian _will_ include, then we should all go get beers.

If, however, we want to give a complete tool set for privatization of mail in the post-Snowden world where we all live, we can consider the shortest path to the objective of giving our users a functional, robust, web mail client and install it from source.

576,2016-07-13 16:21:18,"Sovereign, as written, drops all tables and recreates them on every run. In doing so it recreates all users with passwords as originally set. There is no provision to allow users to change their own passwords (though I'm about to work on that), and if they did, the passwords would be clobbered on the next run. This also creates a race condition - email that arrives during the instant that the database is down will be dropped or misrouted.

This PR changes that. It adds some additional plays to determine what users and domains exist and modifies the template to not add those that do. It also adds an option for `active: False` for each object (domain, user, alias), which will remove it from the database if it exists. Domains are sent through two tests - they must be in a list of domains that exist in the database, and they must not have been deleted during this run. Users and aliases are only added for domains that pass both tests. Finally, in order to keep the `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` logic, the three indices were moved to the table create blocks.

The result is that `import.sql` will have only the statements necessary to create the tables and add/remove objects that _need_ to be added or removed. Users or aliases left behind for deleted domains are ignored. Nothing is dropped, so once users have the ability to change their passwords, the integrity of those passwords is preserved, and I, as the admin, do not know what they are. This final point is very important for trust.

This PR is applied against your current master branch, so it is not dependent on anything I've already submitted. I had to provide `ansible.cfg` in order to enable the Jinja `do` extension, so I tossed in some other harmless configuration options that make for nicer command-lines at runtime.

You're going to have access to their password hash regardless, that's not a problem.

If passwords are already in the database, then I just need to not clobber them. That's a _lot_ less work than having some external setup that grabs the password, encrypts it, puts it in Ansible, and then runs Ansible to update the database. Users also expect their password change to be instantaneous. Even if I update the database directly, then extract those passwords and update Ansible, it's clunky. Now my mailserver is updating my sovereign repository, and for most users, the Ansible configuration doesn't live on the mailserver.

Right now, as you say, ""config is god,"" in every aspect. Whatever's in the config is guaranteed to match what's actually used (assuming you've run Ansible.)

After this PR, ""config is kinda-sorta-mostly-god, but only in terms of which records exist, not necessarily in terms of their data attributes -- various things could be changed directly in the database and will then not match your config, and that inconsistency could persist indefinitely."" I understand why that seems useful for passwords, but it definitely doesn't seem like an improvement in terms of simplicity or clarity of the mental model.

I wonder if there'd be some way to do this that applied _only_ to password hashes, and removed password hashes from the Ansible config entirely? I just really don't like the idea of having stuff in Ansible that is permanently out-of-sync and misleading.

I'm deploying it for a small office environment now, and they _do_ care. The workflow now with Fastmail is I set them up and give them their initial password and then tell them to change it. If they forget it, I can go back and reset it. I see this change for sovereign as the same logic. I set your initial password in the config and you change it. From that point on the password hash is ignored, as I believe _it should be_. I could add a `force: True` flag that would act as a password reset, so that the ""setting and resetting of passwords"" is still within the sysadmin domain, whether it's Ansible or some other tool.

In this configuration there is no other tool, so enabling Ansible to act like any other admin/management tool for passwords seems like the right move.

I don't know whose decision it is to merge or not merge these things - I'm just handing them over because they seem useful. I'm running them all in production, and they all solve specific problems I've encountered w/ sovereign.

I'll be sending you two more pull requests in coming days that will be built on top of these changes. I'm telling you this now so that you can consider what's coming in your decision to merge the changes provided here. 

One adds a bunch of `no_X.yml` tasks so that users who install X can later uninstall it and have all of the configuration reverted. For example, I run my own bouncer elsewhere, so I don't want `znc` left floating around. I run Openfire for XMPP, so I don't want `prosody` hanging around. I simply replace `znc.yml` with `no_znc.yml` in the `include` directive in `main.yml` for the role, and the magic happens.

The second PR reflects changes that move security items into Ansible Vault. This includes all passwords, certificates, and the tarsnap key. I've updated the documentation accordingly. 

I need to test that those changes work on a default install, which is why they're not included here. I also figure that even if you reject the `no_X` and Vault changes, having some cleanup from `ansible-lint` can't hurt.

Hopefully you'll accept them all. If not, I'll just continue running my own fork of this project.

Nothing was changed and everything seems to be okay from the perspective of playbook.

I was digging a little bit deeper and opened the MySQL DB and _it was empty_ - so even after replaying the playbook, the schema hasn't been created. Therefore I have created the schema manually using `mysql -u opendmarc -p < /usr/share/doc/opendmarc/schema.mysql` and it works now.

The DB was empty - my fault, I know. But I think there is also a problem with the playbook, more concretely [with this line](https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign/blob/jessie/roles/mailserver/tasks/opendmarc.yml#L29).

The LE config that @mikeashley set up uses the `standalone` letsencrypt plugin, which runs its own webserver, thus it needs ports 80/443 available, thus we have to shut down our Apache first.

It might be worth considering whether we should instead use the `apache` or `webroot` plugin, and have our own Apache instance serve the LetsEncrypt confirmation stuff. Then we wouldn't need to bounce it. I'm guessing @mikeashley might have more insight as to why he didn't choose that route.

527,2016-08-22 13:32:21,"By default dspam trains on messages that it passes through as being ham, essentially reinforcing its own conclusion unless told otherwise. There is no provision within the sovereign configuration for telling it otherwise. You can move messages to Junk, but they will stay there. 

I've modified my install of sovereign with files you can find in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/oskapt/0316f402dd3f8ee986f9d40a61713df6)

The steps are:
1. create a new playbook in the `mailserver` role called `local.yml` for local mods
2. add the template for `junk_training.sh` in `templates/`
3. add the two support scripts in `files/`
   - `decrypted_dspam_antispam_update-cut.sh`
   - `decrypted_dspam_antispam_update-filter.sh`

With these items we get the following:
- dynamically extract domains from `/decrypted` by looking for top-level directories owned by `vmail`
- crawl this list every 30 minutes (via cron), looking for users' `Junk` folders
- for every message in `Junk` retrain and move to `Spam`
- if we don't have a `Spam` folder for the user, create one
- if we don't have a `Ham` folder for the user, create one
- for any user with messages in the `Ham` folder, retrain as non-spam and move to `INBOX`
- additionally, go through every day and delete spam older than 30 days for everyone

This works great. I move messages to Junk, and within 30 minutes they're in Spam. If I find a message in Spam that isn't spam, I move it to Ham, and within 30 minutes it reappears in my inbox.

The only issue with this script, also recognized by the author on line 50, is that it moves to INBOX instead of pushing it back through maildrop to go through sieve rules. It hasn't yet become annoying enough for me to fix it. It also doesn't mark messages as read, so my spam folder always shows some number of unread messages. Also not yet annoying enough for me to fix.

`dspam` takes a while (2 weeks or so) to figure out what you consider to be spam, after which it starts working well. Because it self-trains on Ham, you don't have the normal Bayesian issues of also having to train it on what is not spam.

I hope this helps answer your questions about dspam!

This modularizes sovereign by moving default variables into their roles. It responds to demands for a less monolithic sovereign setup expressed in #440 and elsewhere.

Highlights:
- Users need only define two variables for all roles to work: `domain` and `main_user_name`
- All passwords are generated using ansible's [password lookup](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_lookups.html#the-password-lookup) and stored in the directory `secret`.
- Uses the ansible standard `group_vars/sovereign` instead of the bespoke `vars/user.yml`
- Default variables are moved into their respective roles (`defaults/main.yml`)

Documentation will be added and testing will be fixed if there's interest in this change.

Unless I'm mistaken, this is only a small part of addressing resuability?  As written today, some roles still make assumptions about how other roles are designed and used.  Two examples: our LE setup and duplicated postgres install/configuration.  I don't think this PR needs to full address resuability, but I want to make sure we're clear that this is only one step.

This is indeed ""only a small part of addressing resuability"", as @mikeashley puts it. The title of the PR is perhaps too ambitious. I would love to do more.

I find that inter-dependencies like postgres are difficult to deal with in ansible. I haven't seen a satisfactory solution really (although some of @drybjed's tricks in https://github.com/debops/debops are interesting). My sense is you need some sort of key-value store to register what roles have been successfully run. I'm not sure sovereign's quite ready for that. It might be easier, in practice, to remove the inter-dependencies with role-specific databases.
",ariddell,2016-05-29 22:25:34
526,2016-04-22 13:07:31,"@ariddell You are exactly right, some way to store a state in Ansible (which is inherently stateless by design) so that it can be carried over between the playbook executions, either in the same `ansible-playbook` run, or on subsequent runs, is needed to get full idempotency. In DebOps, I'm doing this using Ansible local facts stored on remote hosts (a JSON data structure with key/value data relevant to a particular role).

In the case of PostgreSQl support, which is done by the [debops.postgresql_server](http://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-postgresql_server/docs/getting-started.html) role on the server side, and [debops.postgresql](http://docs.debops.org/en/latest/ansible/roles/ansible-postgresql/docs/getting-started.html) role on the client side, I use Ansible local facts to pass the relevant data between two roles. The default variables are not good for this, because when a role is not included in the play, its variables are not ""loaded"" by Ansible. Other forms of variables available in Ansible are either not modifable through Ansible inventory, or the inventory itself which should be left under user control.

If you wonder why there are two PostgreSQL roles (and MariaDB, and similar), this allows an easy setup where the database server is on one host and clients that access the database are on another host(s).

As for remembering what roles have been executed before... I don't think that's really needed. You just need to ensure that each role is idempotent, and using the playbook, run your roles in the correct order. For example, my application roles don't really care if `nginx` role has been executed or not, they expect the webserver to just be there when it's needed.

I don't think it's strictly required, but it's necessary for some features, including bayesian learning, which I think we want available. Personally, I don't mind having Redis around; it's very useful, it's stable, and it has a small memory footprint.

Speaking of the Bayes filter, hello @hpk42 ! :-) So you can train rspamd with `rspamc learn_ham email_file1 email_file2 ...` or `rspamc learn_spam email_file1 email_file2`. Rspamd doesn't have anything set up to do that automatically, and currently this PR doesn't either. I wasn't sure how opinionated we wanted Sovereign to be on that.

One option would be a cron job that runs learn_spam/learn_ham on some specially-named ham/spam folders (probably configurable by vars?) in the main user's maildir (I think I'd need to look into how to only run it on new messages that weren't already processed). The downside of this approach is that it doesn't scale quite as well to multi-email-user Sovereign installations (though I suppose we could have it run for all configured mail accounts).

Another option (recommended by the rspamd author) is to set up local mail aliases that pipe the mail directly to learn_spam/learn_ham. The downside of this is that you need some way to conveniently redirect mail to these aliases from your MUA; e.g. Thunderbird has a ""redirect mail"" plugin that will do this.

Open to thoughts on this, though I think the PR could be merged as-is to at least make rspamd functional, and any desired setup for Bayes learning could be treated as a separate enhancement.

The main potential lack of coherence I see is that we have two milters (opendkim and rmilter) whose tasks could both be handled by rmilter. I plan to look into that in a future PR.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

In `/etc/opendkim/TrustedHosts`, I see

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

But from the perspective of the Sovereign VM, `sovereign.local` resolves to `127.0.0.1` (because it is listed as such in `/etc/hosts`, and `mail.sovereign.local` does not resolve at all (it is listed in the `/etc/hosts` of the host machine, but not of the Sovereign VM. So the host machine is not a trusted host for OpenDKIM, and since the tests run from the host machine, the test email is not DKIM-signed, and the test fails.

Can others reproduce this, or am I doing something wrong?

I think the simplest fix is to add the IP address of the host machine to `/etc/opendkim/TrustedHosts` when running under Vagrant. I've verified that that does in fact cause the test to pass.

another issue. I'm going to just cherry-pick the useful commits in the

i am just browsing through this project and couldn't find anything related... are domain aliases supported in the mail-configuration?

My assumption is that @simontretter tested his patch with the 0.6.3 package.

If there is a problem getting these different versions to work do to version differences we should consider doing a [PyPi installation of v1.1.x](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Radicale/).

Also, the radicale team [recommends](http://radicale.org/news/) that users upgrade to 1.1.x as soon as possible because ""Many improvements in this release are related to security"".

462,2016-11-01 16:07:56,"I rebased this branch on the master branch and ran into some minor glitches while setting up a new Sovereign system today.
1. The `python3-passlib` seems no longer be available in Debian 8.6, I simply removed all `python3` packages from the [radicale.yml](https://github.com/simontretter/sovereign/blob/13ec85d65f92e1f9c0c7971efefd953780f47240/roles/radicale/tasks/radicale.yml#L4-L10) file, it seems to work without these.
2. It references the `{{ selfoss_domain }}` variable the [etc_apache2_sites-available_radicale.j2](https://github.com/simontretter/sovereign/blob/13ec85d65f92e1f9c0c7971efefd953780f47240/roles/radicale/templates/etc_apache2_sites-available_radicale.j2) file which does not work when you choose not to include selfoss. Why doesn't it simply use the `{{ radicale_domain }}` variable? The error log also points to selfoss, a copy & paste oversight?
3. The SSL config in the [etc_apache2_sites-available_radicale.j2 ](https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign/pull/462/files#diff-ba2fec315fa8bfa74d861d521237cd18R10) template can't be loaded by Apache. Probably should use `SSLEngine On`.
4. The certificate paths in [config.j2](https://github.com/simontretter/sovereign/blob/13ec85d65f92e1f9c0c7971efefd953780f47240/roles/radicale/templates/config.j2#L27-L31) point to the wrong location as we use Let's Encrypt now, see the `/etc/letsencrypt/live/{{ domain }}/` directory.
5. Also needs to add the `dav` subdomain to the Let's Encrypt [list](https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign/blob/a518f9c0353384cfb315d276a3419864fb9846ae/roles/common/files/letsencrypt-gencert#L3) or it won't be included in the certificate.
6. No Debian expert here but it seems you need to enable the service before you can use it now: `sudo systemctl enable radicale`.
7. The role does not configure the firewall, it should open port `5232` which it does not.
8. Minor one: old style variables are depreciated in newer Ansible versions so [`radicale_accounts`](https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign/pull/462/files#diff-b09d9d7eea6c54e7c1f737d48e0cc2a3R55) becomes `'{{ radicale_accounts }}'`.

455,2015-12-31 00:22:48,"Happy New Year.  Here is a different approach to using LetsEncrypt to replace the wildcard certificate we currently use.  As before, this is a draft pull request to advance the discussion in issue #426.  It's incomplete but illustrates the approach.

In contrast to my first pull request #451, this generates only one certificate using Subject Alternative Names to list the subdomains that Sovereign roles may use.  Since we are not using a wildcard certificate, roles are always going to have their fingers in certificate generation.  Given that, I went for broke and listed subdomains explicitly.

Based on feedback from #451, I put the LetsEncrypt stuff in a separate task list but elected to keep it in the common role.  It just doesn't seem warranted to put it in a separate role.  Also, I added a cron script to renew the certificate periodically (once a month in this draft).

Examples of when it would be useful for LE to notify you: major changes in their service and security problems with their certificates.

For the target user of Sovereign, what's the right way to default this: require the email address or make it optional?  I think expecting an email address is the right default since that is what the LE team wants.  Do we not trust them with an email address?

A complication is that autoconfig is set up to serve HTTP and HTTPS due to ambiguity in the documentation (or so says the comments on autoconfig.conf).

Note that the domain name in question also appears in the `RedirectMatch` line. I don't think you can do a general solution without using mod_rewrite. But it's ansible so by putting variables in the templates we easily replace the domain name / host name in the configuration files.

As far as restarting apache after changing certificates is concerned, you can run ""`apachectl graceful`"", it will restart the server without interrupting running requests (no downtime, no service interruption). Also it will not restart the server if there is an error in the configuration.

of concerns, IMHO.

the tasks any more than by having different programs do them. It's also
a separation which is consistent with the way nginx is often used.

@aridell I don't mind switching to nginx completely, but I'm not fond of using two different pieces of HTTP server software on one machine. It just wastes RAM (which is the most expensive resource on a rented server). It also doubles the attack surface. Apache is perfectly capable of serving this redirect (as is nginx, of course).

We can try to get rid of all `VirtualHost` instances on port 80 and use `mod_redirect` on the default instance listening on port 80 to do the redirects in a generic way and an `Alias` to serve the ACME files if you guys prefer that.

That said, I'm not the one who is implementing this feature so if you love this idea, don't mind my babbling.

449,2015-12-20 09:22:59,"**P.S**: This took me a while to figure out, which is why this issue description is more verbose than is necessary.

I recently faced this issue when I renewed my SSL certificates from AlphaSSL. I copied over the new private and public keys to `roles/common/files` and everything was fine in the web-facing portion (`read`, `blog`, `mail` etc). However, my Dovecot started failing with private key issues. So I started going through the usual phases of debugging whether my private and public keys match, testing my certificate with the `pem` file and so on.

When all those worked as expected (as in no issues with my keys themselves), I turned to the sovereign repository to figure out what could be causing the issue (first by checking reported issues and then by looking at commits), which is when I landed on [this](https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign/commit/ca8a3713207206998aecdbf00894a64e0ec8cf3e) commit.

Long story short, I had to remove the `/etc/ssl/certs/wildcard_combined.pem` file already present in the server so that Ansible would create a new one for me. The issue is because Ansible doesn't check for changed contents in the `shell` command we are running, instead it checks only for presence or absence of the file.

The Ansible [assemble](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/assemble_module.html) command seems like a possible fix, but I'm not sold on it yet. Any other options to fixing this issue?

A configuration GUI that runs on the server is antithetical to configuration management tools such as Ansible.

Even so the Debian maintainer keeps an ancient 2.3.7 in Debian, it is trivial to build a current Debian package from the sources since it already contains the necessary data.

Ansible and Postfixadmin are not antithetical as incorrectly claimed above, but in fact complement each other. One is for setting up and configuring the server, the other for the day to day usage and management of the mail service. For example: You wouldn't use Ansible to create your user account and projects on Github either or would you?

I am sure I am able to integrate postfixadmin with Sovereign once it is
set up with a current version of Debian testing.
I know next to nothing about Ansible and Python is definitely not my
language of choice but I think I'll manage.

My integration effort just might not be Sovereign compatible (i.e. no
yaml config / playbook or whatever). I don't know yet how many configs
I'll need to amend.
At the very least the postfix and Dovecot configs, some Postgresql,
possibly Roundcube,

I might out myself as dense and backward here, but I don't really see
what Ansible/Sovereign gives me beyond a one-off installation script.
While tracking Debian testing I'll always encounter config changes that
I'll need to resolve manually. How does Ansible/Sovereign help
me there? I'd REALLY appreciate some enlightenment here.

And yes, my private mail servers have been tracking Debian since
~0.93R6. First with what would later be called unstable,
then I switched to testing when testing was introduced in Debian. First
running sendmail, then since ~1999 postfix.
Sticking to the stable release was never my thing, at least not for my
private servers. :-)
",neuffer,2016-05-21 10:29:49
448,2016-04-18 19:09:20,"@neuffer The idea with Ansible is precisely that it is _not_ a one-time install tool, but the single source of truth for your server's configuration. All configuration changes are made via Ansible and are thus tracked in a VCS and fully reproducible. Ideally you should be able at any point to backup your data, destroy your server, create a brand-new server with the same OS, run Ansible against it, restore your data, and be right back in business.

Given that the whole point of Ansible is reproducible servers, it is more difficult when tracking an unstable underlying distribution target. You can certainly have an Ansible config targeting ""the latest Debian testing"", it just means that Ansible config is likely to need updating more frequently as changes are made in the underlying OS.

You should really never touch a configuration file manually/directly on a server managed by Ansible.

I wanted to provision sovereign on my jessie server, so I picked up the jessie branch, but later found out that there are changes in master that I'd like to have, and then it started becoming a mess. I believe the idea is that the jessie branch merges master every now and then to be up to date.

I believe dropping support for one of the currently supported distros is not an option, right? They are all still deployed at scale I suppose.

Then each role's OS support can be declared independently, and the transition can happen in stages.

Using ansible galaxy would bring some other advantages: people could use our roles à la carte and they'd be listed in the galaxy directory.

Consider this a +1 for splitting up the roles. It's then much easier to support multiple versions of a distro, since you're mostly importing different package lists, or swapping different config lines according to `ansible_distribution_version`.

I do like the project, but I am unable to use any of the roles because of the current monolithic structure of the project. And many people seem to be in the same situation. Having software reusable is the right approach in 99% of the cases. 
I don't see a strong argument for a monolithic structure in sovereign.

I'm just now working on my first Sovereign server, but the only method of use that I've seriously considered is having my own local private branch of the repo, and merging in regularly from the mainline branch it's based on (`jessie` branch in my case). Given the need to set `vars/user.yml`, add tarsnap key, etc, it seems like that's pretty much a requirement. And once you're doing that anyway, it seems easy enough to also comment out roles from `site.yml`, modify roles as needed, even add new ones (I plan on doing some of all three).

So while I think modularity has some benefits in theory, I don't think I see enough benefit in this case to justify the additional coordination costs that would be imposed on the maintainers when making changes.

I've got a personal private fork of sovereign with my local modifications (like `vars/user.yml`) that I periodically pull from upstream.

I suppose this comes down to privacy (i.e., fingerprinting resistance)

much in the spirit of sovereign.

426,2015-12-12 11:55:40,"Hello everyone, developer of [DebOps](http://debops.org/) here. :-) I've written a role that can handle certificates (actually most of the PKI structure) in Ansible and let me tell you one thing - don't do it in pure Ansible, it's unmanageable. Write a script that can do all necessary actions like key/cert generation, install it on the host and use Ansible to configure it an launch all necessary tasks. Just don't put the logic in the role/playbook itself.

I'm currently working on a `acme-tiny`-based implementation of the PKI, with ACME being added to ""internal"" sets of certificates handled by a set of CAs managed by Ansible Controller, and ""external"" set of certificates managed by a custom script provided by the user - each set of finished certificates (I call that a ""realm"") will automatically pick either external, ACME, or internal certs depending on their availability, so that internal hosts not reachable from the Internet can also have certificates. It doesn't really mater what certificates a service uses, as long as the clients have a maching trusted CA certificate, so my goal here is to have a valid set at all times.

As for the support in `nginx` (maybe you could consider switching, hint, hint), it's [already done](https://github.com/debops/ansible-nginx/pull/91) in my `debops.nginx` role. You can also read [notes about the design](https://github.com/debops/ansible-nginx/blob/master/docs/acme-support.rst) to see how it is supposed to work.

426,2015-12-12 12:25:00,"Hi @drybjed. Thanks for coming over here to comment.

I've been trying out debops myself and I do like some of the tricks being used to make ansible roles more module (the debops.etc_services is quite nice). On balance, I think it _should_ be a model for how to modularize our roles.

I'm not a fan of `debops.pki`, which is how debops manages certs -- but I take it neither are you @drybjed? How easy would it be to use `debops.nginx` and your `acme` role without using any other `debops` roles? (In particular, sovereign uses ufw (not ferm).)

If we use ACME/Lets-Encrypt we also need to make those certificates available for the mail server -- do I have that right? How complicated will this be?

(If there's interest in re-using debops' solution, I'd be willing to audit/review the code.)
",ariddell,2016-03-06 16:04:36
426,2015-12-12 12:50:57,"Hey @ariddell :-) Ironically, Sovereign was one of the catalysts for making DebOps - I just wanted to do it better ;P

Current `debops.pki` available in the `master` branch was my first attempt at making any sort of Public Key Infrastructure, and it shows. It's like a house of cards, you change one thing and everything falls apart. I wrote it almost a year ago, and always planned to redo it after some time, when I found out what worked and what didn't. Now I'm ready to write it again, this time better and easier to control, and with more bells and whistles like ACME.

There is no ""DebOps ACME"" role, the ACME support will be incorporated into `debops.pki`. The reason is, not all hosts that can be managed by DebOps are expected to be reachable by the Let's Encrypt CA over the Internet, and I still want them to use TLS connections. So the support for different types of certificates will be kind of stackable - by default the internal certificates will be used, if ACME are present they will be preferred, and any external certificates provided by the user via a script will take precedence (think their own company PKI infrastructure).

Don't think of the set of certificates signed by Let's Encrypt as only for the webserver, it's a mistake. X.509 certificates are agnostic. You just need to make sure that you provide them in a standardized location and configure your various services to use them. Coincidentally, that's what `debops.pki` aims to do, to make a stable and known environment for other roles to use certificates. For example path to where certificates are stored is saved as an Ansible local fact, which other Ansible roles can use to configure certificate support in their services. That way, I don't need to worry about `nginx` role maintaining its own set, it just hooks up to `debops.pki` infrastructure if it's present, automatically.

As for using Sovereign with DebOps roles... One issue might be heavy use of role dependencies in roles like `debops.nginx` or similar. I'm currently in the middle of refactoring things to move ""hard"" role dependencies into [the corresponding playbook](https://github.com/debops/debops-playbooks/tree/master/playbooks/service) of each role - after that you could use them in Sovereign without much issue, apart from handling missing firewall support, for example. But it will take some time, other things like ACME took precedence. You can right now disable `debops.nginx` role dependencies by setting `nginx_dependencies: False` in the Ansible inventory, that way they will be just skipped.
",drybjed,2016-03-06 16:04:36
426,2015-12-12 13:16:00,"@drybjed very glad to hear about these efforts. I'd love to see `debops` become even more modular.

So it looks like sovereign could get by with a pki role which is lighter than debops's debops.pki. We _do_ anticipate that every host using sovereign will be able to talk to the Let's Encrypt ACME server. I think this would allow for a great deal of simplification. Sovereign may be able to get away with a single, simple `acme` role.

Perhaps this is a good place to start the modularization it sounds like we all seem to want (#440): a branch/repo of sovereign that just installs nginx (or apache) and fetches a certificate from lets-encrypt. Each role could have its own repo, following debops' example.

I was just going to write this on the wiki but I noticed that we don't have permissions.

For people who want to setup sftp for people to access their www folder you will need to disable the google authentication. Otherwise, programs like Filezilla won't cooperate and you will not be allowed access unless you setup a google authentication file.

Sooo... 
# Modify your PAM configuration

`sudo /etc/pam.d/sshd`
change `auth required pam_google_authenticator.so` by adding the `nullok` at the end

Essentially, this tells the google authenticator to allow the login so that someone can setup google authentication.

While this is overblown for this project (as it's not a whole infrastructure set of boxes) I think the idea of 'Profiles: technology-specific wrapper classes' and 'Roles: business-specific wrapper classes' is a good one, for example calling the role (ansible role now) `webserver` and not `apache`.

408,2015-08-20 23:01:31,"(Disclaimer: I'm a bit of a security nut)
So when I set up a new VPS these days the configuration I usually end up going with is:
- Disable ssh access to the root user (only way to actually use root is to `sudo su root`)
- Create a new non privileged user called ""deploy"" or something that has sudo access via an arbitrarily long password
- Install things using this user

There are two main security reasons why I do this:
- If your key does get compromised in some way, the attacker will only have non privileged access to the server, and will still have to break your password in order to get root access.
- It's too easy and tempting to install software as root if you ssh in as root (a lot of people do). If the attacker manages to get arbitrary code execution through an exploit in one of your services, they aren't able to do nearly as much damage if the service is running as a non privileged user.

The current README encourages passwordless sudo. I think root with public key login isn't much different from passwordless sudo with a non-root public key login.

I've also noticed that when I enter a TXT record in my DNS my SMTP stops working, but only when I'm using a mail client. Roundcube still seems to send emails okay. When I remove the TXT record mail client's SMTP works again.

The TXT record i used is the simplest available:

`v=DMARC1; p=none`

Doing a `chown` to the opendmarc user and group instead of root removes this error and all messages are now being processed. Looks as though this also solves the issue I was having with SMTP too.

It's true that if their infrastructure is compromised, they could upload new code, a new key, and nobody would be the wiser.

Unfortunately, I don't see a good way to validate their key.  A quick google for the key hashes didn't turn up anything.  We could download their key, but that would only tell us of a future key change.  Then, we wouldn't know if that's an intended key rotation or compromised infrastructure.

I also took the liberty of consolidating the repeated SSL configuration in a single include file, though I can back that out if that's an unwelcome change.  It's probably worth drawing your attention to the location I chose for this new SSL config:  `/etc/apache2/ssl.conf`

Some other obvious locations I considered:
- `/etc/apache2/conf.d/ssl.conf` — this won't work because anything in this directory apparently gets included by default in `httpd.conf`, and this leads to an invalid apache because of (I think) repeated `SSLEngine on` directives (I can dig up the specific error if that would be useful)
- `/etc/apache2/conf-available/ssl.conf` — on wheezy, the `conf-available` directory is present _after_ a new machine has been provisioned, but it's not present at the point where I'm writing this config file.  It would obviously be easy to add a task to create that directory, if that would be preferable!

`The Dovecot LDA is a local delivery agent, which takes mail from an MTA and delivers it to a user's mailbox, while keeping Dovecot index files up to date. Nowadays you should probably use the LMTP server instead, because it's somewhat easier to configure (especially related to permissions) and gives better performance.`

This basically sums up why I'd recommend you to use dovecot lmtp instead of lda. lda is a short running process which is started everytime a mail is delivered while dovecot lmtp is long running and doesn't have the associated overhead of starting a process each time.

374,2015-05-30 14:13:10,"I noticed that the submission protocol is disabled in [master.cf](https://github.com/al3x/sovereign/blob/master/roles/mailserver/files/etc_postfix_master.cf).

According to [RFC6409](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6409), the submission protocol / port 587 is 
- the port which should be used for mails from a MUA (mail user agent)
- must require authentication
- for client->server communication.

Port 25/465 are for message relay, which is server->server communication. Port 465 uses SSL/TLS before the smtp communication starts, while 25 shall promote starttls via smtp protocol which may be used to upgrade the connection to use SSL/TLS. Port 465/ssmtp has been deprecated in 1998(!).

Even though this settings seems to exist since the first commit to the project, there has been a bit of discussion about this: https://github.com/al3x/sovereign/pull/318
This discussion is ended by stating that STARTTLS is less secure then using ssmtp, because ISPs previously tampered with the STARTTLS flag. In this case, this is untrue the submission protocol/port 587 should definitely be used. By using `smtpd_tls_auth_only = yes` in [master.cf](https://github.com/al3x/sovereign/blob/master/roles/mailserver/templates/etc_postfix_main.cf.j2#L46), it is already ensured that clients can only authenticate when using tls, mitigating any tampering from ISPs.

I happened to stumble upon this when looking through your project, but don't actually use it, and therefore don't have a complete overview of your config. Because of this, even though I'm a professional mailserver admin, I ask you to create a PR for this yourself keeping your complete config in mind.

If there is an active man-in-the-middle attack (such as stripping STARTTLS), the clients must be configured to enforce STARTTLS, otherwise the attacker can talk plain text to the client and use STARTTLS while talking to the server.

IETF Draft: SMTP Require TLS Option

https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fenton-smtp-require-tls/
",ariddell,2016-09-11 09:48:07
374,2016-02-27 22:33:23,"I only read a few passages of the proposal: It seems a) unrelated to this issue b) not very useful to me. 
Some providers already allow their users to select whether an email should only be delivered if it can be done in an encrypted fashion. (see for example https://mailbox.org/en/ensuring-emails-are-sent-securely/). 
It also a) requires sysadmins of the receiving servers to change their system b) users to adapt (apart from software updates needed for MTAs and MUAs). It effectively secures MTA->MTA traffic.
DANE is superior for this IMO and needs only the sysadmins of the receiving system to implement changes. (Even though it definitely is harder to achieve than to just update your MTA to a version which supports REQUIRETLS)

So, back to this issue: It largely depends whether an MUA is configured to figure out whether the remote smtp server supports TLS automatically at each connection, or whether it is done once at the setup of the account (may be assisted to choose the right values using autoconfiguration). Most often, it's probably the latter option that is used. If an downgrade attack occurs after this initial account setup, the user is secure as the connection will fail because it's client is configured to use STARTTLS.

So, there is not really an issue with enabling this (and shutting down SMTPS/ port 465).

Btw, this is a utility you can test stripping STARTTLS with: https://github.com/tintinweb/striptls
In this case (as this utility supports so many other ways to manipulate STARTTLS connections, you probably want to use `striptls --listen 0.0.0.0:588 --remote localhost:25 --vectors=SMTP.StripFromCapabilities`. Now you can just set your client to connect to port 588 and you will see whether the stripping attack works or not.

Works like a charm - fortunately, only when a client is configured to not always use STARTTLS.

Thunderbird will give you an error like this for example:

> An error occurred while sending mail: Unable to establish a secure link with Outgoing server (SMTP) %S using STARTTLS since it doesn't advertise that feature. Switch off STARTTLS for this server or contact your service provider.

",neuhaus,
373,2016-05-21 12:49:51,"I investigated this on the jessie branch for Apache.  Debian 8 stable uses openssl 1.0.1k, so the DH parameters would need to be appended to the site certificates.

However, the current server configuration seems to already mitigate logjam.  I tested my server from [here](https://weakdh.org/sysadmin.html), and it reported my server as safe.  I also reviewed the report returned for my site by the [Qualys SSL Labs tester](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html).  It indicated that we're not using common DH primes, and we're not reusing DH public server params.

Does anything actually need to be done for Apache?  I'm not a security expert; just reporting what I'm seeing.  Could somebody more qualified assess this?
",mikeashley,
373,2016-05-21 12:59:22,"I think openvpn is ok.  The server configuration uses DH parameters.  The key size in the defaults is 2048 bits.  The task list generates the parameters.  These were done as part of Joshua Lund's commits on 2013-10-07.

Summary of where I think we're at: postfix and dovecot are ok, openvpn is ok, apache needs a look (see previous comment).
",mikeashley,
373,2016-09-16 12:37:52,"I looked at this again.  We are running Apache 2.4.10 on master.  I reviewed the [mod_ssl documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ssl.html).  It looks like we are ""ok"" with no changes, since mod_ssl uses standardized DH parameters corresponding to key length.  Logjam appears to be mitigated.

However, we may still want to use the custom DH parameters we are generating for postfix for some additional security as well as consistency.  It's easy enough to reference the parameters using the new [SSLOpenSSLConfCmd](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslopensslconfcmd) directive, but we would need to use OpenSSL 1.0.2 from Debian backports.

I'm recommending we do this and close this issue.  Any feedback?
",mikeashley,
373,2016-09-16 12:41:03,"Yes, we finally reached the stage described in [my comment from last December](https://github.com/sovereign/sovereign/issues/373#issuecomment-163578499)!
",neuhaus,
373,2016-09-17 12:36:28,"I am still troubleshooting why I can't get Apache to accept the `SSLOpenSSLConfCmd` directive.

Upgrading the libssl1.0.0 package from jessie-backports is not sufficient.  It does update libssl to 1.0.2h, but the next problem appears to be that `mod_ssl.so` in jessie does not have support for `SSLOpenSSLConfCmd` compiled into the module.  At least, `strings mod_ssl.so` does not give me any references to `SSLOpenSSLConfCmd`.  I am guessing its build was configured with a version of libssl < 1.0.2.  I can confirm this hypothesis by building apache 2.4.10 from source with a version of libssl >= 1.0.2 and then checking its `mod_ssl.so`.

I'm posting this in case somebody can tell me I'm on the wrong track or if somebody is using `SSLOpenSSLConfCmd` and can share their configuration with me.
",mikeashley,
373,2016-09-17 13:04:43,"Read the source code for mod_ssl in Apache 2.4.10.  Indeed, it elides support for the `SSLOpenSSLConfCMD` directive if compiled against an unsupporting version of libssl.  Skimming dependencies, I think we'll need to go after the Apache package from Debian testing.
",mikeashley,
373,2016-10-22 11:22:18,"Or wait for Apache 2.4.23 to land in backports, which is where I am leaning.  I am concerned about breaking dependencies if we pull from Debian testing.  Logjam is currently mitigated, and it doesn't seem worth the configuration headache to use custom DH parameters.
",mikeashley,

You'll find similar sections in the other Apache configuration files used for various services in Sovereign. To get your desired non-SSL, you can move the body of the `<VirtualHost *:443>` block below into the top `<VirtualHost *:80>` section, removing the `Redirect permanent /` directive. You can delete the SSL-relative directives, of course :)

Not sure what your experience level with this stuff is, but it might be helpful to know that port 443 is used for HTTP over SSL, while port 80 is used for unencrypted HTTP traffic. Wherever you see port 443, that's probably something you'll want to change for your setup. Good luck!

could you add a note about how to proceed after a reboot?
I just added a filesystem for /encrypted (10GB) and found out how to re-mount it with encfs /encrypted /decrypted + passphrase.

So, one reboots the server one needs to do that manually? 
(makes sense to force entering the pw, i get that much)

But after this it seems the daemons have some problem, specifically roundcube won't access some folders any more with a permission issue.

Having an idea how reboot is normally handled would be good. Running on a VPS means sometimes there will be a reboot for external reasons anyway.

361,2015-02-25 18:36:20,"Yes, you need to enter the password for any encrypted volumes on reboot. This is not Sovereign-specific, but rather a function of how EncFS works.

It is possible that some daemons may need to be restarted after you enter your password for the encrypted volume, as they may have stalled out while looking for resources that will only be available once the volume is decrypted and visible to the daemon user accounts.

355,2015-02-18 15:51:22,"I ended up generating one SSL certificate for each site as mentioned. To those trying to figure this out you simply need to do the following

Within each conf file you will need to change the following code.

<code>
    SSLEngine on
    SSLProtocol ALL -SSLv2 -SSLv3
    SSLHonorCipherOrder On
    SSLCipherSuite ECDH+AESGCM:DH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:DH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+AES:ECDH$

    SSLCertificateKeyFile   /etc/ssl/private/NEW_SSL_KEY.key
    SSLCACertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/COMBINED_INTERMEDIATE_ROOT.pem
</code>

Now if you are using startssl they you can simply modify the existing SSLCACertificate and replacing the wildcard_ca.pem file. This might make your life a little easier.

Also you need to copy all of these files into /etc/ssl/private and /etc/ssl/certs and modify the permissions to match the rest.

This is my setup:

VPS: Digital Ocean Debian 7 VM
Roundcube Version: 0.9.x from the Wheezy Backports recent commit.
Owncloud: 7.0.4
CardDav URL: https://cloud(dot)(domain)(dot)com/remote.php/carddav/addressbooks/(OC Username)/contacts

Here's what I did: I copied the Owncloud CardDav URL, went to Roundcube Settings -> CardDav and added a new Address Book with that URL. Initially, I set the sync frequency to every 1 hour, but beyond importing the first contact, Roundcube did nothing. I changed the frequency to every 1 minute with the same result as well.

It's been two days and Roundcube has now imported about 15 contacts. It is still happening. It doesn't stop, but I have no idea what this issue is. Deleting the address book and re-adding it also doesn't help.

To confirm whether it wasn't an issue with my Owncloud server, I setup CardDav syncing with my Nokia Lumia 720 running Windows Phone 8.1 through the ICloud account hack. It synced everything up immediately. It doesn't have any issues syncing up changes I make either way as well.

If I did this in a non-ideal way, I'd like to learn how to do it better next time. This is my first real OSS commit via git/github, so accept with caution.

acceptable.  I have filed ansible/ansible-modules-core#625 to ask that

If you omit the slash, visiting the url `http://test1.example/foo` will redirect to
`https://test1.examplefoo`. With a trailing slash the redirect will go to `https://test1.example/foo`, which is better.

I believe I had a bad VM snapshot when testing this.  I had a snapshot I made after running the common and mailserver playbooks.  I must have tampered with the VM prior to snapshotting, because mysql is installed.  I believe that's what led the roundcube package install script to use mysql instead of postgres.

When starting from a clean Debian 7 VM, mysql is not installed after running the common and mailserver playbooks.  Adding webmail and running again works fine.  Postgres is used for roundcube's database as expected.

Changes:
- Added backports to apt configuration.
- Updated roundcube task to use the roundcube backport.
- Updated roundcube's main.inc.php configuration file to use the one included in the backport distribution.  Migrated configuration parameters from the existing configuration file except in cases where it looked like the Roundcube team was changing defaults that were not touched by Sovereign's configuration.

Ubuntu has the advantage of long term support and the current distribution 14.04 LTS has more recent packages than Debian 7 so some packages such as gitolite3 do not require compilation etc.
Also, if we widen the audience for the project by including Ubuntu it will result in more contributions.

Regarding this patch: It wouldn't be much work to make it compatible with both Debian 7 and Ubuntu 14.04 and they would both use the same 0.9.x version then which seems like a good idea. For an example, look at `roles/owncloud/tasks/owncloud.yml`.

You suggestion leads to the following development cycle.

1) Have an idea for a new role or an improvement to an existing role.
2) Manually implement the role on every supported distribution.
3) Find any differences in the configurations, across VMs.  Don't miss anything!
4) Implement Ansible scripts with static configuration files and specialized templates per distribution.
5) Update testing scripts to check that the different packages were set up correctly.

Best case: the packages are the same, but I still have to do work proportional to the number of distributions supported to verify that.  Worst case, there are differences, and I need to carefully work out the differences and set up the configuration files.  Then, I have to understand all versions of the packages in enough detail to write proper tests to ensure I got it correct in the Ansible playbooks.

I ended up having the same problem this morning; here's how I fixed it.
1. Killed the apt-get process.  In hindsight this was a bad move (because it left the dpkg processes running), so try skipping this step.
2. Doing a _ps|grep dpkg_ showed three relevant processes:
   1. /usr/bin/dpkg --force-confdef --force-confold --status-fd 21 --configure roundcube-pgsql:all roundcube-core:all roundcube-plugins:all roundcube:all
   2. /usr/bin/perl -w /usr/share/debconf/frontend /var/lib/dpkg/info/roundcube-core.postinst configure 0.7.2-9+deb7u1
   3. /bin/sh /var/lib/dpkg/info/roundcube-core.postinst configure 0.7.2-9+deb7u1
3. I killed the third one, the roundcube postinit script.  This cleanly stopped the perl and dpkg processes (and probably would have allowed for a graceful exit of the apt-get process, but I don't know what ansible would have done).
4. I then ran _dpkg --configure -a_ to try completing the roundcube install.
   1. I refused the dbconfig-common installation, as I figured the db was already set up.
   2. I kept the local configuration file - the only differences between the local file and the new file were that the new file didn't have the db information.
   3. It asked to do a db update, I selected yes.
   4. It then asked for the password of the db admin user, with a note that this should not be required for postgres.  However, entering an empty password displays the error ""Empty passwords unsupported with PostgreSQL"" (this was most likely the cause of the hang).  So instead I entered the postgres admin password.
   5. Finally I allowed the update of main.inc.php.

After this process completed, roundcube appeared to be updated and working, so I ran the ansible playbook again and this time it completed without error.

I'm getting errors like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Without knowing too much about Dovecot's implementation of dbox, I believe this is trying to use an atomic rename to change a transaction log. Filesystem renames are usually atomic, so you move dovecot.index.log to dovecot.index.log.2, and then write out dovecot.index.log. If you lose power/crash while writing, you have the .2 to recover with.

As such, this seems like a possibility for data corruption if this doesn't succeed and there is for example a power loss while writing this file. I'm guessing when the rename fails, Dovecot silently overwrites dovecot.index.log and hopes it finishes.

The cause appears to be that the mail directories are set to 644 owned vmail:dovecot, but while being worked on they change to vmail:vmail, and then dovecot can't change them.

My permissions on one of the mentioned folders look like this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I'm not quite sure to solve this, as I don't know the function of the vmail user/group or how it's used. I could just chown vmail:dovecot and call it a day, but I'm guessing this will pop up again. Anyone know the best way to resolve this?

The problem is that under OS X `crypt.methods` equals to `[<crypt.METHOD_CRYPT>]` and that crypt.crypt() uses the first method available unless one is specified. Because of this behavior I suggest to change the command used to generate the Dovecot password to force `crypt.METHOD_SHA512` because you cannot guarantee that it will be the default for method-less calls to `crypt.crypt()`.

As for the command not working under OS X I think it should be sufficient to make it clear that they work only under Linux, thus should be run on the server (or any platform which provides `crypt.METHOD_SHA512` and `crypt.METHOD_SHA256` for that matter).

For my own project, lowar, I actually specify that a set of ssh keys need to be generated for the deploy user, and then automatically upload those. The setup play is here: https://github.com/adrinux/Lowar/blob/master/skeleton/play-setup.yml

I had wondered about suggesting porting this to sovereign instead of having people manually setup the deploy user – perhaps that's a better option if you're happy with generating keys specifically for the deploy user.

Sovereign takes a different approach of having people modify and add to the roles themselves, and generally put personal config in the same repo, or at least directory.

It adds githubs public key to the deploy user's known_hosts file prior to trying to clone gitolite from github.

cons:
- Public key is hard coded, this will break and require a change if github updates their key (but how often does that happen?)
- I'm not sure the gitolite role is the best place to add this, I'd do it as part of setting up the deploy user account, but sovereign currently does that manually...but it's where its currently needed to get the vagrant testing box up and running without manual intervention.

There is a problem, now, for all existing installations. When running this new playbook, they are going to receive another copy of each file. To make this upgrade go smoothly, we'll need to also delete the non-`.conf` version of each file in `sites-available` and the symlinks in `sites-enabled`.

  Here is my submission for Newebe (more infos here: #228).
It sets up three daemons:
- Newebe: a Python program that runs the Newebe instance.
- CouchDB: The database used by Newebe.
- Supervisor: a process manager in Python that manages the Newebe daemon.

It adds a configuration to Apache2: 
- a reverse proxy between newebe.{{soevereign_domain}}:443 and localhost:8282.

I hope everything is ok. Tell me if I must change something.

Regards,

Frank

The VPN client software I use on Mac OS X, Viscosity, doesn't seem to receive that push, despite following [their DNS instructions](http://www.sparklabs.com/support/configuring_dns_and_wins_setti/) closely. However, I can manually set my VPN connection to use 10.8.0.1, and then DNS leak test confirms that I'm using Linode's resolver, as is appropriate for my Sovereign setup.

My suggestion is to check out your OpenVPN client settings and then reopen if you still think this is an issue.

Can you elaborate on how it failed? I don’t think the mail system has changed too much since December, so I would expect that it should mostly be upgradable in-place. I recently did a similarly big update to my own server (2-3 months worth of changesets) and it went pretty smoothly.

Even if you do a complete reinstall, I think you will be able to simply restore dovecot’s data directories and have everything work (as long as you create exactly the same email accounts, etc.). That seems more straightforward than restoring via IMAP.

However, the switch to Postgres is messing up Roundcube. The Ansible script stops at ""set round cube password"" with the error ""database 'roundcube' does not exist"". Now whenever I visit roundcube I get the ""Database Error! Connection failed"" message. Unfortunately, I know next-to-nothing about Postgres so I can't really diagnose the issue easily. Also, any further re-runs of the ansible script do not produce the error (it's as if it _thinks_ everything is configured correctly the second time).

So far my researching and trying things out has not solved the issue but I do feel more confident that at least my mail setup won't entire be broken; I can still access it via IMAP.

3. Immediately stop most services manually (so they don’t attempt to do anything during the restore)
4. Restore the directories from backup

6. Re-run the playbooks (to remount the encfs and ensure the services are started)

In `/decrypted/dspam/data/example.com/username/username.stats`, I get something like `0,9999,0,0,0,0`, indicating that 9999 messages were allowed through as ham, and 0 were detected as spam.

I also have a set of data directories located in `/decrypted/dspam/data/unix:/run/dspam/dspam.sock/username/`. These ones are referenced from `dspam_filter_access`.

I also have `/decrypted/dspam/data/dspam/username/username.stats` because the user argument to `dspam` is `${user}@${nexthop}`, but the value of nexthop is `dspam`.

Essentially, different components of the dspam system are looking in different data directories, preventing any training from ever happening. I have a patch for this and have done a fair amount of research, but I'm hoping someone else can corroborate these findings first...

One big thing, you authenticate with ""user@domain.com"" to IMAP but you use ""user"" for Owncloud over CalDAV/CardDAV. PHP-Push-2 only can receive one set of credentials. To fix this I recommend opening up the source files for caldav.php and carddav_0c5.php under backend and putting in a regex to get just the local part of the email, something like ([^@]+) and use that as the username. This also means that your Owncloud and Dovecot passwords must be in sync.

As a local workaround, I stop the postgresql service during the backup run, and I've rescheduled the cronjob to 3am so the downtime isn't an issue.

Probably the ideal would be to use pgdump so we can do a live database backup (it would also result in a smaller backup size).

I started off with Sovereign on Linode. Everything seemed fine, except when I needed to reboot the server. After doing that, things just stopped working. IMAP, SMTP, etc. I issued reload's on dovecot and postfix and that didn't help. Looking at the logs, I can see one error that encfs directories are not mounted. So I mount it with sudo and I get a permission denied error when it tries and chdir. 

It's not just SMTP/IMAP though, it's Owncloud as well. I'm getting this error after a reboot:  [14] SQLSTATE[HY000] [14] unable to open database file

It's worth noting that I ran sovereign multiple times to get past errors involving ufw and znc. I am willing to do a fresh install and go from the top again to get to the bottom of this, especially if it can help someone in the future. I'm currently on DigitalOcean, but I'll be keeping a Linode instance for a couple days longer.

There is potential for getting into a difficult state if the services start running without `/decrypted` being available. Some services may initialize new data files, and then be confused when there old ones reappear.

Personally, I had an unexpected restart in the middle of the night a couple weeks ago. I re-ran the sovereign playbooks a few hours later and everything came up clean. However, I was not running the very latest sovereign (I was still using MySQL instead of Postgres).

In some of the deployment tools one can store private data encrypted with key that is not shared. If I check in my encrypted data into a public repo, everybody already has my data, just encrypted. If my key some time gets out in the wild, all private data is exposed.
Instead I'd rather have a specifc config file that is in gitignore and maybe a python script to to fill this config file initially. The configuration does not need to contain domains or ports, only passwords, and if configurable, usernames. People would be responsible on their own to back up this file.

164,2014-07-14 15:48:36,"I'd suggest an approach that goes a lot further, that of splitting out personal configuration from sovereign altogether. It's an approach I've taken in the ansible role library I'm developing called [lowar](https://github.com/adrinux/Lowar) – (similar approach to sovereign, different end result – its only for hosting web sites). Looking at the lowar 'skeleton' folder should give you some idea of how this works.

The approach depends on the ansible configuration variable ['roles_path'](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_configuration.html#roles-path) introduced in ansible 1.4, which allows you to point ansible to a folder of roles. You'd still want to supply an example set of configuration files with sovereign, but those would be copied out of the repo and modified to the users needs. At which point the user can do whatever they're comfortable with – no version control, private repo etc.

This has an additional benefit of not having to be careful to exclude personal config when submitting pull requests etc to Sovereign and a lot less jumping about between git branches.

I'm still at the point of setting up sovereign the first time, but I'm trying to set it up using this approach and will be submitting pull requests where required to make this possible.

2. You manually specify the configuration on the command line via `ansible-playbook -e@myvars.yml`

If it listens to the internet, the password must be configurable. right now the password is hard coded and this is not good.
Even if the password is hardcoded, exposing the monit service to the outside world should only be an option, imho deactivated by default.
Do you know that you could also access the monit web service by creating a port forward via ssh?
Here is how:

ssh  deploy@YOURSERVER  -L 2812:localhost:2812

I have had this issue on different virtual servers already. This time on the stratoserver where I intend to install sovereign.
The ufw enable action sometimes throws an error on ufw-init.
Whenever the firewall is enabled, dns lookups fail, even though port 53 is open for both udp and tcp. It seems to be a problem with conntrack and the disability to load the module. Related bug report:
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ufw/+bug/713788

Please consider how to make it easy for servers to migrate to this once we merge. It’s probably as simple as adding a task that _uninstalls_ ufw (and its associated configuration).

Also consider a modular configuration approach. It would be nice if each sovereign role was somehow responsible for enabling the ports it requires. That way, someone who comments out the XMPP role wouldn’t also have to plug the hole in the firewall.

FWIW, we originally used ferm, but accepted a patch to switch to ufw because it seemed simpler, more popular with people coming from Ubuntu, and would allow modular configuration. Did you consider switching back to ferm instead of introducing a third option? I don’t have an opinion either way — just curious.

147,2014-01-27 18:16:29,"The problem is with some vservers and the kernels used there. With ufw ansible cant be used with a firewall with these vservers.

This sounds serious but maybe it isnt all that much, because vservers can make trouble in other ways. Right now encfs does not work on digitalocean, and while the setup of vpn did not give errors on my stratoserver, I remember from some time ago that there were problems with tun or tap devices on these servers.

So maybe using a real server might be the right solution, I dont know.

Regarding the configurable firewall, I think that shorewall can work with config directories, then each service could register itself a rule file.

Digitalocean provides you with their own kernel, regardless of what you have installed in the VM. That means that if you upgrade your kernel (with `apt-get upgrade`, for example) then your package manager will think you have the new kernel, but you won't actually be able to run it.

My solution is to downgrade the kernel package to the version that they're actually providing, and pinning it. That ensures that all other packages that get installed will be compatible.

First, downgrade:

Then, pin it:

I had hoped that the virtual machine could also be used for local testing of the configurations and then deployment to the remote machines in the case of sovereign or my other project that was meant to marry the two.

After trying a few commercial offerings I am now running [BitTorrent Sync](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync) and it works great. I'm assuming y'all know this. I love that nobody has to register anywhere; just use the secret key and the files start syncing. So it works, it's encrypted, fast and free.

I am running this on my Ubuntu machine as follows:

Read [this blog post](http://forum.bittorrent.com/topic/18974-debian-and-ubuntu-server-packages-for-bittorrent-sync-121-1/) and added the PPA:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The setup was interactive, but I'm pretty sure it can be scripted. Accepted all the defaults, which means a btsync process running on some port (I chose 21992 based on some comment). It also wants to run a configuration web server, ran that at 8888 (the default).

After opening those two in ufw, and adding a folder in the web gui, things started syncing just fine. I chose `/decrypted/btsync` as my base folder and added folders to-be-synced below that.

Does this sound like something we'd want?

If yes are the PPAs okay or do we run btsync directly. The latter seems simpler to me, it's just a download, unpack and running a daemon.

Not sure about the web gui, it seems like a risk to me. I couldn't find anything about scripting folders to-be-synced though. It seems you'd need the gui just for that.

139,2014-01-17 01:42:20,"Unfortunately there isn’t. Doing so requires the key to be stored persistently (most likely on disk) which defeats the purpose of encfs entirely. If your server restarts, you must re-run the playbooks on it, and that should mount the encfs volume.

It is debatable how much security encfs provides when running on a VPS anyway. It is probably quite easy for the VM host to memory-scrape the key. At best, it prevents the casual snooper from trivially mounting the disk image (or snapshot) of our VM.

If you would like to disable encfs altogether, have a look at #120.

With that said, I think self-signed certificates shouldn't be encouraged. Browser handling of self-signed certificates ranges from ""poor"" to ""silently terrible"" - not to mention that iOS's native HTTP methods tend to choke on self-signed in ways the user can't resolve. Especially given that one of the goals of Sovereign is to improve personal security - adding self-signed certs, and encouraging users to ignore the (many) self-signed warnings, feels counterproductive to me.

Also, if you’re using self-signed certs, you may want to consider #111. If your cert supports `Subject Alternative Name` for both example.com and *.example.com, you can then easily add your cert as a trusted CA on clients, and it will work for all subdomains.

Doing it on the server has the bonus that everything can be completely automated.

Sovereign is gaining new functionality at a good rate, and we really need a better way for users to pick and choose the functionality they want. Right now this is accomplished by commenting out roles, but Galaxy is a prettier solution.

As @lukecyca says I've been investigating how to 'Dockerise' Sovereign. This is currently a work in progress (see #99). The plan is to host Docker images for components of Sovereign on a Docker registry. These will be updated when application updates are available and can then be pulled by each Sovereign server. Ansible will still be an important part of this process but the roles will  be much simpler as most of the configuration will then be in Docker containers.

It would be possible to put the relevant roles on Galaxy but I'm not sure if these would be that useful to other Galaxy users?

With regard to making it easy for Sovereign users to choose which applications to install, I'm currently of the opinion that commenting out roles is a reasonable approach given the target demographic of Sovereign.

Basically users would be writing their own playbooks, and could mix and

Basically it expands reach so the content can be used without having to

The whole point of projects like Sovereign is that you _don't_ have to do that, it's a library of roles _and_ associated plays. A bit of setup, tweak a few variables, run the play. Done. Skip the hunting down suitable roles in Galaxy entirely.

I also think commenting or uncommenting roles in plays is a perfectly suitable way to go – most config files on unix based systems already work like that ;)

I'm inclined to agree with @adrinux. For better or worse, the components of Sovereign are fairly coupled.

108,2013-12-19 02:26:34,"This pull request adds Z-Push to allow for mobile push notifications via ActiveSync/Exchange (something I really wanted). Before this I was using d-push successfully for about 20 days or so. However, the Debian 7 d-push is a bit behind Z-Push and doesn't allow syncing HTML email (thus, all mobile emails were in plain text). So instead I switch to z-push and not only is it faster, but now pushed emails are in HTML.

The only major limitation of z-push (and d-push) is that you cannot have multiple accounts syncing on the same device to a single server. It looks like this is/was in the plans to be able to support but has not, yet, been implemented. Of course, you can still have unlimited accounts configured the normal IMAP way on a single device.

This is using the latest release of z-push (version 2.1.1-1788) which was released on November 30th.

I’m not sure why the tests would have failed for you. What version of OpenSSL and Python do you have on your machine (the machine running the tests).

I wasn’t aware of [duraconf](https://github.com/ioerror/duraconf) — good find. I want to be very sure of these new settings before merging. I think we want to continue to accept mail from all servers, regardless of what ciphers they support or even whether they support TLS at all. I think it would be acceptable to require high-security ciphers, as long as we gracefully fall back to unencrypted for servers that fail to negotiate one.

Are you using this on your own mail server already? What kinds of ciphers have you seen negotiated with other mail servers?

106,2013-12-30 00:13:34,"That’s our problem. You are using OpenSSL 1.0.1e and I am using 0.9.8y which is what comes standard with OS X Mavericks.

So nothing changed in Sovereign, just in the client from which the tests are run.

Let’s change the assert to look for `DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA (256/256 bits)` and then they’ll both match. In retrospect this assertion is quite brittle because it depends on what is negotiated by the client, but I think this solution will be effective for now.

105,2013-12-17 20:37:09,"Thanks for reporting this, @catern.

Did you run it all at once? Or did you by chance do it in batches (interrupting and restarting it)?

I ask because the [task that copies the import.sql into place](https://github.com/al3x/sovereign/blob/master/roles/mailserver/tasks/postfix.yml#L20) notifies a handler to run the import. If you interrupt the playbook before that handler runs, it won’t import. Worse, the task won’t notify the handler on subsequent runs of the playbook because the import.sql file already be there.

You could test this by deleting `/etc/postfix/import.sql` on your server, and re-running the playbook. You should see it copy the file over again _and_ import it a little later in the playbook.

Assuming that’s the case, we could improve this by forcing the handler to run right after the copy.

However, the playbook did fail and halt at starting ufw. I restarted it immediately after and it ran normally from that point. (I think this was not an issue with sovereign but my VPS). I suppose this wouldn't have an effect since the mailserver tasks would run after the common tasks.

If the import is done by a handler which can be prevented from being run by a failure in other parts of sovereign, that's not very fault tolerant. Perhaps on every run a task could check if the relevant tables are present, and trigger the handler to perform the import if they are not.

I believe that’s just how Ansible works. The best we can do is [flush the handlers](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/playbooks.html#id12) immediately after this task so that it runs right away. The reason it’s a handler and not a task is so that it only runs if the `import.sql` file has actually changed.

A far simpler solution may be to use postfix flat files instead of a MySQL database.

I'm not sure I understand the point of encfs, or perhaps how it is implemented:

If the machine is considered trusted, then what's the point of encryption (not considering possible loss here like a laptop because it is always remote anyway)?

If the machine is not trusted, it cannot be allowed access to the decryption key, and thus cannot decrypt email, etc.

Is everything here done in-browser/mail client on the fly? I guess not, since I don't know whether such technology exists today, and even so, it probably wouldn't be compatible with search...

Instead, they would need to attack our running system, which is certainly possible but much more difficult.

66,2013-10-09 01:50:44,"- OpenVPN setup is now fully automated. No configuration changes are necessary (though the defaults can easily be modified) and all manual command line steps have been eliminated.
- Removed the dependency on easy-rsa in favor of pure OpenSSL and OpenVPN commands that are executed by Ansible
- Improved the security of the OpenVPN configuration
  - Increased the default key size to 2048
  - RSA keys are only readable by root
  - The cipher and authentication digest are now configurable. If your client supports it, you can use AES-256-CBC and SHA256 instead of BF-CBC (Blowfish) and SHA1 which are the defaults. Or you can be a really cool, paranoid, crypto hipster and use CAMELLIA-256-CBC and SHA512 with an RSA key size of 4096.
  - Enabled ""HMAC firewall"" functionality using the tls-auth option and automated the generation of the 'ta' key that it depends on
  - The OpenVPN daemon becomes an unprivileged user after it starts
- Automated the retrieval of the files that clients will need in order to connect to OpenVPN
- A pause prompt outputs basic configuration information after the role has finished running
- Variables are referenced using the new Ansible variable format (e.g. {{ var }} instead of $var)
- Added a flush_handlers command to the role that ensures OpenVPN will restart prior to dnsmasq (fixes issue #63)
- Fixed two bugs that were preventing packet forwarding for IPv4 from being enabled correctly

Have a look at my ansible repo (https://github.com/pjan/the-ansibles). It includes an extensive/configurable nginx role (add and delete modules, ...).

One thing to bear in mind, is that switching to nginx somehow will complicate the owncloud setup, but nothing that can't be done

BTW: Based on the many roles I already had, I took your sovereign for a twist (https://github.com/pjan/the-ansibles/blob/master/docs/cloudbox.md) and believe it's a bit more fool-proof / easier to start off with for the general crowd (owncloud is however not included).

Try setting the key to only be readable by root (mode 600). It could be that postfix is refusing to use the key because the permissions are set insecurely.

Also make sure the key is in PEM format and isn't encrypted (ie: isn't password-protected).

Certificates are the same for dovecot and postfix and they work for dovecot (moreover I used them in my previous installation and it worked very well at this time). So I think that they are in the good format and accessible. But I want to check them.

How can I check that they are not password-protected (for me they are not but who knows). When I ask openssl to check the key it doesn't ask for password. Is it sufficient ?

31,2013-09-22 04:28:51,"The `*_CAfile` parameters are not quite right after this change. I've studied the postfix docs some more ([this page](http://www.postfix.org/TLS_README.html) is especially detailed) and here are the relevant parts:

### [smtp_tls_CAfile](http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtp_tls_CAfile)

> A file containing CA certificates of root CAs trusted to sign either remote SMTP server certificates or intermediate CA certificates.

In other words, this is the set of all the CAs in the world from which our server will recognize certificates. When our server tries to send email to gmail.com, gmail's smtpd will present a cert signed by GeoTrust. Unless we have GeoTrust in our list of recognized CAs, we won't be able to validate gmail's cert.
This should be set to `smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`

### [smtpd_tls_CAfile](http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_CAfile)

> A file containing (PEM format) CA certificates of root CAs trusted to sign either remote SMTP client certificates or intermediate CA certificates.

This is similar to above, but since it's for `smtpd`, it is used to validate client certs from clients connecting to our smtpd server.

> By default (see smtpd_tls_ask_ccert), client certificates are not requested, and smtpd_tls_CAfile should remain empty.

Since we are not using client certs in this configuration, we have no use for this line.

### [smtpd_tls_cert_file](http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#smtpd_tls_CAfile)

This is correct after @bcachet's fix, however...

> To enable a remote SMTP client to verify the Postfix SMTP server certificate, the issuing CA certificates must be made available to the client. You should include the required certificates in the server certificate file, the server certificate first, then the issuing CA(s) (bottom-up order).

So this should actually be our cert, followed by the rest of the cert chain. Otherwise, you'll notice you get `Verify return code: 21 (unable to verify the first certificate)` when you test with `openssl s_client -connect mail.example.com:465`.

I have (erroneously) made my `/etc/ssl/certs/wildcard_ca.pem` be the whole chain (since there was multiple TODO placeholders in there), which is why this was working for me.

1) back up encrypted-mail, not decrypted-mail

Pros:
- Defends against any theoretical weakness in tarsnap

Cons:
- Encrypted data doesn't deduplicate as well.
- Attacker still gains access to all backups, possibly useful for an attack.

2) move key to /decrypted-mail
Pros:
- Key is never unencrypted-at-rest on the drive

Class 1 certificates needed 1 IP per 1 host name ( the full one subdomain.domain.com) right?

The answer to your question, kind of, is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication - TL;DR extension to TLS, supported since 2007, allows for virtual domains to have independent SSL certificates.

Combine this with multiple free StartSSL Class 1 certificates (actually they might be class 2 - they all include ""X.domain.com"" and ""domain.com"", so that's two SSL domains) and you can avoid using a wildcard cert.

For each VirtualHost directive, add a set of SSL directives that point to the specific key, cert, and chain for the individual certificates.
