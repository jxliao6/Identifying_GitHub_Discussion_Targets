* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
bug


* **What is the current behavior?**
I cant load sass files both for component style and the global style.
the component's style:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
global style: (imported inside app.component.ts)
`import '../assets/sass/styles.scss';`

i have found this rule for loading component sass styles and it works, but only for component's style:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
also i've found this rule which can load the global sass file (the import statement), but doesn't load the component style:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

also, when i put both of them inside the rules array, i get this error:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

ofcourse i can work around it by specifying the regex parts inside rules like this, and it works:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

but it's not a good way at all.(considering the fixed file names)

so, what should i do?



* **Please tell us about your environment:**

- Angular version: 2.4.5
- npm version: 3.10.10

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of string-replace-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ts-node.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of zone.js.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Getting an error below.

**Not working:**

let xxx = ""./+detail#DetailModule"";

loadChildren should accept the variable and lazy module should work.

1631,2017-03-24 17:03:21,"This is most likely an issue with ng-router-loader, my guess is that it will not work since that loader looks at the router module file as a string so that it can find and replace the loadChildren property with  webpack friendly code. 

[if you look at this code](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ng-router-loader/blob/master/src/builtin_codegens.ts) you can see what the loader replaces your config with so it works with webpack. i guess if you use this code snippet instead of the loader you can make it work as desired.

 `loadChildren: function() { return new Promise(function (resolve) {`,
    `  require.ensure([], function (require) {`,
    `    resolve(${requireString});`,
    `  }${webpackChunkName});`,

I want to report a bug.

* **What is the current behavior?**

Cloning on a mac, everything like described, all the npm scripts work beside tests: The current e2e tests do not compile. 

npm run test / npm run e2e / npm run ci

I assume it will be the same for everyone, I started over again for double checking.

e2e tests should compile and work out of the box if this is a starter template.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

1621,2017-03-15 18:43:47,"Hello!

I am using a older version of angular2-webpack. I cant tell wich Version... Because in this version i downloadet is no where a version number in the readme file... But it must be about 1 year old.

# Here the Readme File:

# angular2-webpack

[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/preboot/angular2-webpack/status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/preboot/angular2-webpack#info=dependencies) [![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/preboot/angular2-webpack/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/preboot/angular2-webpack#info=devDependencies)

**Note: This guide is following the Angular's [Style Guide](http://angular.io/styleguide) so I will be changing conventions here and there eventually. You are free to use your own conventions with this starter.**
**Note 2: There is no conventions yet for RC5 on the style guide so there will be a future update here for that.**

A complete, yet simple, starter for Angular 2 using Webpack.

This seed repo serves as an Angular 2 starter for anyone looking to get up and running with Angular 2 and TypeScript fast. Using [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) for building our files and assisting with boilerplate. We're also using Protractor for our end-to-end story and Karma for our unit tests.
* Best practices in file and application organization for [Angular 2](https://angular.io/).
* Ready to go build system using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/) for working with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).
* Testing Angular 2 code with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/).
* Coverage with [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)
* End-to-end Angular 2 code using [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/).
* Stylesheets with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (not required, it supports regular css too).
* Error reported with [TSLint](http://palantir.github.io/tslint/) and [Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer).
* Documentation with [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.io/).

>Warning: Make sure you're using the latest version of Node.js and NPM

[Is Angular 2 Ready Yet?](http://splintercode.github.io/is-angular-2-ready/)

### Quick start

> Clone/Download the repo then edit `app.ts` inside [`/src/app/app.component.ts`](/src/app/app.component.ts)

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

# Getting Started

## Dependencies

What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (Use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* Ensure you're running Node (`v5.x.x`+) and NPM (`3.x.x`+)

## Installing

* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Developing

After you have installed all dependencies you can now start developing with:

* `npm start`

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The application can be checked at `http://localhost:8080`.

As an alternative, you can work using Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

* `npm run start:hmr`

And you are all set! You can now modify your components on the fly without having to reload the entire page.

## Testing

#### 1. Unit Tests

* single run: `npm test`
* live mode (TDD style): `npm run test-watch`

#### 2. End-to-End Tests (aka. e2e, integration)

* single run:
  * in a tab, *if not already running!*: `npm start`
  * in a new tab: `npm run webdriver-start`
  * in another new tab: `npm run e2e`
* interactive mode:
  * instead of the last command above, you can run: `npm run e2e-live`
  * when debugging or first writing test suites, you may find it helpful to try out Protractor commands without starting up the entire test suite. You can do this with the element explorer.
  * you can learn more about [Protractor Interactive Mode here](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#testing-out-protractor-interactively)

## Production

To build your application, run:

* `npm run build`

You can now go to `/dist` and deploy that to your server!

## Documentation

You can generate api docs (using [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.io/)) for your code with the following:

* `npm run docs`

# FAQ

#### Do I need to add script / link tags into index.html ?

No, Webpack will add all the needed Javascript bundles as script tags and all the CSS files as link tags. The advantage is that you don't need to modify the index.html every time you build your solution to update the hashes.

#### How to include external angular 2 libraries ?

It's simple, just install the lib via npm and import it in your code when you need it. Don't forget that you need to configure some external libs in the [bootstrap](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack/blob/master/src/main.ts) of your application.

#### How to include external css files such as bootstrap.css ?

Just install the lib and import the css files in [vendor.ts](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack/blob/master/src/vendor.ts). For example this is how to do it with bootstrap:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And in [vendor.ts](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack/blob/master/src/vendor.ts) add the following:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

# TypeScript

> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor

We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 11+](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of karma-webpack.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of zone.js.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

* **What is the current behavior?**
When I attempt to plug in internet explorer into the protractor config, I get

I was hoping a protractor config with IE support could be added to the repo or pasted here. If there's anything I'm missing, some guidance would also be much appreciated.

As a developer, I would like to run end to end tests against Internet Explorer so that I can make sure the website is fully functional on IE

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of css-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

[x] bug report
[ ] feature request
[ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

* **What is the current behavior?**
AOT build inludes every component template two times making the bundle much bigger than needed as templates are included as strings which cannot be minified by UglifyJS.

* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** 

In freshly cloned repo
`npm i`
`npm run build:aot:prod`
`grep -o ""WebPack Angular 2 Starter by"" dist/main.*.js`
returns 2 lines matching:
one in ngc compiled component code (`this._text_30=this.renderer.createText(this._el_29,""WebPack Angular 2 Starter by "",null),this._el_31=s.createRenderElement(`)
other in bundled template (`\n\n    <footer>\n      <span>WebPack Angular 2 Starter by <a [href]=""url"">@AngularClass</a></span>\n `)


* **What is the expected behavior?**
Component templates are not included as strings. They are already handled by ngc and built into compiled components

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of source-map-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of tslint.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

[X] bug report
[ ] feature request
[ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

Starting from a pristine install, I had to make a couple of modifications before I was able to successfully build and serve for production. 

------------

First, I noticed that `webpack-dev-server.js` was being included in `index.html` regardless of NODE_ENV. 

To fix this, I changed:

`src/index.html` L56
from `<% if (webpackConfig.metadata.ENV === 'development') { %>`
to      `<% if (process.env.ENV === 'development') { %>`

---------------

Next, I was having trouble getting my styles included with an `EXCEPTION: Failed to load %5Bobject%20Object%5D` error as seen in [this SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38102760/getting-failed-to-load-5bobject20object5d-on-webpack-generated-js-hosted-in-e)

For this, I changed:

`src/app/app.component.ts` L47
from `styleUrls: [require('!style!css!sass!../sass/main.scss')],`
to `styles: String[require('!style!css!sass!../sass/main.scss')],`

* **Please tell us about your environment:**

- Angular version: 2.0.0-beta.X
- Browser: [all /Chrome/Firefox ]
- Node 7

Feature
Help it easier to add new variables in code and different environments, make use of the webpack DefinePlugin


* **What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)
Consider my case: 
When I want to add a new config, like `Google Analytics token`, they should be different in development/test/production mode. (I think it would be better to add it into DefinePlugin)
So first I add `GA_TOKEN` to each `webpack.*.js`'s DefinePlugin: 
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And then add it into `custom-typings.d.ts`:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Finally, I can use the GA_TOKEN in my ts code, like the ENV variable which already defined and declared.

When my settings getting growth, like `PAYMENT_TOKEN`, `BACKEND_SERVER`, thus coding style gets explosion.

* **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**

Just simply define a GA_TOKEN in the config/vars/development.js and config/vars/prod.js, and easily use `VARS.GA_TOKEN` in your ts code.
No other configs need to be changed.

While export all the config out into a single file, it would make it easier to be encrypt and generated

Hello, I have just updated to Angular 4 RC1 and Typescript 2.2 and have been getting a weird error and some unresolved variables. I'm getting a `cannot read property 'probe' of undefined` in the console, which I think is coming from this piece of code: 
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
Also my IDE is complaining a lot about unresolved variables, do you have any idea why is this happening? Should I revert to a previous version?

`enableDebugTools(cmpRef);`

`let _ng = (<any> window).ng;`

you can bypass the error, but the probe and coreTokens wouldn't have been set properly which will disable some  debugging functions such as Augury.

It happens because window.ng comes with an undefined probe property after the 4.rc.1 update... But I couldn't come up with a fix at this time unfortunately...",kemalcany,

I've built a project on top of your seed, and I keep updated it.
Most of the config (and the environment) are the same, with small tweaks.

When updating to ver 5.4.1 (current ver), The repo works just fine.
But after updating my project, I rn npm run server and I get this error :  
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I noticed that at the AngularClass project, at ./dll/ there is a vendor.dll.js, and **vendor.dll.js.map**

But in my project, **there is only vendor.dll.js**.

What I need to do so it will create the .map file?  I tried to investigate it but couldn't find out why I can't get to work.
(All dependencies in package.json are the same version as the the AngularClass project, node and npm version can't be the problem because it's already working in the original project).

I've created a folder called `files` in the app directory as bellow :

And here is inside both those services : 


`SHOULD_BE_SHAKEN.ts`

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And then I'm running `npm run build:prod or build:aot:prod` expecting not to find the `SHOULD_BE_SHAKEN` and `SHOULD_BE_SHAKEN2` inside the `main bundle` , but as you can see both of them ended up there :

Don't know if it was just for me, but following ""How to use Bootstrap 3 and Sass and ng2 bootstrap"" wiki page caused bootstrap glyphicon to not load on aot production build.

Managed to fix my issue by including 
$icon-font-path: '~bootstrap-sass/assets/fonts/bootstrap/';
@import '~bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap';

to 'src/styles/style.scss' instead of 'src/app/app.component.scss' as wiki suggest.

Thought I share my experience if anyone comes into the same issue.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of typescript.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of rxjs.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

2. Added npm script: `""copy:fa:fonts"": ""copyfiles -f node_modules/font-awesome/fonts/* src/fonts"",`

Hi,

I've tried to access the angularclass.com support links to make sure before i post this one if this is a bug or not but with no success.

I wonder why when i clone this repository and do npm intall and then when i try to inject any simple service 
into the home or about component I get this error 
""

[at-loader] compiled\src\app\home\home.component.ngfactory.ts:36:20
    TS2346: Supplied parameters do not match any signature of call target.
""

here is my test.service.ts file 
""
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class Test {
    constructor() {

    }
}
""
this is the home.component.ts modification i make
import { Test } from '../services/test.service';

  providers: [    
    AppState,
    Title,
    Test
  ],

  // TypeScript public modifiers
  constructor(     
    public appState: AppState,    
    public title: Title,
    private test:Test
  ) {}
""
and simply i cannot get away from the error I'm getting.

when i take a look at the compiled\src\app\home\home.component.ngfactory.ts:36:20 file
i see this :
""
  constructor(p0:any,p1:any) {
    this._changed = false;
    this.context = new import0.HomeComponent(p0,p1);

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-dev-server.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Hi! When I am running `npm start` it doesn't check for linting files like  `.json.ts` (unexpected)  and `.spec.ts (expected)`. The excluded spec files are expected, since in the configuration you have `exclude: [/\.(spec|e2e)\.ts$/]`. If I do `npm run lint` I get linting for those as well. If I remove  `exclude: [/\.(spec|e2e)\.ts$/]` from the configuration it still excluded .spec.ts and .json.ts so this might be a tslint-loader bug..

* **What is the current behavior?**

while the configuration only exludes .spec.ts files and e2e.spec files it is still skipping .json.ts files.

* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).

* **What is the expected behavior?**

it should check for linting `.json.ts` files

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

it doesn't make since when something is not excluded to be excluded

* **Please tell us about your environment:**

- Angular version: 2.4.6

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As typedoc is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

[ x ] question 

Hello, 
Because cannot use support channels (slack throws an error when I am trying to get the Invite to enter AngularClass chat)  I am typing here.

I've cloned your latest sources from github and tried to build my application with it. But I got a problem, In the production build an error is thrown: 
`Cannot read property 'call' of undefined`. And that happens when I am including in `vendor.ts` these files:
`
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
import 'font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css';
import 'toastr/build/toastr.css';
import 'fullcalendar/dist/fullcalendar.css';
import 'fullcalendar-scheduler/dist/scheduler.css';
`
In dev build everything is OK. 

Do you have any suggestion for that please? 
Thanks!
I am sorry if my question is annoying for you. I hope it can be solved somehow. 

With a previous version of angular2-webpack-starter (version from January 2017 (from 1st to 25th Jan) Everything went ok.

I use the latest angular2-webpack-starter

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of zone.js.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of sass-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**

It's a question

* **What is the current behavior?**

I just finished updating to aot and my code seems to works fine with npm run build:aot.
But I'm not sure I'm doing this right since the generated file is 3MB larger than the one generated with npm run build:prod ( so jit only )

Two questions then, is that normal ( and if not how can I reduce this size ) ? And do I have a way of knowing if i'm running the aot version ?

The steps I'm using : 

npm run build:aot:prod
npm run server:prod
 => File size is 5mo

npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod
 => File size is 1mo

Thanks

Latest repo version, running `npm run build:aot:prod`:  
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5377501/22889574/4f6bb778-f212-11e6-90a6-f545aeb17416.png)

**Total folder size: 1.3M**

You might notice that the `main` file and `chunk` files are larger in `build:prod:aot` then in `build:prod`, this is perfectly normal since AOT produces more code.

The total amount is less in AOT since the compiler is not part of the bundle, you can see it in the size of the `vendor` bundle.

This also means that as your application grow, AOT will yield larger code since you add more AOT generated code but the compiler size is constant.

The angular team is working on reducing the emitted code, one of the upcoming feature for this is a new [View Engine](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/14013) that will reduce bundle size but will slightly effect performance (it's always a tradeoff)

I see no issue here, try to start from scratch, you probably changed something",shlomiassaf,2017-02-13 15:41:30

Feature about the Webpack configuration

* **What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)

The Webpack configuration it's called individually for all the run. This is somehow explicit about the configuration, but it is not good for extends. 

* **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**

This PR should introduce a new structure for the Webpack configuration folders. This should be easy to understand, and to extend. The webpack should be called without any config argument, and the main Webpack config file should call the Webpack config folder. This `index.js` should be able to resolve the request configuration and return it. 

* **Other information**:

  - It should work now for common browsers build. 
  - Github deploy still WIP. 
  - This code needs Node 6 to run (Destructive imports, parameters initialization). But as it's being discussed here (#1368) Node 5 it's not supported by Angular 2, so, effectively this doesn't support anything below Node 6 LTS either.

* **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**

This PR should introduce a new structure for the Webpack configuration folders. This should be easy to understand, and to extend. The webpack should be called without any config argument, and the main Webpack config file should call the Webpack config folder. This `index.js` should be able to resolve the request configuration and return it. 

* **Other information**:

Right now it's a WIP (The build shows errors somehow).

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of istanbul-instrumenter-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

[x] bug report
[ ] feature request
[ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
I am reporting bug.

* **What is the current behavior?**
Metadata from another environment can't be accessed inside index.html.

* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via

1. Clone repository
2. Inside webpack.dev.js add key to METADATA section, for example:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
3. Inside index.html replace
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
with
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
4. run `npm start` - it should use dev environment

As you can see only isDevServer is displayed as true.  If you add MYKEY inside `webpack.common.js` it works fine but you are limited to one config per project.

Also following statement is always false because HMR is placed inside webpack.dev.ts that cannot be referenced here

<S_CODE_TOKEN>


* **What is the expected behavior?**
It should use metadata values from proper environment.

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
Providing different API keys across different environments inside index.html


* **Please tell us about your environment:**
`git clone https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter`

* **Other information** (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As typescript is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?

1499,2017-02-08 10:28:10,"NO_COVERAGE is provide for IDE integration

This PR enables proper breaking point in TS code.

Fixes #1392

Approach:
All configurations files (karma/webpack.test) are configured without coverage, if coverage support is needed it will be added into the config's.
This is common sense, there's no point in setting something then removing it which is also not clear and readable.

Coverage is opt-out, i.e. by default you will get coverage reports... the developer needs to opt out of coverage explicitly.

There are 2 ways to opt out:
  - Using `--watch-mode`. watch mode implies development session so no coverage there. This is automatically set as part of the npm scripts in this project.

  - Using `NO_COVERAGE` environment variable, when set the coverage will not run. This is a fallback that is useful for IDE integration where karama is executed and controlled by the IDE.

* **I'm submitting a ...**
[x] bug report
[ ] feature request
[ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
I'm not sure whether that means a bug or feature, but when I'm trying to brush my code with prefixes, its behavior seemed be wrong, or I'm doing wrong. 


* **What is the current behavior?**
While I import scss file directly at app.component.ts '../styles/styles.scss';  they were not added with prefixes. But using another your example with adding scss file directly at App Component with 
styleUrls: [ './app.component.scss' ], it become prefixable


* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
here part of my app.component.ts:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
here webpack.common.js:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>



* **What is the expected behavior?**
I'm using your example with bootstrap 4 and expected to see not only vanilla css styling, I prefer use it with autoprefixer, which configured with postcss.config.js file and it works correct.


* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
compatibility of old versioned browsers


* **Please tell us about your environment:**

""@angular/common"": ""~2.4.3"",
""webpack"": ""2.2.0"",
""autoprefixer"": ""^6.7.2"",
""postcss-loader"": ""^1.2.2"",

1493,2017-02-23 18:24:59,"@Mentor-kh i had the same problem. 

i fix this with the following steps 

1. follow the steps from https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer
2. add postcss-loader to the scss settings in webpack.common.js and webpack.dev.js
3. add autoprefixer browser setting in postcss.config.js

1491,2017-02-11 01:01:04,"My explanation (mostly guess) is follow. Please correct me if anything is incorrect.

'npm' is in fact the shortcut for 'node npm-cli.js'. Basically when we run 'node something.js', the content of something.js will be put into a js function (with environmental parameters) and run.

In our case, 'webpack' and 'webpack.cmd' are in fact OS batch files, so when put into a js function, it is obviously an error; and 'node webpack.js' works.

Note: I am using Node 7.5",pilgylis,
1491,2017-02-12 01:42:20,"@pilgylis yep, I do understand why `node notnodeprogram.cmd` doesn't work. I'm just thinking if there would be some better way to pass the memory limit parameter than calling node directly from package.json (for example in some debian based machines doesn't have `node` executable but its called `nodejs` so there is a little crossplatform compatibility issue in there too...). 

Btw. I'm not sure if I understood correctly what you meant with the comment how `npm` runs the scripts declared in package.json, but I'm sure it doesn't wrap those scripts to any js function, but just directly executes them in a new process with some additional environment variables given. I haven't checked the code, but I suppose it just calls `spawn` or `exec` to run them.",elhigu,

But this file is not present in the project until you compile it using ngc. And even if you compile it, what to do with other people having this error? They can run same command, but this is not an option. Another option is to commit these files, but its also bad idea. Having always the error that this file is missing absolutely not an option.

AFAIK angular-cli does not require you to create this file and handles aot specifics by its own.",pleerock,2017-02-07 11:20:16
1490,2017-02-07 11:18:57,"@pleerock This file belongs to the project, no issue with it.

`angular-cli` creates this file at webpack runtime, but in the same time has a lot of other ""enforcements"", like having to use it's internal TS loader and other stuff.

There is no issue with this file in the project since it is not an entry point when not in AOT mode hence it's there but not used.

When this file is used, it is in AOT mode which means that the AOT compiler just finished running so the file is referencing an existing file.

The error people get is because the `awesome-typescript-loader` type checker does not care about the entry point, it parses the whole library so people get errors but they are virtual.

The error should be fixed soon once s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader#364 is set which is the direct cause of the problem

When I say

I mean that the way you use it is not the way it is intended to be used.

`tsc` is a command line tool based on a static JSON file, if you want multiple configurations you need multiple files.

This repository is based on webpack, not `tsc`, we use webpack tools to dynamically control the tool chain. We don't exclude `main.browser.aot.ts` in our **tsconfig** because we relay on webpack **entryPoint** for that.

You are trying to use one of the tools in the toolchain without providing the proper environment to it, which we do using webpack.

Anyway, I can't think of any use case to run `tsc` outside of webpack, the output will not work even if no error.",shlomiassaf,2017-02-07 11:20:16

actually it will depend on use case if you configure it properly.

The problem is IDE compiler. IDE uses tsc to compile the code and it does not care about webpack. You'll have this error in IDE until you run webpack which will run ngc which will create ""compile"" directory with file required for compilation. Bad workflow.",pleerock,2017-02-07 11:20:16

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of protractor.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

loadChildren from Router seems to be broken with the new version of angular

(dunno if a bug from angular to from angular class ) The loadChildren doesn't work as well, the following code : 
`const clickRoutes: Routes = [
  { path : '', redirectTo: 'login', pathMatch: 'full' },
  { path: 'login' ,    component    : LoginComponent },  
  { path: 'home'      , loadChildren : './home/home.component#homeModule'  },
  { path: '**'    ,    component    : NoContentComponent },
]`

they gave me an error:

> 'app' is not a known element

the other routes seems to be working.

Reporting a Bug

Errors when using github-deploy

* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via


Clone the repository
install NPM packages with npm install
run `npm run github-deploy:prod`

(if you run github-deploy without prod flag, you get tslint-loader errors that I think are red-herrings for the real problem)

Errors will occur while compiling main and polyfills.
The errors indicate that a module is not found at node_modules/typescript/lib/package.json

* **What is the expected behavior?**
Github deploy should not error

it is a bug

<S_CODE_TOKEN>",DBosley,2017-02-09 17:01:21
1483,2017-02-07 22:38:10,"Not related to tslint

This is caused by the `gh-pages` packages that overrides (or one of the packages dependencies override) some functionality in the prototype of a core primitive (I think Array, not sure).

This causes an unexpected behaviour and `awesome-typescript-loader` get's unexpected results from an array function call.

The fix is simple, in `webpack.github-deploy.js` move:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

down just before the call that uses it

Test coverage doesn't show files for which specs are not written. When team members don't create specs for new files, it don't get caught in coverage report.

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As script-ext-html-webpack-plugin is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

* **What is the current behavior?**

The config folder has config files for every component in it. Also, some task in npm scripts are repetitive, and can be handle in a better way using webpack env argument. 

* **What is the wanted/proposed behavior?**

I fork this project to add some custom things, but in the way I manage to structure in a more scalable way (according to me). And I would like to propose that change in for the config folder in this project. I would made a pull request, but I want to know if this is something you would like. 

`config structure`

",michaeljota,
1468,2017-02-06 09:47:53,"I think some refactor should be done too:

# Rename webpack.*.ts files

Webpack should have 3 config files:

1. webpack.dev.js: development mode: no minimize files, create sourcemap...)
2. webpack.test.js: for unit testing
3. webpack.build.js: build aot or jit

The file webpack.common.js should be renamed too because it's not used in webpack.dev.js. It could be webpack.helpes.js or webpack.utils.js and it should have functions that could be used in the other config files to inject some plugin, config or whatever.

# Create real eviroment config files

The project should have different enviroment config files:

* config.dev.js
* config.pre.js
* config.pro.js
* config.github.js

In these files the user could set the API URL, the domain used, the color of the topbar or what they want.

DefinePlugin should add these config to use in .ts files. Something like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

# Create config.ts file

And the project should have one config.ts file. The user should not use `process.env`. A config.ts file that could be:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>",JoniJnm,
1468,2017-02-06 13:05:40,"I like your suggest about the management of the ENV variable. However, I think instead of using `process.env` it would be better to use Webpack own `env` variable. It's setteable alike, and I think it's better to understand. Also, you would not need to parse anything, cause Webpack can handle that itself. 

My current workflow works with the `env` variable.

`config/webpack/index.js`: Resolves the `target` for webpack build according to env variable.

1468,2017-02-06 13:16:38,"An structure like this, would also have some benefits over current implementation. See this function for example:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-dev-server.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

I do have Polymer elements working fine.

1. create a main-polymer.ts that contains: document.addEventListener('WebComponentsReady', () => {require('./main.browser.ts')});
2. your webpack.config.ts or webpack.common.ts may then contain:    entry: {

      'polyfills': './src/polyfills.browser.ts',
      'vendor':    './src/vendor.browser.ts',
      'main':      './src/main-polymer.ts'
    },

That's it.
Then you're sure that your polymer elements are loaded and working before your app get loaded.
I hop that's what you where looking for.

@ITServicesAM You are setting up the polyfil in https://github.com/ITServicesAM/angular_2_polymer/blob/master/src/main.browser.aot.ts which is for AOT only.

You should also set it here: https://github.com/ITServicesAM/angular_2_polymer/blob/master/src/main.browser.ts

Using `require` might lead to unexpected AOT compilation result, its not 100% but it's not a good practice anyway.

* **Bug report:**

When we try to insert AOT component to dynamic (JIT) component ViewChild in AOT is undefined. 

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20964736/22543682/ba9faf82-e942-11e6-9809-81c4e8b787e3.png)

* **Example:** 

Dynamic component: 
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
dynamic.component.html: 
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

AOT component: 
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

aot.component.html:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

GitHub demo: https://github.com/KhanaevRoman/Dynamic-components-with-AOT
Reproduce: 
  npm install
  npm run-script build:aot:prod
  npm run-script server:prod

* **Expected behavior:**

ViewChild shall contains ElementRef with nativeElement for DOM manipulation.

* **Motivation / use case for changing the behavior:**

Need possibility to use AOT components with dynamic (JIT) components.

* **Environment:**

- angular version: 2.4.3-2.4.5
- webpack version: 2.2.0
- ngc-webpack version (Windows x64): 1.1.1-1.1.4, 1.2.0 (1.1.0 works)
- ngc-webpack version (Mac OS, Linux): 1.1.0-1.2.0

- Browser: Chrome

1459,2017-02-02 11:16:32,"The JIT compiler is not present when you compile AOT, that's what compiling AOT means otherwise it was JIT, right?

JIT compiler is not included in the bundle when you AOT compile, in your case you included it since you created a hard reference but it was not properly set, you can't just use it you need to hook it up with angular, when you AOT compile its not hooked, when you JIT compile it is automatically hooked by angular.

if you want to do JIT compilation with AOT you need to instantiate the JIT compiler through DI (providers) 

This is how to do it with lazy loading the JIT compiler in a different lazy-loaded NgModule.
https://github.com/shlomiassaf/lazy-jit

The JIT compiler is quite big so this is why you will want it to lazy load.
On of the main reasons for AOT is not bundling the JIT compiler, its 60% of angular.

Everything you need is in the referenced repository, other then that it's a support issue which we kindly ask to forward to the relevant forums.",shlomiassaf,2017-02-02 11:16:32

Thanks for your fast answer and your good job.
Problem was with NgcWebpackPlugin in default webpack.common.js:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
After removing 'resourceOverride' dynamic creating work good with AOT compiling even with JitCompilerFactory.

As we understood this option do not remove from components source of HTML templates and JIT compiler can read and compile these templates.

So repeat. How is actually it works:
1. If components was compiled by AOT.
2. Some dynamic component wants to use one or more AOT components.
3. Shall JIT compiler recompile all component (templates, styles) used by dynamic component?
It means that we shall save all source html and styles after AOT compilation for JIT compiler.
Also we shall include JIT compiler to our project.
As result we will have: additional size of JIT compiler + all sources of components. 

Thanks a lot.",KhanaevRoman,2017-02-02 11:16:32

* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**

Both.

* **What is the current behavior?**

When ``compiled`` directory is empty or non-existing, running ``npm run build:dev`` results in an error from awesome-typescript-loader:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>



* **What is the expected behavior?**

Build should not produce errors even if ``compiled`` directory doesn't exist or is empty, since directory is not needed for a dev build without aot.


* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

Was able to work around this by:

in ``webpack.common.js``
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

in ``tsconfig.json``:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Then ``npm run build:dev`` finishes without errors. Still ``npm run build:prod`` causes the same error message.

I am currently having the same issue with this setup",mbenzenhoefer,
1458,2017-02-02 11:53:59,"This error is fired by the `CheckerPlugin` from `awesome-typescript-loader`

The checker plugin process all typescript files in the `src` directory while the `awesome-typescript-loader` process files that webpack provides starting from the root (entryPoint).

The end result is `src/main.browser.aot.ts` being process by the `CheckerPlugin` and if there is no content in the compile directory there is an error.

This is why we get a type error but not a bundling error, this is a ""virtual"" error that does not effect the end result, runtime will have no error.

The workaround is not a viable solution, the `tsconfig.json` is for the test environment and it will require syncing up both configs every time, if we need some changes to the test environment (and only test) we will face an issue.

There is a [PR proposal](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/pull/1378) that tried to make typescript config dynamic but it makes things a bit more complicated for the end developer.

The best solution is typescript to accepts commonJS modules instead of json file :)",shlomiassaf,
1458,2017-02-03 13:10:37,"Ok, I see. Looks like we're going with yet another ``tsconfig.*.json`` file that is going to be used for non-AoT builds ... maybe ``tsconfig.dev.json`` or ``tsconfig.jit.json`` ... do you think this is a useful thing to have in this starter repo?",dherges,

1458,2017-02-07 12:39:24,"@shlomiassaf I don't get it. Right now, we have two files in this repo:

``tsconfig.json`` for tests
``tsconfig.webpack.json`` for webpack build

my suggestion is to add another one:

``tsconfig.jit.json`` for JiT compiler builds

plus, we could rename ``tsconfig.webpack.json`` to ``tsconfig.aot.json`` to make it clear, that this one is used for AoT compiler builds.
",dherges,
1458,2017-02-07 13:21:56,"Did you look at s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader#364

Instead of complicating the build with another static JSON configuration file that issue offers dynamic control over the scope of the checker.

Now, it might seem simple enough to add another `tsconfig.jit.json` but the reality is that someone has to maintain it...

Every change made in one `tsconfig.XXX.json`has to be replicated into all other tsconfig files.

We already have hard time dealing with the different TEST environment setup and once in a while we discover that a feature that was added to one config was not added to another....

Not to mention we have multiple webpack configs and multiple tsconfig configs.

The goal is to consolidate the configuration and not spread it, so I don't think adding a new file is the right approach.

Again, s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader#364 offers a good solution, a little patience and we will fix this.

Of course, I'm not calling the shots, so please lets get input from @d3viant0ne @gdi2290 @colinskow 
 ",shlomiassaf,
1458,2017-02-07 15:05:13,"Thanks for your clarification. I understand your points.

At the same time, I like to see the resulting configuration. Having ""plain"" json files in the repository allows to quickly compare different tsconfigs. I fully agree that this spreads out configuration and makes it harder to maintain.

So, from my point of view, this is about maintainability vs. debuggability (does that word even exist?!?!): with dynamic config, I'd like to have some utility that prints the configuration. Maybe, I should reach out to s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader then 💯 ",dherges,
1458,2017-02-07 20:36:09,"@dherges The tradeoff is clear, the balance is not.

The current status is that:
  - AOT compilation in angular is not that trivial, lot's of factors people don't realise.
  - Running unit tests with Karma requires a completely unique configuration
 
Add to that HMR, unique loaders, special production settings, linting etc.. 
The end result is a complicated process, to complicated if you ask me.

I help a lot of friends with setups, its a real blocker for most and this is why the angular-cli is a must, and I hope it will allow the freedom we get here, one day.

To sum up, factoring all of the above I think we should avoid spreading as much as possible.

1458,2017-02-07 21:44:00,"This is also fixed by #1378, but s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader#364 will provide a better solution. We should wait to avoid over-complicating things.

**What is the current behavior?**
For now, the angular app refreshes every time a .scss or .css file is changed


**What is the expected behavior?**
Ideally, styles files are recompiled and inject into page without refreshing the page 


**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
Because for now, every page fresh takes me at least **5 seconds**, and gets longer as the app grows. 

I am writing a lot of scss styles for my angular2 app, I used to use GulpJS, which inject the new compiled css into the page in real time, done in **1 second** (There's no page refreshes). However for now I have to wait for at least **5 seconds** (page refreshes) every time I save my scss files.

when you used Gulp I imagine you didn't do it on Angular 2 right? so instead of blaming webpack try to understand the environment :)

CSS in angular `@Component`s are not part of the global CSS you used to have in Gulp and that was loaded via a HTML link tag.

CSS that you attach to components is part of the bundle, if you refresh CSS the whole ngModule must refresh.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of protractor.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of rxjs.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Failure is due to #1382, once we merge and rebase it should be fine (node 5)

Main changes for this version is support for `file-loader` and additional assets created by loaders (urls in css, html etc) 

This will solve  #1406 and #1428

    ..src/frontend/...
    ..src/frontend/src/...
    ..src/frontend/config/webpack.common.js
    ..src/shared/src/models/User.ts

I've got my Typescript setup using [rootDirs][1]. This is quite handy because I can have a shared folder for front- and back-end.

This allows me to rewrite an long ugly import statement

    import {User} from ""../../../shared/src/models/User"";

to this 

    import {User} from ""../models/User"";

This works well and my TypeScript service is happy and able to resolve all modules etc. The problem comes in with Webpack.

It doesn't seem to look at the tsconfig file for module resolution. So going to the [Webpack 2 documentation][2]. I found the following for resolve.modules.

> Tell webpack what directories should be searched when resolving
> modules.
> 
> Absolute and relative paths can both be used, but be aware that they
> will behave a bit differently.

I have tried configuring the modules :

     modules: [helpers.root('src'), helpers.root('node_modules') , helpers.root( '../shared/src')]

This allows me to use an import statement: 

     import {User} from ""models/User""; //Note the missing ../

But now TypeScript doesn't know what type it is any longer, since it breaks away from the rootDirs config. Ideally I would want Webpack and Typescript to be in sync. If I use the long relative import path then webpack and typescript are both happy.

See my [gist][3] of my config files.

Error I get when using '../models/User'

Both dev and prod builds build to a single 'dist' folder so it is not easy to build both and compare side by side. Additionally, when cleaning the project, this folder is removed which can be a problem in IDEs when trying to permanently exclude the folder from the project.

Builds are placed under a single ""build"" folder. This allows dev, prod, and aot builds to coexist. It also allows more targeted cleaning.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

[ ] support question

I have a component that has html as follows:

      <div id=""partners-slider"" class=""partners"">
            <div class=""partners__slider js-slick-slider"">
              <a class=""partners__item""><img src=""assets/logo-company-1.png"" alt="""">Elite Construction Group, LLC</a>
              <a class=""partners__item""><img src=""assets/logo-company-2.png"" alt="""">Pro Era Limited</a>
             </div></div>



Its basically a slider.
I have a library that I use in a lot of projects, for animations and stuffs. 

Theres a function as follows that initiates a slider:



    function initPartnersSlider(container) {
    var $partnersSlider = $(container) ;
    if (!$partnersSlider.length) return;

    $partnersSlider
      .find('.js-slick-slider')
      .slick({
        dots: false,
        infinite: true,
        speed: 300,
        slidesToShow: 5,
        autoplay: true,
        accessibility: false,
        prevArrow: $partnersSlider.find('.js-partners-prev'),
        nextArrow: $partnersSlider.find('.js-partners-next'),
        responsive: [
          {
            breakpoint: 1100,
            settings: {
              slidesToShow: 4
            }
          },
          {
            breakpoint: 1000,
            settings: {
              slidesToShow: 3
            }
          },
          {
            breakpoint: 768,
            settings: {
              slidesToShow: 1
            }
          }
        ]
      });}


Function Call:
`initPartnersSlider('#partners-slider');`

Problem here is 

    $partnersSlider.length

is always 0.

As per my understanding, the html element is placed inside a minified file by webpack (prod)

> main.bundle.js

 I am referring my external javascript file inside index.html as a script tag. It doesnt seem to recognise the dom element with `id=""properties-slider""` as the element is inside main.bundle.js?. I am able to debug and see it in my library code.

Has anyone done that before?

Move application config from a random area in the config folder to the package.json file.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

1424,2017-01-26 15:51:24,Officially out of good ideas. @shlomiassaf @katallaxie - Either of you ever mess around with pug? I know this worked at some point but i've never done anything with pug / jade ,d3viant0ne,
1424,2017-01-30 11:28:03,"Why don't you just use the default [pug-loader](https://github.com/pugjs/pug-loader) plugin?
Works fine for me: `a( [routerLink]=""['./']"", routerLinkActive='active' ) testing`


One issue though, you can't use `templateUrl` in your components, only `template: require('tpl.pug')` or `import * as tpl from './tpl.pug'` and `template: tpl()`...
unless you add the [apply-loader](https://github.com/mogelbrod/apply-loader) like this: `{ test: /\.(pug|jade)$/, use: ['apply-loader', 'pug-loader'] }`... kinda looks like it works",gizm0bill,

1424,2017-01-31 15:25:16,are you sure you tried on a clean install? It looks like some actual pug compilation bug,gizm0bill,
1424,2017-01-31 16:46:54,"pug-loader returns a function, on imports you must call that function, ie
`template: require('./template.pug')();'`

You must take in consideration that you need to write some angular expressions with '' take this snippet of code for example. 

`md-card('(click)'= 'functionCall(data.param)')`
if the call to (click) and the call to the function are not in '', app will break. 
This is exactly what I've been trying to avoid, using pug-plugin-ng + pug-html-loader https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug-plugin-ng",CarlosV89,
1424,2017-01-31 18:30:23,"Actually you only need to provide the `templateUrl` with a string, `angular-template-loader` or whatever it's called transforms it into a `require` call and `apply-loader` calls the function.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of tslint.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

It's a question/bug, about testing.
I know it sounds like it on angular side, but I think maybe I've ruined my configuration somehow.

* **What is the current behavior?**
 I've written a test : 
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And it works great !

But now, I'm trying to create an other spec file.
I was receiving this error - no matter which way I saw in github /stackoverflow - and just couldn't make it work !   **I've even tried copy and pasting the same spec content about to the new file, and it still throw an error !**

`     
TypeError: Cannot read property 'injector' of null
`

Why I'm asking this here? - because I saw in angular.io that for webpack we need to use `TestBed.initTestEnvironment(browser.BrowserDynamicTestingModule, browser.platformBrowserDynamicTesting());
` one time in our app,  - and we do.  
(this line  were the common reason for people to get this error message.)


I tried to debug Testbed after 'TestBed.configureTestingModule', and In the spec it worked, I see it holds the new created module.
and when I do it in the new spec, the testbed.module is null before and after the configure().
I wanted to ask you guys how you solved this ,
Thanks !


* **What is the expected behavior?**
making testBed.configure work on ""BeforeEach""

`import {TestBed, inject, async} from ""@angular/core/testing/test_bed"";` (B)

I think that way I imported a testbed (B) which was not attached to any environment - but I couldn't intialize an environment for it because it was already intialized for TestBed (A) in spec-bundle.

After that I changed (B) to (A).

[x] question about the decisions made in the repository

First of all, thanks for this seed.

I came from another starter using ngrx/store but for what I'm going to build, I think ngrx/store is not necessary ([great article](http://blog.angular-university.io/angular-2-redux-ngrx-rxjs/)). 

But HMR is a very interesting feature while in development mode. The thing is that your state (`AppState`) must be flat since we cannot mutate the state directly and the only way to update it is via

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Of course we can use it like this :

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I would have to do this for every 'substate' in my application, but I am wondering if it's a good way to go. Also using `public set(prop: string, value: any)` can be annoying since autocompletion is not available. This works only with one substate level. If I want to manage substates deeply, it's going to be harder.

Since everything stored in the state is also stored elsewhere (in the components as internalstate) , it seems that everything concerning the state should only be used in dev mode. Is that right ?

I was just wondering : did someone else have the same question and what do you think about it ?

Feature:
After using SASS in project, it's seem very essential to sharing `_variables.scss` in all SASS files, instead manually import it each time, which can be over head especially when styling Angular Components thats may locating deep in the project directories so the relative path to `_variables.scss` can be very long.

The problem is that it does not play nicely with relative imports.
It requires you to add **ALL** virtual SCSS files into the resource array in the webpack plugin configuration which is something that adds a lot of noise to the starter.  
I can live with that... but most devs won't know about it so they will just add `@imports` to the `_variable` file... we'll end up supporting sass resource loader.

* **What is the current behavior?**
I have fonts located under `/assets/fonts`. When I try to use one in CSS I get the following error:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
I add `url-loader` for font files and HMR and Prod builds work as expected. Fonts get inlined under a certain threshold and saved with a hash above this threshold. However, when running an AOT build, inlined fonts work but files which are expected to be saved externally are not created so I get 404s for `http://127.0.0.1:8080/fonts/629a55a7e793da068dc580d184cc0e31.ttf` 

* **What is the expected behavior?**
I would like to have AOT builds which save fonts separate from the bundle. Otherwise I'm forced to inline everything and bundle sizes are very large.

1406,2017-01-26 22:40:25,"A little more insight into this. The solution I described above only works because root-relative paths cause css-loader to skip hashing those assets by default. So, for example, if I add `?root=/.` to css-loader, this causes it to process root-relative the paths and the css will be changed to point to `[hash].ttf`. Plain prod builds work as expected here: the fonts are copied with hashed filenames and the css is updated to point to them. However, in AOT builds, while the css is updated, the actual hashed files are not being generated. ",bmayen,2017-02-01 14:03:50

1406,2017-01-31 16:06:28,"@bmayen the issue in #1428 happens on non-inlined assets within component templates/styles.

Are you loading fonts in component styles? bit excessive... if so turn `resourceOverride` off until the AOT plugin will handle assets.

Long story short, `resourceOverride` removes template/styles from `@Component` to remove space and let the AOT compiler handle them.
If you have resources in components then they won't get copied...

",shlomiassaf,2017-02-01 14:03:50
1406,2017-01-31 17:06:21,"Thanks for the feedback. 

Can you clarify what you mean by ""If you have resources in components...""? Aren't all resources in components?

We have a _fonts.scss file which defines styles which point to different fonts under `/assets/fonts`. This gets imported into our app.scss which gets included in app.component.ts styleUrls with encapsulation set to None. This is excessive? Open to suggestions for a better approach here.

In my mind, we would ideally be able to include all assets in our component styles and they would all be hashed in prod builds regardless of relative or root-relative urls. Is there a reason we wouldn't want this?",bmayen,2017-02-01 14:03:50
1406,2017-01-31 17:30:16,"> If you have resources in components...

Resources, such as jpeg, png, fonts etc... 

Usually, application wide resources (such as `_fonts.scss`) should be located in an application wide style sheet and not in a component specific style sheet.  
We have integrated global styles recently, see this [folder](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/tree/master/src/styles)

Having said that, you can solve your issue but the problem remains, the `NgcWebpackPlugin` with AOT compilation **and resourceOverride activated** does not support the `file-loader` or any other loader that emits multiple files from a single source.

For example, a loader gets a CSS files as an input an emits the css file content + 1 JPEG file that it found in a `url('...')` reference.

The reason is AOT compiler runs and passes templates/styles through webpack. Webpack does it's job, if `file-url` is activated it will replaces the content as normal.  
However, that is a different webpack and it only do loader chain so the files never get copied.

Next phase is bundling, again webpack (different instance) runs but this time all of those templates/styles are empty (`resourceOverride`) so hash files not copied.

If hashes are not created then the plugin that copies all asset folder cover up this issue, if hashes are created then that's a problem

> The assets plugin cover up is only valid if all assets are in the assets folder...

This is a tricky issue, it involves a lot of webpack internals... handling cache and invalidation, making sure an asset that was hashed would be copied but it's origin wont... I will fix it...",shlomiassaf,2017-02-01 14:03:50

* **What is the current behavior?**
In the environment.ts file there is an option to use custom providers depending on if you're in production or development. Ive tried to add an ""abstract"" class with the useClass: property. So I have 2 different implementations of the abstract class.
 PROVIDERS = [
    ...PROVIDERS,
    {
      provide: EnvironmentConstantsService,
      useClass: EnvironmentProductionConstants
    },
    // custom providers in production
  ];
Everything builds with AOT but when I try to run the application in the browser it seems it cant resolve my provided service. I've also imported and provided the ENV_PROVIDERS from environment.ts in my app.module.  Am I doing something terribly wrong?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng-router-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

It seems that ""server:dev:hmr"" includes HMR twice in the resulting bundle. The message ""[WDS] Hot Module Replacement enabled."" appears twice as well as change detection messages and so on.

* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem**
Just clone the starter project and run ""npm run server:dev:hmr"".

I guess it should be included only once?

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
It may cause some side effects during usage of HMR mode.

* **Other information**
I'm pretty sure that the current behaviour is not expected since there is the following statement in index.html:
`<% if (htmlWebpackPlugin.options.metadata.isDevServer && htmlWebpackPlugin.options.metadata.HMR !== true) { %>`

The second statement cannot evaluate correctly since HMR is not set. Thus ""webpack-dev-server.js"" will be included although it should not be since we are running HMR mode.

The import() construct is supported in webpack from 2.1.0-beta28

> ""async-system"" is deprecated in webpack 2 and removed in webpack 3.

Moving to 2.0.0 requires a subtle change in the TS loader order.

**Dev's that just upgrade the packages will have some trouble locating this change in the configs so we might expect some noise**

Reason for change:
Typescript transform `import(...)` syntax into something else.
To use `ng-router-loader` with `async-import` code generator the `ng-router-loader` must
 run **AFTER** the TS compiler (e.g: awesome-typescript-loader), that is in a lower index in the loaders array. If it runs before, TS will see the `import(...` expression and will convert it into invalid code.

This change also requires the code generators to emit ES5 code, all codegen's now emit ES5 code.

1387,2017-01-18 00:03:24,"@colinskow that's actually not related.

The modules are loaded at startup due to the route strategy, this is configurable.

They are still asynchronous, they just load automatically at startup but a separate bundle is there for each module.

This update doesn't add new functionality, it's more syntax related.

End result for all async code styles (require.ensure, System.import and import()) is logically the same...

Just remove the strategy the default should be nod preloading I think.

Anyway you can change it to what's available (see the docs) and you can create custom strategies

The definition of the `*.ts` loader is getting more complex.
We need AOT compliance so we use `angular2-template-loader`
We need lazy loading so we use `ng-router-loader`

As npm-run-all is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

In 1.1.0 depends on `@angular/tsc-wrapper` and `@angular/compiler-cli`

When `@angular/compiler-cli` bumps `@angular/tsc-wrapper` then **ngc-webpack** needs to do so as well... which is not ideal.

`@angular/compiler-cli` actually is `@angular/tsc-wrapper` since it re-exports all of the tsc-wrapper api... 

1.1.2 uses `@angular/compiler-cli` only.

I had a break when trying to compile a complex setup, took me 1 hour to find the culprit, `@angular/compiler-cli` was using `@angular/tsc-wrapper` 0.5.1 while **ngc-webpack** was using 0.5.0 :/

I am sorry I don't follow the guidelines for contributing to this repository. But I have a question about how to change the html img tag src path.
Ex:
I have a dummy.component.html. This is an angular component html.
And I have a img tag inside it  
`<img  src=""assets/img/photo.png"">`

When I run the **npm run build:prod**, the html will be inserted into the main.[hash].bundle.js.
the img tag src path still the same as it in dummy.component.html.

How could I make it like `<img src=""mypublicpath/assets/img/photo.png""> `when I run the **npm run build:prod** command?

I try to look at the webpack html-loader, but I could find any good example.
Can you guys give me some advices?
Thanks!!!",DanielYKPan,
1379,2017-01-19 22:07:08,"For the time being, I'm using html-loader to handle any images inside my HTML templates.

1379,2017-01-20 21:58:00,"@DanielYKPan I just simply used the html-loader instead of the raw-loader.

I started to look at https://github.com/TheLarkInn/angular2-template-loader. However, I'm not sure if that's right. There's got to be an easier way to rewrite the paths.

@d3viant0ne Can you provide any insight into this issue?",jgornick,
1379,2017-01-23 15:27:19,"@DanielYKPan I've found a solution that worked for me:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

That configuration will run any required HTML files through the `html-loader` (see `angular2-template-loader`). The `html-loader` requires any paths specified in `img:src` (i.e. images). Because the images are now being required into the dependency graph, we use the `file-loader` for any required `jpg|png|gif` images and write their path to `/assets/img/[name].[ext]`. Now the URLs in the HTML templates have the correct path to the image assets specified in `img:src` (e.g. `{output.publicPath}/assets/img/[name].[ext]`). 

This also plays nicely with the `CopyWebpackPlugin` found in the `webpack.common.js` configuration.

@d3viant0ne Is it worth submitting a pull request to run the HTML templates through the `html-loader`?",jgornick,
1379,2017-01-23 23:24:48,"@jgornick
I tried your solution on the clean latest angular2-webpack-starter project. It didn't work. I put your solution in webpack.prod.js, and specified the output.publicPath. The image assests still pointed to **/assets/img/[name].[ext]**, not **{output.publicPath}/assets/img/[name].[ext]**. 

Where did you put your solution to? And how you configure your project when this solution worked for you?",DanielYKPan,
1379,2017-01-24 16:03:07,"@DanielYKPan Interesting. I am running the latest versions of all packages in my setup. So that might be one of the areas you'll want to check.

1378,2017-01-16 10:18:07,"This PR improves the efficiency of the TypeScript build and resolves several issues that result from TypeScript compiling unnecessary files.

The current behavior is that on every build TypeScript compiles every single `.ts` file in the project tree. This is inefficient and can lead to issues when different files in the project require different configurations or use conflicting Typings.

The solution is to tell TypeScript specifically which entry files to compile, and it will automatically compile all their needed dependencies too. With this configuration TypeScript avoids compiling unnecessary files. `awesome-typescript-loader` doesn't seem to support passing in a configuration object, so this PR introduces a Webpack plugin which writes a temporary `tsconfig.json` file containing the correct entry files.

The only drawback is that lazy loaded modules need to be declared in `src/app/lazy-loaded.ts` or they will not get compiled. Maybe @shlomiassaf can write a script that automatically detects and adds them.

- Resolves #1366 
- Improves #1364 

Overall this PR makes builds faster, avoids some Typings conflict issues, and makes watch mode more efficient by watching only necessary files. It is also needed for my Electron branch to separately watch the main and renderer builds.",colinskow,
1378,2017-02-06 19:23:56,"Looks like Awesome TypeScript Loader is going to make this much easier to implement, so might as well wait until this issue is resolved before merging.

1378,2017-02-07 22:27:33,"@colinskow This introduces a lot of pitfalls.

The main one is the need to specify all of your lazy modules in a special file.
It makes lazy loading difficult more than it already is... lazy loading should be part of the route definition flow without extra requirements... 
This alone is a blocker for me...

Also, the final tsconfig is not known to the user, very blurry...

I think it will create more confusion, we better wait for s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader#364
",shlomiassaf,
1378,2017-02-07 22:43:53,"@shlomiassaf 

There are two ways TypeScript can work with lazy loaded modules:
1) Compile every single file in the project
2) Compile entry files, plus declared lazy loaded modules

If you want to avoid compiling everything, then there is no way around declaring lazy loaded modules. Remember when we used to have to declare vendor libraries?

The way around this would be to write a script that parses the dependency tree and detects lazy loaded modules on its own. But that's a lot of work for very little productivity gain in my eyes.",colinskow,
1378,2017-02-07 23:19:56,"@colinskow I'm not sure you are right, if this is the case lazy routes would never have worked and this is exactly why `ng-router-loader` exists.

Although `ng-router-loader` kicks in after `awesome-typescript-loader` finished TS to JS conversion it still adds a reference to a file (which is TS).
Webpack will load this file and send it through TS loader chain.

So anyway, the files goes through TS compilation hence TS type checking.

If `awesome-typescript-loader` will typecheck everything in the path of the entryPoint we're good.",shlomiassaf,

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As karma is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

[x] bug report
[ ] feature request
[ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
bug


* **What is the current behavior?**
When building using `npm run build:prod; npm run server:prod` the `process` variable is not defined.


* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).

**this was reproduced using a fresh pulldown of the master branch with only the change listed below**

1. add the line `console.debug(""PROCESS: "", process);` to the AppComponent (`ngOnInit` works).
2. run the project via `npm run start`
3. something similar to `PROCESS:  Object {title: ""browser"", browser: true, env: Object, argv: Array[0], version: """"…}` should be displayed in the browser console.
4. run the project via `npm run build:prod` and `npm run server:prod`
5. An error is displayed indicating that `process` is not defined.

* **What is the expected behavior?**
the global `process` variable is defined.


* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
this is a show-stopping bug that breaks any libraries that depend on the `process` polyfill.


* **Please tell us about your environment:**

- Angular version: 2.4.3
- Browser: Version 55.0.2883.95 (64-bit)



* **Other information** (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)

hmrOnInit gets fired way before any deep components are created - making it useless to any big application. because inputs doesn't exist yet.


So I my suggestions is, replacing :

The three of you that were having issues with this.

Are these fresh clones of the repo?
What is your NodeJS Version?
What OS are you running on?

That ""workaround"" should be causing the loader to use it's default which means it's targeting `tsconfig.json` not `tsconfig.webpack.json`

The options are ...

- Keep TypeDoc.
- Switch to Compodoc.
- Drop doc generation and let users add what they will.

Personally I don't run docs on my applications currently, though [Compodoc](https://github.com/compodoc/compodoc) is the first offering that has the potential to drive enough value to warrant the addition.

The Compodoc looks better, I must admit. 

If we consider things that does not belong to the starter, docs can easily fit in...
That said, promoting a doc system might help people document their OS code so it's good for the community.

I'm on board :)

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

[ x] bug report
[] feature request
[ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
bug  - but maybe a feature :-)


* **What is the current behavior?**

Currently if you have run an aot build and have a compiled/ folder, and then run the dev server, then at-loader runs across the compiled directory also, which increases compile time by a couple of seconds, but also shows errors if constructor injections in src folder change. 

* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** 

With a fresh copy of repo run the start:hmr and check at-loader completion times, then run build:aot, and then start:hmr again - at-loader times possible increased by several seconds.

If you delete compiled folder or change excludes in tsconfig.webpack.json to the following then at-loader completion times go down again.

  ""exclude"": [
    ""node_modules"",
    ""dist"",
    ""compiled"",
    ""src/**/*.spec.ts"",
    ""src/**/*.e2e.ts""
  ]

The above change does not appear to affect the AoT build process at all.
Maybe cleaning the compiled folder at the start of the dev server task is a better option?

* **What is the expected behavior?**

Existence of the compiled folder shouldn't affect dev build at all?

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

The extra at-loader completion time is not such a big issue, but getting at-loader errors about code in the compiled folder when running dev task is annoying.

* **Please tell us about your environment:**
- Angular version: 2.4.1
Windows",glendaviesnz,2017-01-16 18:53:43
1366,2017-01-13 02:38:14,"Currently the at-loader is using the same configuration file for AoT and JiT builds. `node_modules` is necessary to include since `@angular` and other dependencies live there. Excluding `*.spec.ts` and `*.e2e.ts` could possibly shave a few dozen milliseconds off each build.

We could also try specifying `""rootDir"": ""./src""` in `tsconfig.webpack.json` and see if that prevents unnecessary files from being scanned.

As far as `compiled` I usually run `npm run clean:aot` to remove this folder before doing a non-AoT build.",colinskow,2017-01-16 18:53:43
1366,2017-01-15 20:15:29,"@colinskow  had another look at this and even with ""compiled"" excluded in tsconfig.webpack.json at-loader still reports errors in the compiled folder when running dev server. This is because main.browser.aot.ts is still being included from src dir. Modifying tsconfig.webpack.json to the following seems to fix the issue, and AoT still works fine as main.browser.aot.ts explicitly listed as entry point in webpack config

This is my take on DLL integration: Using a plugin to control the whole process.

The plugin internally injects the low level DLL plugins provided by webpack (`DllPlugin`, `DllRegerencePlugin`) into the webpack instances.

The plugin handles both the webpack instance it get's registered on and a new webpack instance it creates for bundle generation.

The sole purpose of this plugin is to detect changes to the bundle structure.

Few points:
  - The plugin is async (promises). This is for future support of webpack package resolution (currently using node). This is important since webpack can resolve from other directories other then `node_module`.

  - The plugin is ready for live re-bundling. It detects a change in the package level so it can trigger a build per bundle. This will come in handy once live re-bundling is supported.

  - No need for extra configuration, everything is in the plugin, no extra commands.  
This makes it super easy to opt-out, just remove the plugin from `plugins`

> If a package is missing the process will throw (using the current config), it will not install from `npm` or `yarn`. This is how it should be, the plugin is not responsible for fetching packages, it just bundles the existing. 

[See source code](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/webpack-dll-bundles-plugin)

Change to the repo is minimal.

### PLEASE DO NOT MERGE UNTIL DISCUSSION ENDS

I did not have time for unit tests and proper documentation, I this PR is accepted I will appreciate any help on tests, documentation and adding support to some features.

Thanks.

1358,2017-01-09 21:35:28,"@shlomiassaf that's impressive! You took what I did to a higher level. Obviously it's better to handle the DLL build inside a Webpack plugin rather than the npm scripts.

Just a couple small points:
1) Add a `clean:dll` NPM script, and also add the `dll` folder to the `clean` script.
2) You should think about unit testing the logic of your package (outside the Webpack build)

The bottom line is that DLLs make dev builds run a lot faster, once the DLLs are built. This is a good merge as long as it doesn't have unexpected side effects or break existing builds that otherwise work.",colinskow,2017-01-11 06:25:21
1358,2017-01-09 22:58:29,"Another idea is to extract the DLL into a separate config file (I used `dll.config.js`). Since each developer will likely modify this list, this way they can pull updates from the starter with less work.",colinskow,2017-01-11 06:25:21

1358,2017-01-10 07:34:47,"@colinskow Once the config file is part of the repo it doesn't matter, you have to change the code.

I agree that splitting into a different file has logic to it but I also don't like to many configuration files... so my thought was lets make it super light, nothing fancy and if the user wants a more advanced config he can do it. In 99% of the use cases the common config is sufficient.

The config file for the DLL has nothing to it, it's based on the common... so, IMO, no need to have another config file.

As for unit tests, agreed, but as you can see from my post, I asked for help on that :)

I'll post a clean script later.

My thinking on separating the config file is that if I want to pull the latest `webpack.dev.js` from this repo, there are less conflicts to resolve if the DLL config (which most people will customize) is in a separate file. But I'm fine with either way.",colinskow,2017-01-11 06:25:21
1358,2017-01-10 08:21:29,"I agree that it should be in a separate file, ideally you shouldn't need to touch webpack configs at all, makes updating so much easier.

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As node-sass is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

* **What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (Bug fix, feature, docs update, ...)

Style improvement.

* **What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)

Currently the `root` function in the `helpers` module has some unpleasant code deemed necessary for compatibility reasons. It manipulates the arguments object via `Array.prototype.slice.call` and rebinds its actual argument which is a bad practice and is also confusing since the argument's value is ignored and it is effectively used as a variable.

* **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**

Cleans up the function and reduces code size.

- The addition of a separate build for the Electron main process
- Karma tests will run inside Electron
- E2E tests will be redone to use [Spectron](http://electron.atom.io/spectron/) instead of Protractor

1352,2017-01-15 06:18:07,"Thank you very much @JonnyBGod. You've given me some great ideas.

I'm currently working on setting up double watch builds, one for Electron and one for the Renderer. Whenever an Electron dependency is updated it should restart Electron (via electron-connect). And then I will connect the Renderer process to the Hot Module Reloader via a [custom server script](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/blob/master/server.js).

I found a [bug](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader/issues/351) in `awesome-typescript-loader` that causes Webpack to watch every single .ts file in the project, no matter what. So I'm working on getting the main and renderer builds to refresh independently only when their dependencies are updated. (Right now I've resorted to monkey-patching my installation of ATL.)

The other project I am working on is replacing Protractor with [Spectron](http://electron.atom.io/spectron/) since Protractor doesn't work well with Electron.

Quick remarks from my very quick look at it:

1. I think electron.main should be on a dedicated folder in root. This is because you potentially want to extend electron main capabilities and have multiple files for it.

2. I don't think NGRX fits this starter. That is why I created an advanced starter. NGRX is just too complex for most devs starting with angular2.

Would you be willing to implement your electron improvements in my [advanced starter](https://github.com/JonnyBGod/angular2-webpack-advance-starter)?",JonnyBGod,2017-01-11 07:21:11
1352,2017-01-26 23:30:57,"@JonnyBGod thank you for the feedback.

1. I created a separate `electron` folder inside `src` to place sub-modules for the main process. It felt awkward having them outside of the `src` tree. Ideally I would use a different folder structure, but I want to keep everything the same so I can easily pull updates from this repo.

2. Most devs who are just starting with Angular2 should be using Angular-CLI. This repo is really for those of us who aren't satisfied with CLI and are obsessed with customizing the build. Redux/ngrx is the absolute best way to manage state and scaling without it is a headache. I included a very simple implementation (one reducer, one action). It wanted to show how to hook it up to HMR, unit tests, and the Redux DevTools extension since that is tricky.

I just setup several DevTools extensions which will automatically install themselves in development mode.

IMO, the purpose of this starter is to provide the best build process, that does the essentials, in zero time.
It also needs to include some demo's for main features like lazy loading, injection etc...

Now, I can live with SCSS since it is considered essential but any post css out there is not.

I think the rule of thumb should be, will it work without it?
Not having a SCSS loader means SCSS will not work, so include it.
Not having an auto prefixer, still everything works.. dont include it.

Next thing will be adding translation support just cause it's cool :)

Again, IMO, This is the same approach we need to take with DLLs, its not essential nor expected by developers, it's still an ""early"" concept and make entry level users run away...
Yep, it's cool to have I agree, but this is a highly used repository so people should understand what's happening.

It's a money maker for the companies who will use this starter.

The DLLs are setup so they are totally transparent to the user, who gets automatic immediate productivity gains as soon as we test and merge the PR. It's not going to scare new people away since they don't need to get into technical details (which is just one plugin added to the dev build chain).

It can often become a bit tedious to include all the vendor prefixes for the CSS you use. Use an auto-prefixer to automatically add the prefixes you need to include.

Upgrade to `ngc-webpack@1.1.0`

* **Other information**:
`ngc-webpack@1.1.0` comes with 2 major improvements:

  - Run the angular complier from the `NgcWebpackPlugin`  
this makes configuration easier, removes cli steps and provides more control over the compilation

  - Remove `@Component` resources (template/styles) from the bundle.  
This is actually a great improvement to bundle size...
For each `@Component` the AOT compiler compiles it creates new representation for the templates (html, styles) of that `@Components`. It means that there is no need for the source templates, they take a lot of space... **Webpack** bundles out source files and the compiler files (`ngfactory`) so we get 2 versions of the same template/style in our bundle.  
This feature is `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin` for identified resources... the templates are replaced with empty files.

@gdi2290 @d3viant0ne please review...

Although I did full tests and double checks I suggest we wait several days for people to test this before merging.

1341,2017-01-06 03:48:44,"This PR introduces DLLs to dramatically speed up development builds. This theoretically should have zero side effects and not break any existing builds. (Although we should test thoroughly in the wild before merging.) The `check-dlls` script automatically detects when DLLs are missing or out of date (when the installed packages they reference change versions) and rebuilds them only when needed.

These enhancements are completely transparent to the developer. The user doesn't have to do anything to get performance benefits, but can edit `config/dll.config.js` to add additional packages to the DLL build. Anything that is missing will end up in common chunks and not cause any breakage (but won't be as fast as it could be).

In addition I:
- Added the DLL dev build to the `npm run ci` test so we don't break it by accident in the future
- Cleaned up the NPM scripts and removed some redundant ones that were getting called twice during builds
- Updated the README with DLL info and instructions for external stylesheets

I've been testing and whenever i use `cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack --progress --profile` alone i get this error:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
Along with 20 more of those lines with almost the same error but different problem


* **What is the current behavior?**



* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem**

Just try to run `cross-env NODE_ENV=development webpack --progress --profile` in the V6 branch will break the app like that.

* **What is the expected behavior?**

That it worked the same way the npm script containig such statement is, working ok.

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

Fix the build pipeline.

* **Please tell us about your environment:**

- Angular version: 2.1.2
- Browser: Chrome  55.0.2883.95

* **Other information** (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

[ ] bug report
[x ] feature request
[ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
*feature*


* **What is the current behavior?**
Currently the starter supports only Angular 2+ applications.

* **What is the expected behavior?**
Support bootstraping Angular 1 & Angular 2+ hybrid applications.


* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
Many of enterprise applications are still on Angular 1 and potentially most (or many?) of them would want to migrate to Angular 2. Assuming ngUpgrade is a de-facto solution for such an upgrade, it would be great if this starter supported bootstraping hybrid application as outlined here https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/upgrade.html#!#bootstrapping-hybrid-angular-1-2-applications


* **Other information**
* This feature I suppose should be an opt in/out.. But currently we do not have any strategy for opt in/out.
* We are raising this request in an attempt to explore possibility of such a support and also to gather feedback if this needs to be done in a fork

1335,2017-01-05 15:54:00,"The requirements to support any number of angular 1.x versions is a rabbit hole filled with stylistically & architecturally different upgrade applications.

- This is beyond the scope of what this was built for.
- It would add a bunch of bloat for the remainder of the community who won't ever use it.
- Too many ngUpgrade quirks to not purpose build a solution.

In short, there is no good way to take the one size fits all approach to upgrading existing 1.x applications. It's certainly possible to modify the starter to support an upgrade path, it is not on the other hand something I see as beneficial for this repo or it's consumers.

1335,2017-01-05 21:00:04,"> any number of angular 1.x versions is a rabbit hole...

@d3viant0ne On same page here, maybe we can pick latest version and just keep it limited to that.

> It would add a bunch of bloat for the remainder of the community who won't ever use it.

I guess this is where opt in/out can be considered? If still complicated, maybe we can resort to `angular2-recipes` as @katallaxie said.

> Too many ngUpgrade quirks to not purpose build a solution.

Agreed. Easy or Hard, I guess we would still need a support of some sort in form of build solution or receipes considering ngUpgrade is a de-facto solution for upgrading. 

Also, it's fine if we agree that it's something out of the scope for this starter. 

What I was wondering is, we have [NG6-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/NG6-starter) for NG1.x apps and this starter for NG2+ apps, it would be great if we have a build solution (or even receipes) that connects these 2 starters.",osdevisnot,2017-01-05 21:43:30
1335,2017-01-05 21:43:30,"That was kind of my point, they shouldn't be connected. This starter exists to facilitate the development of an Angular version 2.x or newer application. It doesn't support ngupgrade and shouldn't as you are adding a a bunch of functionality / complexity / bloat for a niche requirement outside the scope of this repo.

Adding things into master means we are making a technology choice for thousands of people, those choices need to be made with the best interests of the users & the library in mind. 

Adding opt in / out support for ngupgrade, regardless of limiting version is not in the best interest of either the majority of the consumers or the repo nor would we want to assume the maintenance costs of the validations and issues that would come along with it.

Furthermore in my personal opinion this is not something that I would ever choose to undertake professionally using a generic boilerplate. If you have requirements that necessitate the use of ngupgrade and all it's quirks, I would strongly encourage you to purpose build the base of that project using whatever starting point you deem appropriate for you and your team.",d3viant0ne,2017-01-05 21:43:30

As mentioned in the issue comments, this feature is worth having for large projects. This PR is an attempt to do this with minimal changes to common webpack config thereby trying to strike balance between huge config blocks and having to rewrite all of webpack common config.
This PR however does not address webpack blocks or ability to opt in/out.

**This PR is still WIP, please do not merge unless WIP label is removed from PR title**

**Note:** The DLLs currently do not work and needs more work. This PR is raised in an attempt to get feedback per the issues comments on #1330. Currently I see below errors on console:

The aot build success.

I want to use async/await, which is supported with typescript 2.1.4 when set the tsconfig's target to es5.
Although I can use babel + typescript to supported it, I still don't want to import other packages.

Just asking a question...

* **What is the current behavior?**

In the master branch AOT is configured and works very well.
But  the mentions to tree shaking are limited and not very clear.
Nevertheless, the size of the output in the current build:aot goes from 3,123 to 493 kb.

When I look in other sources for Tree shaking, it says that apparently needs a special configuration on tsconfig to use a different module management.

So my question is: Does the current version has Tree shaking or we can expect even smaller sizes when it becomes implemented?

That's all, small question....

I have a theoretical question (because at the moment, tree-shaking documentation is impossibile to find on this planet :)), but I want to explain in a better way using a concrete example.

For instance, I implemented tree shaking in a personal project and I'm able to run and navigate into my application. Very well!

Before tree shaking, my vendor.ts was something like this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

With tree shaking, I haven't a vendor.ts file, so how angular2-image-popup, angular2-ladda and so on are imported?
For example, **my application is working, but I can't find bootstrap and the other libs.**

For sure some of them aren't es2015 ready, but where should I import these libs in my project (the structure is similar to this project)? I mean...**I want to run my application with all libs, also If they aren't shaken :)**

If u prefer, my question could be 'How can I add a generic third party library into angular2-webpack-starter with tree shaking?'

* **What is the current behavior?**
Build Times are high since we are compiling/linking/building all the vendor libs every time we start the application in dev mode. 

* **What is the expected behavior?**
Build Times can be little lower using separate compilations of vendor libs.

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
We can leverage Webpack's ability to do compiling/linking/building in a separate build step to optimize the build times as outlined here -- http://webpack.github.io/docs/build-performance.html#dynamic-linked-library

Wait what @d3viant0ne? https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/tree/v6 

I'm honestly confused by this repo. The V6 branch is based on https://github.com/qdouble/angular-webpack2-starter which is at the moment one of the best starters when you want both AOT and DLLs. V6 was more tidy though, cleaned up, a little better file structure, typescript used in configs etc. a pretty good start, and the best thing was that it was using using @ngtools/webpack, so it was less hacky than qdouble's starter. There were couple of issues(https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/885#issuecomment-257735362) mostly with @ngtools/webpack, which kinda blocked it, most of them are now resolved though.

So what's the problem with going forward with that branch and finish it? Sometimes I feel like AngularClass's members never talk to each other, let alone to the community when it comes to plans or organization. I'd be more than willing to help finish it, if I at least knew what your plans are, what you feel is wrong with it or whatever, asked twice(https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/885#issuecomment-267594608 & https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/885#issuecomment-269942568) didn't get any answer.

The DLL packages must be specified manually in a config file, but anything not included there will simply fall back into the common chunks. I'm even working on a script that will intelligently update the DLLs when a dependent package changes.

This will require testing in the wild to ensure it doesn't break anything, but I think it should be safe to enable by default rather than opt-in, which would complicate things with lots of additional build scripts. The dev build speed benefits are huge.",colinskow,2017-01-11 06:26:34

* **What is the current behavior?**
Sourcemaps are no longer correct, since v5.2.0 (AOT support) when debugging TypeScript code, e.g. in browser (Chrome).

https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).
1) Debugging TypeScript code works correctly with sourcemaps in version before v5.2.0 (02716cc21a3f53f62f12aad5ae22c20dbe421048), so try that, e.g. home.component.
2) Debugging in any version after (02716cc21a3f53f62f12aad5ae22c20dbe421048) does not work as expected. Breakpoints are hit in incorrect locations and cannot be set in others.



* **What is the expected behavior?**
Correct sourcemaps for debugging with TypeScript.

It has worked before and must work in order to be productive.

If you simply test debugging in the commit before v5.2.0 and then test again with v5.2.0 you will see that sourcemaps (or something else) is broken, since it is no longer possible to correctly debug and set breakpoints in the typescript code.

Seems like it is related to this issue: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2145

They suggest changing `devtool` (in `config/webpack.dev.js`) to `eval-source-map`. It may be slightly slower, but breakpoints should work. (You should also experiment with different devtools to see what works and gives you optimum build time.)

The other options is to create a separate `tsconfig.webpack.dev.json` with `commonjs` module type for dev builds, since tree shaking doesn't make any difference here.

It just don't work with AOT...

Just look at the genDir defined in common, totally out of sync with the genDir in tscofig.

compiled/src/app VS compiled

Since it works you can rest assure something else won't once you get to different directory levels.

This is just the smallest problem... 

Im fine with reviewing it, I actually prefer to get feedback...  but angular-router-loader is far behind and doesn't really work in real world.. so we better of with this one

You probably don't understand the limitations `angular-router-loader` brings with it, if your webpack configuration is simple, yes it will works but it limits all of the goodies webpack provides... 

The problem itself probably relates to fact that `ng-router-loader` is asynchronous so it can use webpack to resolve paths.  
`angular-router-loader` is synchronous and it uses the file system to resolve paths.

I won't bother with details but the root cause is not using AST to parse the file, this is something in my todo list...

1321,2017-01-21 03:04:14,"@pleerock @pglazkov Try version 2.1.0

It uses AST now so it should be a lot better.
 
## Remember to make sure to put `ng-router-loader` to run **after** `awesome-typescript-loader`

I experimented with 2000 lazy modules.

Root has 2 lazy loaded modules.
1 of them (Details) has 1001 lazy modules: ChildDetail and 1000 .

ChildDetail has 1000 lazy modules inside of it.

You can see it in [this branch](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/angular2-webpack-starter/tree/ng-router-loader-2000-lazy-modules), all with links. 

I couldn't make an AOT production build due to an out of memory exception...
I believe it's because of the compilation dir, the typechecker is also parsing the compilation dir + source dir which is way too much.
If you try running dev, fine.
run AOT, out of memory.
run dev - out of memory - you need to delete the compilation dir.",shlomiassaf,2017-01-05 21:58:46
1321,2017-01-21 03:47:27,"@d3viant0ne The problem described by @pglazkov @pleerock fit's an issue that might happen with the older implementation (non AST).

The old process used regex with replace to transform the code.
On a module, if multiple lazy routes were set the old process had to take each and replace it.
Before replacing we need to resolve the actual file, this is an async process.
So since each ""replace"" is **async** I had to store the whole module code in memory and each replace that returned did the actual replace on that in memory ""source"".

The problem described above shows that some lazy paths were not replaced, which might indicate some race condition but I couldn't reproduce it, I tried 2000 lazy modules, no luck.

What's more confusing is that **async** is not a parallel, every instruction runs alone in the vm so I don't really understand what happened there.

My best guess is that it happens on win machines.

Anyways, I decided to refactor and use AST which is more accurate. I also made sure all changes happens sync.

You can take a look in [this branch](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/angular2-webpack-starter/tree/ng-router-loader-2000-lazy-modules), 2000 lazy modules, works for me.
It won't work on aot... see last issue why I think it doesnt work.",shlomiassaf,2017-01-05 21:58:46
1321,2017-01-21 04:02:33,"@shlomiassaf I was not happening only on windows machines. I have been having theses errors from time to time. No pattern that I can see just some random modules lost during compile time. It happens in production, dev, aot.

Most times work fine, some time fails, re run and its ok...

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of npm-run-all.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

The app launches with the aforementioned error (""Uncaught Error: Cannot find module ""C:\"""")  coming up.

I've tried pinning typescript to v2.1.1, didn't help me,

My Issue is as following:
    Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'C:\' in 'C:\Users\Dan\Desktop\angular2-webpack-starter-master'

I am currently adjusting my code for the AOT compilation but I have an issue with my scss. (im also using sass loader with webpack)
Here is the compilation error :

It should compiled everything with node sass.

Please give more info...",shlomiassaf,
1310,2016-12-29 18:46:24,"I can only guess since there's not a lot of information...

But it looks like you're trying to load a global scss file from within a component styleUrls... right?",shlomiassaf,
1310,2016-12-30 09:43:54,"@shlomiassaf  : You are correct, this happens also in my case, the scss files are being loaded directly through the component's styleUrls. 

An Idea would be to configure the `test: /\.scss$/` rule to work with `""extract-text-webpack-plugin"": ""^2.0.0-beta.4"",` so we can extract css files into the components' dirs and change our `templateUrl` reference to point to this? 



",feddyups,
1310,2016-12-31 01:26:03,"@feddyups No, `test: /\.scss$/` is to generic, it will take all SCSS files and send them to the header.

There are 2 types of stylesheets in an angular 2 application
 - Global styles (goes to head)
 - Component styles (live within the component)

Each component has a `ViewEncapsulation` property that defines the interaction of the styles so it's important to have SCSS files stay within the component.

Global styles can be in a specific app or prefixed, it's up to you actually (see #1304 and comments)

@BkSouX The error you posted indicates that the `@angular/compiler` tried to fetch a resource that was in the `styleUrls` of a component but it wasn't there.

This error also indicates that you are using an older version of this repo since this resource is loaded by the `compiler-cli` and not `ngc-webpack`

Anyway, if the file is not present `ngc-webpack` will throw as well...

check your files...

* **What is the current behavior?**
When running tests while using a getter for `ModuleWithProviders` (e.g: `forRoot()`) an exception is thrown: `TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object`

Running build/dev (`npm run start`) works without an error.

Reproduce:

  - Create a file `test.module.ts` in `app` folder.  

  - Paste this code:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

  - Open `app.component.spec.ts` and replace the whole content with:  
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

> What was added:
import { CoreModule } from './test.module';  
imports: [ CoreModule.forRoot() ],


Now `npm run test` see error:

Remove `.forRoot()` -> `npm run test` -> # NO ERROR!

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As script-ext-html-webpack-plugin is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

@d3viant0ne @colinskow @qdouble 

**What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)
When using AOT compilation, `@Component` templates (HTML, CSS, SCSS, etc...) are not running through the webpack loader chain.

Development output might not be the same as AOT output.

For example, CSS that goes through `postCSS` processing (autoprefixing, etc..) will not work when AOT compiling.  

If we want to use SCSS, html transformation or any other webpack goodie we can't.


* **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**
Use  [ngc wrapper](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngc-webpack) to provide resourced after they have passed the webpack loader chain, based on the webpack configuration provided.

The type of resource is irrelevant, if there's a loader configuration for it it will go through it.

* **What is the current behavior?**
awesome-typescript-loader incorrectly transpiles **const enum**


* **What is the expected behavior?**
awesome-typescript-loader should transpile **const enum** by replacing the variable name, with its respective representative integer.


* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
Please refer to the GitHub issue: [Const enum are preserved and not replaced with actual values #137](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader/issues/137)

We are concerned about how many projects in the wild that are being transpiled incorrectly because of this bug.  This issue has been standing in their repository for months without being addressed.  We are making a feature request to consider [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) as the choice of loader for the starter kit, as it correctly transpiles **const enum**

[ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) loader seems to adhere to typescript standard better, and is more responsive to crippling bugs.  We should consider this seriously.",ZenSoftware,2016-12-28 20:37:41
1305,2016-12-28 20:37:41,This cannot be replicated with the starter. Using examples from [Enums](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html) produces expected results.,katallaxie,2016-12-28 20:37:41

1305,2016-12-29 03:55:30,it would be great if someone can reproduce the error otherwise it's just an awesome-ts side-effect that we can't account for and ts-loader is too slow,gdi2290,2016-12-28 20:37:41
1304,2016-12-28 00:50:38,"In production apps it is a bad practice to inline large CSS files to Javascript, as it can slow initial page load and cause unstyled HTML to flicker.

This PR adds the ability to put SASS or CSS files in the `./src/styles` directory, import them into a module, and they will generate an external CSS file on production builds. On dev builds they are imported using the `style-loader` to support hot module reloading.",colinskow,2017-01-05 03:01:58
1304,2016-12-28 23:41:56,"@colinskow I used a different take on this.

I used a convention to identify global SCSS files: `some-style.global.scss`

Then a loader:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

> The component SCSS loader must also `exclude: [/\.global\.scss$/],`

Now all `*.global.scss` files are set in the head.

This is of course not a separate file for styles but it differentiates between global and component local styles.


Now, for having styles in a separate file, this is something I think the developer should decide.

I think we should put the extract plugin to target 1 file, all other files the dev wants to include he should import from that main (and not from JS code).

If he imports from JS code it goes to the head.

**My reasoning about this is that if all styles are in 1 directory it's far more logical to import them all from one file inside that directory, similar to an `index`file in a package/module/barrel.**

I see this directory as the `theme` for the app, plus it's more aligned with SASS `@import`s...

I have a problem with style imports scattered around the project, it's hard tracking their order and that's important for CSS.",shlomiassaf,2017-01-05 03:01:58
1304,2016-12-29 01:56:52,"The order of the CSS will be the order the files were imported. I've created a styles directory where all the external styles will originate, and I think we should leave it to the developer to choose a convention. They are not scattered around the project, except for the Angular component styles which are inlined with the JS.

I library like Bootstrap can be imported by putting a file in the styles directory and using @import.",colinskow,2017-01-05 03:01:58

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of istanbul-instrumenter-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

Bug


* **What is the current behavior?**
Using async / await in current setup throws exception where __generator is not defined on  ZoneAwarePromise (polyfills.bundle.js).


* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
Being able to use async / await with latest TypeScript 2.1 and es5.

1294,2016-12-23 09:06:10,TypeScript 2.1.x isn't supported by Angular 2.x. You will have to wait until Angular 4.x,d3viant0ne,2016-12-23 09:06:10
1294,2016-12-23 10:48:29,"Can you explain what you mean with ""TypeScript isn't supported by Angular 2.x""? TypeScript is the preferred language when writing Angular 2 apps. Since the async / await is compiled to es5 JavaScript code with the use of a polyfill containing a correctly implemented Promise it should work, or at least I thought so.

Please explain why Angular 2 is a specific problem for this scenario, compared to Angular 4, since it feels like I am missing something here.

Thanks!",WillooWisp,2016-12-23 09:06:10
1294,2016-12-23 13:04:06,"Can't see any real info about that it should not work, only some specific cases. I do use TypeScript 2.1.4 together with Angular 2.2.4 and it works great. The problem is the zone promise class being used and cannot be switched out. That promise does not work in conjunction with async / await.",WillooWisp,2016-12-23 09:06:10
1294,2016-12-23 13:09:11,"There are other threads around that topic as well. The general consensus is it's not supported and won't be for a while. If you choose to push past what is in Angular's package.json you are in uncharted waters.

Async/Await is a cool feature and i'm sure i'll be leveraging it in another 6 months when it has robust support. You could create an issue over at Angular but i'm all but positive they are going to tell you the same thing.",d3viant0ne,2016-12-23 09:06:10

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of tslint.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Still trying to wrap my head around some of this but this was the first start I have seen where the solution still uses # in the URL. Is there a reason that still has to be used? One of the nice things about Angular2 is that we no longer had to deal with # in the URL.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of zone.js.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

I'm Angular2 beginner and I'm fighting with an issue for that last few days and still cant figure out how to do it. I've checked all issues and I couldn't find any information.
I've installed your app and everything is working well.
So, my issue is: 
1. I'm trying to set global SCSS (in the root or /scss ) file outside of my components and tell Webpack to compile it. So how to do this? 
2. Then how to load the compiled file? Should I specified somewhere? index.html?

Just to mention: 
in app.component I've changed ViewEncapsulation to ViewEncapsulation.Emulated

Thanks you !",venelinn,2016-12-20 16:05:37

* **I'm submitting a ...**
[x] bug report
[ ] feature request
[ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

* **What is the current behavior?**

You read through the README as far ""Run tests"", try it and then assume that's run all the tests. So I went to add a failing e2e test and then was briefly surprised and confused that the test code had all passed.



* **What is the expected behavior?**

It may be better to say ""Run unit tests"" so that people read on and see how to run the e2e tests. It may also be worth a few words on why the e2e/protractor tests are handled differently from the unit tests.

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

Okay, this is trivial, but it would have saved me a few minutes confusion.

* **Please tell us about your environment:**

Windows 10, and I simply cloned angular2-webpack-starter and started experimenting.


* **Other information** (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)

I can submit a pull request if you agree this is worth addressing (in a couple of weeks after the holiday season)",dickon,2016-12-17 14:12:24
1277,2016-12-17 14:12:24,"@dickon - `npm run test` is intended to just run the karma suite.

For the e2e tests, you need to run some sort of server for Protractor to execute against. In a CI environment, that requires additional commands prior to the execution of the e2e tests.

The same is applicable for running the test watcher during active development, where you normally don't want to be running an e2e suite which can involve other services to be running in most data driven applications.

The validations are split intentionally which is both the community standard way to handle testing and the most flexible as well as, imo having the best overall development experience.

If you want to change how the tests execute in your own application, you are of course free to do so but I am betting after some time working with it that way you will find it to be more cumbersome than beneficial.",d3viant0ne,2016-12-17 14:12:24

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of tslint.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Not your fault, but doesn't work under WSL bash because `node-macaddress` makes an as-yet unsupported system call to `os.networkInterfaces()`:

> ERROR in ./~/css-loader!./src/app/app.component.css
> Module build failed: Error: EINVAL: invalid argument, uv_interface_addresses
>     at Error (native)
>     at Object.lib.networkInterfaces (/mnt/c/projects/angular2-webpack-starter/node_modules/macaddress/index.js:31:21)

Fortunately it was easy to work around by installing a patched fork of `node-macaddress`:

1272,2016-12-14 16:11:27,"bug report
report a *bug* After typescript 2.0.6 the build process stuck at loading js. No debug error happens but seems infinite burning CPU.

Stuck point: 

Project is running at http://localhost:8888/
webpack output is served from /
Content not from webpack is served from xxxxxxxx
404s will fallback to /index.html                                                                                                67% building modules 1165/1226 modules 61 active ...

No debug log and nothing different to verbose mode.
I also switch between node from 7.2.1 to 6.9.2 nothing changed.
The stuck point is building a module that if I remove that module it stuck to another one. so something general must be wrong during the module js file loading.


Solution is to fix the typescript version to 2.0.6 instead of ^2.0.6

I used the steps described in the wiki, but used different package versions, because of incompatibilitites:

npm install --save-dev sass-loader@^4.0.2 css-to-string-loader  resolve-url-loader file-loader url-loader tslint@^4.0.0 css-loader@^0.25.0 codelyzer@^2.0.0-beta.3 node-sass@^3.13.1
npm install --save bootstrap-sass ng2-bootstrap

Everything else I did according to the wiki entry.

* **What is the expected behavior?**

Bootstrap path is loaded in scss file

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

Use of Bootstrap 3 and Sass and ng2-bootstrap

1. per #1265 Nitrous is no longer available. I have removed it and added a deploy section that includes Netlify. 

2. Added a [Netlify button](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/11/29/introducing-the-deploy-to-netlify-button/) for easy deployment

* **Other information**:

When you click on a “Deploy to Netlify” button, you’ll be redirected to Netlify’s direct deploy page. There you’ll be able to create a new site based on the template you were looking at. While this is happening. Netlify also creates a new GitHub repo for the new site. The best way to understand how this works is to see it in action, try it out:

It may be a minor patch; but wanted to confirm before doing so.

The following line uses [arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments) object rather than using `args` variable passed to the respective function `root`. Is there a specific reason for doing so, or is this redundant?

* **What is the expected behavior?**



* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

I've started using the angular2-webpack-starter app.  After using a bit, I wanted to install another package.  I run the npm install -g <package> command and that's about as far as I get.  I'm not sure where I need to go to ensure my app recognizes this new package.  For the novices out there, it would be good to understand how to get webpack/angular2 to recognize any new packages that were install.

I've search high and low for an example on this but apparently I'm not asking the right question, or I'm just not understanding the differences in how webpack and native angular 2 are setup.  Having a writeup explaining the differences and examples on how to properly wire up a new package would be great.

not sure it matters, but the specific package was ng2-nouislider

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As karma-jasmine is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

As I forked `angular2-webpack-starter` before [that commit](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/commit/306672798cf5865037ccba37ac7aa4feb89c2110#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2) of 23-Nov, it was `^2.2.1` just for the `@angular/forms`.

So my full fix was:

1. Modified `package.json` to set:

- `""typescript"": ""2.1.1""` (use to be `^2.0.6`, which brought me `v2.1.4`)
- `""@angular/forms"": ""2.2.1""` (use to be `^2.2.1`, which brought me `v2.3.0`, when other `@angular/` were `2.2.1`). As an alternative, you can make them all `^2.2.1` and it will work again as all `@angular/` versions will be aligned.

2. Deleted corresponding folders in `node_modules` and ran `npm install`. For some reason, running `npm install` straight away didn't work (something was cached?).

1248,2016-12-09 10:27:47,"As far as I remember in production build vendor name is appended file hash, so that should help in that case. Dev builds should not be run on productions, as they lack the glory of tree shaking and uglification.

This behavior is produced by WebpackMd5Hash plugin.",karolmie1,
1248,2016-12-09 16:14:43,"@naivefun - There are quite a few ways to implement cache busting. I personally roll with something like this but I also have a moderately complex caching setup between my app, docker containers & nginx.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Point being, this is one of those things that is really dependent on exactly what you are trying to achieve and how you are setup. Any way it goes, you will need `WebpackMd5Hash` as @karolmie1  mentioned.

It's also worth noting that what I run in production isn't based off the starter, so just grabbing that snippet isn't going to work ( just an example ).

I highly suggest reading https://webpack.js.org/guides/caching/ more than once and then start hacking on your project. Caching is one of those things you can get ""kind of right"" and end up with weird results.  

You are going to want to understand your own caching implementation completely as it pertains to your app & the deployment stack it is running on. Docs + Trial and error is the best way to get there imo.",d3viant0ne,

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of imports-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

### Error Unexpected value 'FileUploadModule' imported by the module 'UploaderModule'
valor-software/ng2-file-upload#426

Is there a reason - why - we need relative paths for external Typescript modules?
Is it a systemjs that cannot load - a typescript only NODE_MODULE


C:\workspace\angular2-webpack-starter\config\webpack.common.js
**Does not work** - modules: [helpers.root('src'), 'node_modules' ],
**Works - modules:** [helpers.root('src'), helpers.root('node_modules' )],


### How to replicate?

1. npm install - https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter
2. npm install https://github.com/georgebatalinski/PUBLIC_NODE_MODULE
3. C:\workspace\angular2-webpack-starter\src\app\app.module.ts
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
4. npm start 
Expected: get error 

####TO fix 
C:\workspace\angular2-webpack-starter\config\webpack.common.js

**to** [helpers.root('src'), helpers.root('node_modules' )],

1241,2016-12-05 17:09:02,"Depending on how your CI / CD workflow is setup, your deployment stacks should be pretty close to identical thus your issues shouldn't be environmental. A really good tool for this would be docker.

The point of a production build outside of obfuscating your code ( if you choose to ) is really to reduce your payload as much as is humanly possible to limit the amount of .js / .css a user has to download to view your application. Uglify usually takes care of this. What you end up with it a gigantic block of truncated function & variable names, which is in general a real pain to debug. 

Some modern browsers have gotten smart enough to only make the http call to grab sourcemaps if you open the dev tools but some older browser version will simply pull them down, increasing your payload ( considerably ).

Point being, you really shouldn't have to debug a production deployment. The goal should be to catch issues like that in your deployment workflow. How you do really depends on your team / infrastructure.

Some people run a staging stack and do blue / green deployments with a sourcemap enabled build. I have seen others who don't want or need to go that far run a `production like` build to a QA stack with sourcemaps enabled.

I was a DevOps engineer before switching to frontend dev, if you want to have a more in depth discussion about a workable CI/CD workflow you can find me in the AngularClass slack channel.",d3viant0ne,2016-12-05 16:26:52

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of parse5.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

I am trying to implement PostCSS autoprefixer to my project but it doesn't seem to work. After going through the instructions on the PostCSS repo, I still have no luck so was hoping someone can assist. I have followed the steps as below

2. webpack.common.js snippet as below

3. I have created a postcssconfig.js with the following plugins

Is there some other setting or config that needs to be added? The vendor prefixes do not work e.g. display: flex in a sample scss file

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of tslint-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

yarn.lock will be treated as binary file, and won't clutter pull requests, but all the good things it brings will still be there!

* **What is the current behavior?**
currently the entry point for the app is index.html I am trying to change it so index.html is a static page and app.html is the angular page.

I changed in webpack.dev.js the historyApiFallback to 
`historyApiFallback: {
        index: '/app.html/'
      },`
and added to webpack.common.js
`exclude: [helpers.root('src/app.html'), helpers.root('src/index.html')]`

so the dev server serves the files from app.html. I still can't get it to serve the static index.html page.
Also when building, index.html is being created, and not app.html

the link to the slack channel is broken, so I try to aks my question here.

I try to get an external Css Lib (KendoUi for Ng2) to get loaded with webpack and Ng2.

So my Question is the wiki entry tells how to load styles with the StyleUrl, is the compiled style included in the bundle.js or an additional entry in my index.html as bundle.css?

https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-use-Bootstrap-3-and-Sass-and-ng2-bootstrap

Because I've get my kendo styles working with the templateUrl like you describe, but my problem is that the styles are only accessable in the component I loaded the styles. When I use navigate to an other view where I've not included the styleUrl then the styles are not globaly loaded. Is there a magic trick that this works?

    @Component({
       selector: 'sxp-app',
       templateUrl: './app.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./../../node_modules/@telerik/kendo-theme-default/dist/all.css']
    })

My Loader Entry

      {
           test: /\.css$/,
           use: ['to-string-loader', 'css-loader']
     },

that works fine for local styles but not global, how can I get my styles to be global or better how to render the styles as .css in my index.html?

[x] Need a How-To

* **What is the current behavior?**
I've cloned angular2-webpack-starter repository and runned the following commands:

`npm install`
`npm run build:prod`

Everything seems ok but when I copy generated /dist folder inside the root of my apache web server and open the app from my web browser at localhost (http://localhost/dist/index.html) nothing appear on the screen except

`Loading...`

In the browser console there is any message.
From debugger window of my web browser developer tool I can see files that are actually download (i.e. index.html + linked resources). Only two files are downloaded: index.html and analytics.js; that is a little bit strange.

Instead, if I run the following commands:

`npm run server`

and open my browser at http://0.0.0.0:3000 it works fine.

* **What is the expected behavior?**
To deploy app simply by copy and paste /dist folder to web server public/root folder.


* **Please tell us about your environment:**
- linux mint
- apache web server

could you tell me how to load component templates from external url? 
I have removed `angular2-template-loader` from webpack.common.js but then I'm stuck.

Let's say I am hosting my (MVC) website at `localhost/MyWebsite `and I set: `<base href=""/MyWebsite/"">` on the page hosting angular app.

I try load the template using `templateUrl: ""/templates/app.component.html""` but the request goes to `""localhost/templates/app.component.html""` instead of `""localhost/MyWebsite/templates/app.component.html""`

How to make angular respect  `<base href=""/MyWebsite/"">` ?

I'm currently struggling when I try to migrate my project into your webpack-starter. Most things work okay but I need bootstrap classes from bootstrap.min.css.

Currently I`ve got the following in my webpack.common.js:

module: {
   rules: [
      {
         test: /\.(woff2?|ttf|eot|svg)$/,
         use: 'file-loader'
      },
      {
         test: /\.css$/,
         use: ['to-string-loader', 'css-loader']
      }
   ]
}

In my main.browser.ts I currently have:

import './assets/css/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css';
import './assets/css/styles.css';

but I'm not sure if I have to do a require here instead but both doesn't work for me. I get no error message but the bootstrap grid system is not available when I run localhost:3000.

Any help would be very appreciated. ",jScope,2016-11-29 09:29:45

I already know about this solution. I was just asking myself if there is a way to only include the ""bootstrap.min.css"" because I just use bootstrap grid structure and other css classes.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of istanbul-instrumenter-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

*feature*


* **What is the current behavior?**
css is inlined in bundle. 
would like to be able to directly edit css files through the broweser - with Chrome's workspace feature.
(would probably need source maps from inline styling to css files in src/)


* **What is the expected behavior?**
editing CSS on Chrome browser with configured workspace would change local files permanently in src/ directory.

This is how the browser style pane look now, the style is inline and not as part of any file :

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
Editing CSS directly save a LOT of time - when changes reflect immediately in the browser and saved to the source files.
As a designer, I try different style options (eg. border weight/color) until I find the right one. When I do, the best thing would be if it would be saved in the source files.

So far, this is the only thing keeping me off from using Angular 2.

Build Pipeline Fixes & Improvements


* **What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)
There are numerous issues with the current CI pipeline. Outside the fact that it currently just doesn't work, the time to feedback to the developer is a bit excessive and we don't cover enough of the tooling in out CI runs.


* **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**

- [x] Fixes issues with TSLint.
     - Codelizer doesn't yet support Tslint 4.x the peerDep fails builds on Node 4.x
- [x] Fixes style issues merged while linting was broken.
- [x] Removes yarn from the travis build ( this loses us time not saves it ).
- [x] Updates to Trusty from Precise.
     - The Trusty container comes with Chrome installed & configured
- [x] Removes the docker build as we aren't doing anything with it thus costing us more time.
- [x] Updates Protractor version.
- [x] Executes e2e tests in Travis against production build for slightly better tooling coverage.
     - Adds a `server:prod:ci` script to run http-server on port 3000. Local development e2e tasks are uneffected

* **Other information**:

Temporarily sets node 4.x to `allow_failures` due to an issue in the `LazyParseWebpackPlugin` on nodejs 4.x running on Ubuntu. Issue link is in the Travis config.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

under module.rules add

Angular Material integration is quite straight forward.

Saying that, if you are using bootstrap loader and saas loader like, it's very easy to include material scss.

in **.bootstraprc** add the below line.

`appStyles: PATH_TO_YOUR_APPLICATION_SCSS`

and in your **APPLICATION_SCSS** add the material theme imports. You can use any theme here.

`@import '~@angular/material/core/theming/prebuilt/pink-bluegrey.scss';`

It seems it has to do with the DLL's related to Rxjs, as soon as i delete the generated ones and comment the map import in dll's array in `src/dll.ts` it works ok.",luchillo17,2017-01-25 21:51:40

1196,2016-11-23 12:34:59,"@ranakrunal9 Indeed, however they seem to think the error is in the lack of dll generation, while i see the error in dev builds, i've managed to fix this by commenting the map path in the dll's array and generating again the dlls.

It's like if the import collided because the dlls make them and i do so as well in my code.",luchillo17,2017-01-25 21:51:40

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of tslint-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
I think travis should check the following during a PR build:

  - npm run lint

  - npm run test


* **What is the current behavior?**
Apparently they're not executed at the moment


* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
Lately it happens quite a lot that PRs not passing linting/tests are merged into the master, causing lot of troubles

* **What is the current behavior?**
Running npm run lint from the latest [angular2-webpack-starter repo](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter) causes the following error that seems to be originating from importDestructuringSpacingRule.js which wasn't happening a few days ago.

* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** 
1. Pull latest master
2. Run `npm run lint` to produce error

* **What is the expected behavior?**
`npm run lint` shouldn't error

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
For projects to be able to continnue using linting features as part of build success criteria.

For tracking when we can upgrade:

The fix for this has landed, it required a fix in 2 packages.
  - [istanbul-instrumenter-loader](https://github.com/deepsweet/istanbul-instrumenter-loader/issues/35)
  - [remap-istanbul](https://github.com/SitePen/remap-istanbul/pull/87)

So, basically the up-to-date version of **istanbul-instrumenter-loader** is fine.
The problem is with **remap-istanbu**, we need to wait for them to publish *0.8* that will include the fix.

I disabled the reports since it's a lot of work for me to go back from **use** to **loaders**",shlomiassaf,2016-11-25 04:24:24

1. Clone.
2. Run `npm i` in project folder.

I'm reporting a bug that happens when bundling the V6 branch in production with: `npm run build:prod && npm run server:prod`


* **What is the current behavior?**
If i bundle with dev mode, all is ok, but when running with: `npm run build:prod && npm run server:prod` it shows the error: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object`.


* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** 
1. Clone repo.

3. Run `npm i && npm run build:prod && npm run server:prod`.
4. Open `https://localhost:8080` and the error should be in browser console.



* **What is the expected behavior?**
I hope to see the page when open the prod url http://localhost:8080/#/, instead got that error in browser and webpack didn't complain by any errors.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Fix a bug that appears with Angular2.2 when using a production bundle.

* **What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)
Currently, when launching a prod bundle, the app doesn't work because of an `Cannot convert undefined or null to Object` that occurs in the `disableDebugInfo` function of Angular2.2.
This function tries to delete `window.ng.provider`, but at the moment of the call of the `disabledDebugInfo` function, the `ng` property has not yet been created in the `window` object because Angular is not yet initialized.

* **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**
We now wait for Angular to be initialized before disabling debug info and enabling production mode.
This way, the `disableDebugInfo` call succeed and the app doesn't crash anymore.

* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
Report a bug


* **What is the current behavior?**
Using the following expression within a webpack.<env>.js file returns undefined because ""metadata"" is not a valid property of the object returned by the module.exports function in webpack.common.js:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>


* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).

Insert the following code at webpack.dev.js::23 of the current project:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
then run ""npm run build"" and you will see the following output:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>
where ""undefined"" is the metadata from webpack.common.js, and therefore is not able to merge properly with any webpack.<env>.js file.


* **What is the expected behavior?**
Somehow metadata should be on the object.
A valid metadata object should be returned which can be merged with the env-specific webpack config


* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

1175,2016-11-16 18:58:58,"As a suggestion, I fixed this locally by creating a ""webpack.metadata.js"" file using a similar structure as the ""webpack.common.js"" file and requiring/calling the metadata file from within the separate env-specific webpack files, as follows:

Gets around the core issue (that webpack cannot export properties other than the ones explicitly allowed) and does so in a manner consistent with the way these files are managed.

[x] question about the decisions made in the repository

I don't understand the purpose behind `AppState` (app.service.ts). Is this intended to store additional state for `AppComponent` (in other words a sort of store what `AppComponent` may need to share) or is it more a generic store for all components of the application?

I am leaning more towards just a shared, non-reactive service to store & share state.

What are the use cases of `AppState`? Storing the currently authenticated user?
",cmckni3,2016-11-12 19:38:58
1169,2016-11-12 06:28:44,"Rolling the state back up the tree to a `single source of truth` prevents you from mutating shared state which will have unintended / undesired side effects in your application that are extremely difficult to run down in a large application. In short, you want as many dumb components as is humanly possible.

What Patrick implemented is very similar to `ngrx` in a lot of ways. For instance if you look  [here](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/src/app/app.service.ts#L19-L22) this implementation attempts to prevent people from mutating state directly, leading to the issue described above.

Inevitably you will need to maintain state in your application and inevitably you will need your applications components to communicate. Angular2 is designed to flow data / state down and events up. Your lower level components simply take `@Input()` & `@Output()` which makes them reusable and easier to maintain / test. As your application grows, this approach also makes it much easier to reason about your application state given you always know the beginning and end of every state change.

As an aside, this implementation is also very simple to convert to use something like `ngrx` should you or your team decide you want to leverage that particular suite of tools.

1169,2016-11-20 00:40:36,"Sorry, but I am still confused. With a reactive store the components can do .subscribe() to update their own state automatically whenever the central state changes. Can you more info on how to do this with the current AppState?

1169,2016-11-20 12:14:43,"@JimTheMan don't be confused. It is just a a demo. If you want to have a fully reactive store, and harvest actions, reducers, and effects, then you should use `ngrx`. Which I do in almost all of my projects. I guess some of the things in the current starter do not belong there, or are just really a starter. You could use the `v6` which doesn't include many of these things.

1169,2016-11-20 14:10:20,"Hi @katallaxie! Not sure what you mean about v6. The v6 branch has the same AppState in AppComponent as the master branch.

It's not so much that you don't have to wait for the browser to flash but more that your state is preserved. The fact that you don't have to navigate through and set up your state again is probably what will save you the most time.

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As protractor is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?

1164,2016-11-20 21:23:36,"We spoke via email and gave a preview of our current progress (which one course will be out soon) and issued a refund.

Quality takes time. While starting the courses in the Master Bundle We realized the community was missing a ton of advanced content. This meant that we either would need to cover advanced topics within each course or start releasing our separate content to reference. A good example of this is our current Fundamentals course which skips a lot of the conceptual topics since there's a ton of content already out there already. We provide a guided path of how to build an app in the real world. Following this teaching style we quickly realized all of the courses within the Master Bundle requires knowledge of advanced patterns which aren't covered anywhere online. We decided that we would have to create advanced content so we have something to point to as references. We started by creating a Router course and an Advanced Components courses only to combine them into one course as Advanced course to cover more content. Right now anyone who bought the Master Bundle gets everything for free until we finish the courses. So that means everyone will get the complete path to becoming an expert at Angular 2. This is different from content release right now which doesn't provide a path because it simply takes more thought to create. We're also providing real-world advanced patterns seen in large Angular 2 apps in production. Also, the introduction of NgModule dramatically changed the way we should be architecting our applications so previously we had a great plan and progression on how to guide users to becoming experts. After NgModule we first had to figure out new patterns that developers should be doing and figuring out the correct approach. Because of that huge change we had to regroup and delay the release. If you followed our Fundamentals course then you would know that it was right before NgModule

1160,2016-11-10 12:34:21,"Quality takes time. While starting the courses in the Master Bundle We realized the community was missing a ton of advanced content. This meant that we either would need to cover advanced topics within each course or start releasing our separate content to reference. A good exaof this is our current Fundamentals course which skips a lot of the conceptual topics since there's a ton of content already out there already. We provide a guided path of how to build an app in the real world. Following this teaching style we quickly realized all of the courses within the Master Bundle requires knowledge of advanced patterns which aren't covered anywhere online. We decided that we would have to create advanced content so we have something to point to as reference. We started by creating a Router course abd ab Advanced Components courses only to combine them into one course as Advanced. Right now anyone who bought the Master Bundle gets everything for free until we finish the courses. So that means everyone will get the complete path to becoming an expert at Angular 2. This is different from content release right now which doesn't provide a path because it simply takes more thought to create. We're also providing real world advanced patterns that leads to expert. Also the introduction of NgModule dramatically changed the way we should be architecting our applications so previously we had a great plan and progression on how to guide users to becoming experts. After NgModule we first had to figure out new patterns that developers should be doing and figuring out the correct approach. Because of that huge change we had to regroup and delay the release. If you followed our Fundamentals course then you would know that it was right before NgModule

1159,2016-11-08 12:27:14,"Hi,

I meet this error when I try to build my app (npm run build) : 

> optimizationError in bail mode: [default] /node_modules/@types/core-js/index.d.ts:21:13 Duplicate identifier 'PropertyKey'.

I tried to remove from package.json the line ""typescript"": ""2.0.3"", because there was a conflict between this and ""@types/core-js"", but now the builder doesn't find my modules defined in ""src"" with aliases I defined.

> optimizationError in bail mode: [default] /server/backelite/odigo/front/src/app/app.component.ts:3:28
> Cannot find module 'services/user.service'

The root ""service"" is aliased (to avoid `import ../../services/user.service` for exemple)

> var path = require('path');
> 
> var utils_aliases = [
>     'app',

Here's my resolver in my webpack.config.js :

> var aliases = require('./aliases');

> config.resolve = {
>     // only discover files that have those extensions
>     extensions: ['.ts', '.js', '.json', '.css', '.scss', '.html'],
>     descriptionFiles: [""package.json""],
>     modules: [path.resolve(__dirname, 'src'), 'node_modules' ],
>     alias: aliases
> };

And the rules for typescript files : 

 

> var atlOptions = '';
>     if (isTest && !isTestWatch) {
>     // awesome-typescript-loader needs to output inlineSourceMap for code coverage to work with source maps.
>     atlOptions = 'inlineSourceMap=true&sourceMap=false';
>  }

> config.module = {
>     rules: [
>       // Support for .ts files.
>       {
>         test: /\.ts$/,
>         loaders: ['awesome-typescript-loader?' + atlOptions, 'angular2-template-loader', '@angularclass/hmr-loader'],

  3. add `import { Http } from '@angular/http';` in `app.component.ts` and call API inside `ngOnInit` as   below :

  4. serve application with `npm start` and visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in browser it will throw error TypeError: this.http.get(...).map is not a function in browser console


   Instead of serving with with `npm start` if i will first run `npm run build:aot` and then serve application with `npm run server:prod` then its running application and not throwing error `TypeError: this.http.get(...).map is not a function`

1147,2016-10-31 19:40:55,"Hi there,

I'm facing a strange issue using the AppState service provided in the starter kit.

I have a bootstrap component where I store an ID : 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

My Header component contains some router navigation links that display some other subcomponents in the router outlet. I didn't want to pass my folderId in each of these subcomponents with property binding, so I thought it was a good idea to use the AppState service like a registry.

My subcomponents simply look like : 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

But I have this error: 

`Error: Uncaught (in promise): TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON(…)`

not on the first subcomponent loading, but when I click on the nav links to switch on another one, hence when the next subcomponent is loaded.
Is it me who use the AppService the wrong way ?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of angular2-template-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

  bug
- **What is the current behavior?**
  Npm (v2) fails to install node modules. Npm (both v2 and v3) fails to shrinkwrap.

1. checkout latest master (currently d6c2afa440394)
2. run ""npm install"" (npm v2)

or
2. run ""npm install"" (npm v3) - you will get some warnings

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
1. run ""npm shrinkwrap""

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
- **What is the expected behavior?**
  At least ""npm shrinkwrap"" should work for npm v3.
  It's desirable ""npm install"" should work for npm v2 too.
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
  Unfortunately, I can't upgrade npm to the v3 version, and I want to stop saving node_modules to the my sources/git, so I need to make ""npm install"" works for the npm v2 version.

Thank you for the wonderful starter project! 

It would be really great if you could help me with the following issue, as it can cause a lot of troubles on a real production environment. 
The issue is with long-term caching of static assets and lazy loaded modules.
Reproducible on windows and Linux machines. Here are the steps:
1. clone the repository, run `npm install` and `npm run build:prod`
2. copy dist folder and save it somewhere to be able to compare old content with newly generated later
3. modify Lazy-loaded component (src\app+detail\detail.component.ts) somehow (change console.log statement for instance). 
4. run `npm run build:prod` again
5. compare folders with any diff tool. Here are my results

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13537012/19752979/f13e4638-9c09-11e6-899a-9cb8c6a6a3cc.png)

The only difference is in polyfills commons chunk:

For some reason, chunkhash for polyfills chunk is not changed although content is different. 

Appreciate any help.

1133,2016-11-21 08:22:51,"@katallaxie, maybe I didn't explain the issue properly. Indeed, polyfills content isn't changed in this case. But reference map is changed. And this map happens to be stored inside polyfills file with current webpack configuration. 
Anyway, I don't expect this to be fixed as part of starter project. This is a webpack-related bug. To be precise it is webpack-md5-hash bug (erm0l0v/webpack-md5-hash#7). 
To overcome the issue I decided to use [hash] instead of [chunkhash] for webpack output. Obviously it will force clients to invalidate each module after application release/build. But it is better than not invalidating content at all and it is temporary solution while the bug isn't fixed.

First of all. The problem why it was occurring was due to this line in the sassLoader

`result.map.sources[0] = path.relative(self.options.context, resourcePath);`

Here, the following object was always null.

Even if I passed the context in Webpack.common.config, it was still null.

So finally, correct way of doing is,

Add the following in the respective config files and not the webpack.common.config

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of copy-webpack-plugin.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

[GitHub Release](https://github.com/kevlened/copy-webpack-plugin/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

<p>This is a rewrite to add several new features.</p>


<h3>Features</h3>


<ul>
<li>Debug mode can be enabled with 3 options: <code>warning</code> (default), <code>info</code>, or <code>debug</code>.</li>
<li>Transform method can modify the contents of a file before writing it.</li>
<li>Warn on missing file or directory. Use the <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/webpack/docs/wiki/list-of-plugins#noerrorsplugin"">NoErrorsPlugin</a> if you want this to fail the build.</li>
<li>Allow name templates in <code>to</code> paths, like webpack's <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/webpack/file-loader"">file-loader</a>.</li>
<li>Improved performance by reading files concurrently. Before, we used Bluebird's <code>each()</code> to process files, now we use <code>map()</code>. The <code>concurrency</code> option is exposed if you'd like to override the default of 100 parallel files.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bug fixes</h3>


<ul>
<li>Allow graceful-fs to patch EMFILE/ENFILE issues. <code>fs.readFileSync</code> isn't used to load file contents into webpack's compilation.assets anymore.</li>
<li>Handle edge case for webpack-dev-server where absolute <code>to</code> couldn't be written.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Breaking changes</h3>


<ul>
<li>Ignore globs also ignore dotted files by default.</li>
</ul>

  Feature Request
- **What is the current behavior?**
  Import statements in entry points for CSS and SASS are not currently working,
- **What is the expected behavior?**
  Adding an Import statement in any of the entry points (IE Vendor) for a SASS (.scss) or a CSS (.css) file should result in that stylesheet being bundled into the global css for the application.
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
  Some modules, such as Bootstrap V4, require stylesheets to be imported into the application to enable certain features, such as the flex grid. There are current workarounds in place, but they are bulky and bloated. This method of importing stylesheets used to work in the original builds of this seed project.\*

1121,2016-10-27 01:49:54,"@CharlieGreenman - This would be something that belongs on a fork of the `angular2-webpack-starter`. My suggestion would be to go the route that NathanWalker went with https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular-seed-advanced

Not everyone wants / needs something like ngrx.

As an aside, professionally I run a heavily modified version of the webpack-starter with ngrx / scss & a few other goodies. If you were interested in maintaining a feature fork for ngrx, i'd certainly be up for contributing to it.
",d3viant0ne,2016-10-27 01:49:54
1121,2016-10-27 03:40:57,"Ok. I was thinking of contributing to https://github.com/qdouble/angular-webpack2-starter. However, https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular-seed-advanced does seem to be better off for this stage in things. It's just that angular2-seed-advanced is too jammed pack, with Electron/Nativescript in particular. I'll take my reservations over to [angular2-seed-advanced](https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular-seed-advanced) if need be. 
",CharlieGreenman,2016-10-27 01:49:54
1121,2016-10-27 05:16:12,"@CharlieGreenman  I wasn't necessarily suggesting you contribute to a different repo. 

To be clear, I was suggesting you create a fork of this repo and modify it to run ngrx as an example / base seed for those that want to get into redux.

Nathan's advanced seed is great but it's based on SystemJS, if you want to use Webpack ( my personal choice ) that is going to be a big change. I've looked at the `angular-webpack2-starter` it's solid work but imho it's a bit cluttered for my taste.

In the end I personally forked this repo & added ngrx, scss & material2 and it's maintained independently at this point.

1121,2016-10-27 15:47:41,"Hey @d3viant0ne , I actually did realize that! I also realized after writing what
I should mention it, but was caught up at the time :) 

That being said, would you be interested in open sourcing the your personal repo that has ngrx and scss. I would be more than interested in maintaining. Regardless, I am going to go ahead and create a ngrx/scss version of this repo. Thank you.

Increase VM memory and use NFS shared folder. Details can be found here https://stefanwrobel.com/how-to-make-vagrant-performance-not-suck.

Increasing the amount of inotify watchers (https://github.com/guard/listen/wiki/Increasing-the-amount-of-inotify-watchers):
`echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf ; sudo sysctl -p`

Then I still had remnants of previous failures probably, because I had to do an npm cache clean as well.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

  Bug.

  I cloned this project and it works. So I searched a way to use  `scss` instead of `css`, then I followed  this [tutorial](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-include-SCSS-in-components) and modify the extension to `scss` and, of course, in styleUrls. however I'm still receiving a bug:

The release notes for v5.0.5 are misleading. The release notes show:

>  v5.0.5 - 52b4d4e
> Title: Angular 2
> @katallaxie katallaxie released this on Sep 2 · 35 commits to master since this release
> 
> @angular/*-2.0.0

The above suggests that the latest version (5.0.5) is on Angular 2.0.0, but taking a look at the package.json file, angular is still only on RC6. A long away off 2.0.0.

Manually updating package.json to 2.0.0 or 2.1.0 has no effect due to npm shrinkwrap forcing it back down to RC6.

1. Can the release notes be updated to be clear that this is NOT 2.0.0, but it is RC6. Or if the chosen commit for that tag was incorrect, and it should be 2.0.0, can the tag be updated.
2. The code in master is on angular 2.0.0, but using latest master (039deb5) causes other dependancy warnings. What is the most stable 2.0.0 commit, if there is one. Is perhaps the 2.1.0 branch more stable/ready yet?
3. What are the pros/cons/reasons one would need/want to continue to use the angular class starter kit over doing webpack yourself. I like the starter kit, but having this dependancy in the middle preventing us from using the latest released version of angular is causing an issue for us. If someone could outline the pros and cons of not using the starter kit, that would be appreciated, to help decide the best course of action.

_Note: I took out all the other questions in the template bug report, as this does not apply to a specific environment, and is a question about the repo/code in general. Can provide the info if needed._

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ts-helpers.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

  [X] question about the decisions made in the repository
- **What is the current behavior?**

When I use a image as a background for a css class, i place the image in the assets folder and the image is displayed fine on the browser. The problem occurs with the images not showing when I generate the dist files, place the generated dist files on a CDN like Akamai and access the dist files from my JBoss application. 

If my application url is jboss.com and the dist files of all the js files and my images (assets) are placed in say akamai.com, the css being served well, but since the css is part of the main.bundle.js and loaded on the DOM, it is attempting to load the image from jboss.com instead of from akamai.com. 

Only if I load the css directly on the head without including it as a StyleUrl in the Angular2 component, it will actually look for the image in the CDN and render it on the application. 

P.S: I currently have the ViewEncapsulation set to NONE.
- **What is the expected behavior?**

Expected behavior should be the image should load from the CDN. 
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

To not place static resources like the images in the application server and serve them from a CDN.

If this were my issue, I would probably use ts-md5 as a starting point if portions of it are viable, include it in a shared module ( faster for developing ) and stick a comment at the top referencing the original repo. Once it's current & in good working order, PR it back to the original repo or publish a new package if the owner doesn't respond.

1089,2016-11-08 01:15:23,"@katallaxie , it looks like [this commit](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/commit/7bfba744ebfa77c5dfb30524e639e394a1d92c0e#diff-f737fedb5357468044db2dbe98eb0218L39) moved the `metadata` property from the root of the config object into the  `HtmlWebpackPlugin` in `webpack.common.js` however other features relay on it for useful information (i.e: it's not only for the HtmlWebpackPlugin). Github pages is one but also [webpack.dev.js#23](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/config/webpack.dev.js#L23)  and [webpack.prod.js#27](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/config/webpack.prod.js#L27) assume it's there.

I will duplicate the `metadata` property in `webpack.common.js` to be both on root object and in `HtmlWebpackPlugin` for now to restore order.

However, some refactoring is needed since the logical process is wrong.
`HtmlWebpackPlugin` is set in `webpack.common.js` but a user might want to alter some values in dev/prod... 

It's not for this topic but I think common should have a pre process callback that can get the (almost) final config object and do some work such as adding plugins etc using updated/final objects.

I think an issue is needed for this, for now I will just duplicate to restore github pages functionality.
",shlomiassaf,2016-11-22 14:25:28
1089,2016-11-08 01:26:36,"Here's a great example of why we need to pre process in common.

The GitHub pages feature requires some changes in the `HtmlWebpackPlugin.
Since GitHub pages sites have a URL path prefixed with the repo's name it must be set as the base url (e.g: angularclass.github.io/**angular2-webpack-starter**). Most (if not all) projects does not care about GitHub pages so the configuration is usually set so the app is in the domain's root (e.g: www.example.com/).

the GitHub pages feature must be transparent so it need to be able to set the configuration values of `HtmlWebpackPlugin` which is not possible (cleanly) at the moment.
",shlomiassaf,2016-11-22 14:25:28
1089,2016-11-08 02:30:51,"OK, issue fixed without changing `webpack.common.js`
However, relaying on HtmlWebpackPlugin API 

Also added a workaround for a bug in GH Pages after their move to Jekyll 3.3, this workaround must be reverted by people who use Jekyll in their GH pages.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of parse5.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Bug
- **What is the current behavior?**

Loading a custom Module from our sdk throws

zone.js:269 Uncaught Error: Unexpected value '[object Object]' imported by the module 'AppModule'
- **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via

This is the custom Module in our SDK.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

loading it in app.module.ts throws the error above, which seems to originate from missing the @NgModule Decorator. The SDK works fine in ng2-admin from akveo which is build on the angular2-webpack-starter. If I comment out the @NgModule Decorator, then ng2-admin also throws the same error, hence the suspicion that somehow it gets lost during (maybe) bundling.

Initialize sdk without error

I got an error when running `npm run start` command where my `app.component.ts` code have a number or declarations which tries to importing 3rd party's libraries, placed at outside of the `angular 2 webpack starter` project ( this arrangement is based on the Angular 2 sample app they suggested to us where the sample still use webpack v.1.13.0).

Looking at the errors message, it seems that current `Angular 2 webpack starter` is unable to load/link/ the `.ttf` files residing inside the 3rd party library (`common` folder). I have not much knowledge on how to configure the webpack in `Angular 2 webpack starter` to resolve this issue. Could you guys suggest me any resolutions to solve this issue ?

  [ ] question about the decisions made in the repository
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
  Been having lots of issues finding the right build configuration for pre-compiling sass/scss using this starter project. Anything that does work seems to have very slow performance.

Currently, the project I am working on, has a main.scss file that imports several others assets including other scss files, fonts from font-awesome, and since bootstrap-sass is in the project it also has to declare $icon-font-path: ""~bootstrap-sass/assets/fonts/bootstrap/"";

Seems like my implementation is very slow 90s + for a build or rebuild and I suspect it is because of the css and scss source maps. example:

`{
                test: /\.scss$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                loaders: ['style', 'css?sourceMap', 'resolve-url', 'sass?sourceMap']
            },`

I am sure other people are trying to include scss files in their projects based on this starter and so it would be nice if possible to see a performant example of how to do this with the starter.

1062,2016-10-07 22:57:03,"Here's how I got Sass working with Hot Module Replacement in my app. 
- In dev mode, Hot Module Replacement is enabled for Sass
- In production mode, all styles are extracted into an external .css file - to prevent ""flash"" of unstyled content and allow caching of css.

My loader for SCSS - works fast and easy

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
- `sass-vars-loader` allows you to load a JS file with exported variables, then import them into every scss file.
- `sass-resources` loads up a specified array of .scss files, and prepends them before every .scss file is compiled. Useful for appwide variables and mixins.
- `postcss` allows you to do lots of cool stuff, like autoprefix classes with vendor prefixes.

Here's how to specify the options for each of those loaders

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This is where `sassVarsConfig` is defined:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Here's how to setup the `sass-js-variables.js`

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Lastly, instead of using angular2's `styleUrls` or `styles` properties of the @Component decorator, I opt to do it like this instead:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I import the scss outside of the @Component decorator. Why? Because this way I get Hot Module Replacement to work on my .scss files, and it allows my styles to apply globally. I then simply namespace my .scss files with the selector for each specific component, which creates an encapsulated style to prevent it from affecting other components:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

That's it.  [Here's my repo](https://github.com/IAMtheIAM/angular2-webpack2-dotnet-starter) which is a fork of this repo, that shows all this off in action. (Note: its using .NET core to host the app, so you'll need .NET Core SDK installed in order to run it)

- **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**

Report a bug
- **What is the current behavior?**

Module paths with import { Something } from 'custom_modules/things';
Cannot be resolved with webpack as the module cannot be resolved. 
- **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
  https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).

Import any module with the module method. I.e. Not absolute or relative paths.
- **What is the expected behavior?**

Webpack should resolve module based imports.
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

It is a part of webpack that is supported, yet the config does not work with.
- **Please tell us about your environment:**
- Angular version: 2.0.0-beta.X
- Browser: [all | Chrome XX | Firefox XX | IE XX | Safari XX | Mobile Chrome XX | Android X.X Web Browser | iOS XX Safari | iOS XX UIWebView | iOS XX WKWebView ]
- **Other information** (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)

This can be fixed by changing the resolve: area in webpack.common.js from using root: and modulesDirectories to just using the new config option 'modules' This is the new way for webpack 2.0 that package.json now points to.

        helpers.root('src'),

                    url: XXXXXX,
                    enableCookies: true,

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of typescript.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Hi, 

I was wondering what the preloader on .ts files to use the `string-replace-loader` would be used for in a project.  I'm not an expert in javascript/the module ecosystem by any means, but this is what I think that part does:
- node, commonjs, amd, systemjs all have different ways that they resolve/import javascript modules
- this checks your code in case you have a module that is targeted toward a systemjs runtime (I'm shaky on what this actually entails/if you can use it in tandem with other types of modules)
- it replaces the `import` to import the module then does..... something.

I'd appreciate if anyone could clarify this.  If this is more suited to StackOverflow or a Slack channel somewhere, please let me know and I will close this issue.

Hello - I am not sure is this is a bug or not. I am new to Webpack HMR.
- **What is the current behavior?**

I am trying to add a Core module to the seed repo and import it into the main App Root Module. However I get an error when loading the app at `bootloader( main );` in `main.browser.ts` I know this must be related to HMR.
- **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
  https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).

I am following the Angular Style Guide and an app that John Papa has as an example of using a core module. The repo is here:

[https://github.com/johnpapa/event-view/tree/master/src/app/core](url)
- **What is the expected behavior?**

I was hoping for some direction on how to load more then one NgModule into the app.
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

To separate my app out by feature, and only load components for modules that need them.

This is more of a general question on git + Angular2 development practice with this starter. How should one keep angular2-webpack-starter code up to date when you start commiting your own app code to pulled repository? I've never used a 'starter' code before from another repository to build my app on top of it so I'm wondering how to keep commiting your own app code and keep pulling all new updates of angular2-webpack-starter's code?

1024,2016-09-20 19:40:03,"Hi guys,

I am creating a sample application in angularjs 2.0. While developement I came across with a serious problem - I can't inject anything to the component through the constructor function.

I used the following code for importing ItemService from app.item.service.ts
`import { ItemService } from './app.item.service';`

Then I specified provider as 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

After that, given code for TodoComponent as

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

When I try to inject ItemService through constructor , I am getting an error : "" Error: Can't resolve all parameters for TodoComponent: (?).""
I am not able to inject even angularjs providers like Injector.

However, this method works for me  : 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I am using the following versions of libraries for developement as mentioned in my package.json

  [x ] question about the decisions made in the repository

The readme states ""We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic.""

However, RC6 removed @Component.directives (deprecated in a previous RC) which indicates to me that the angular team is supporting a module pattern. it doesn't really make sense to add a bunch of declarations in your `app.module.ts` that won't be used by the entire app, but only by specific components. this might be a weak example, but `home` uses the `x-large` directive but `about` may never need to have the ability to use that directive.

Does this make sense or am I misunderstanding the Angular team's intentions?

1022,2016-09-21 18:01:57,"Well, regardless of what the README refers to, my question is about switching to a pattern that uses NgModule more heavily.

Instead of having app module declare home component and x-large directive, using a module pattern there would be an app module and a home module. The home module would have declarations for the home component and x-large directive.

  [ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

Trying to install a dependency (imdb-api) https://www.npmjs.com/package/imdb-api

I have installed imdb-api, and can see it in my node-modules.
Using the newest webpack.

My package json file looks like this:
**package.json file**
    ""ie-shim"": ""^0.1.0"",
    ""imdb-api"": ""^2.0.0"",
    ""rxjs"": ""5.0.0-beta.12"",
    ""zone.js"": ""~0.6.17""

Then In a component, I have tried to import it or require it, but none seem to work.

**What i have tried:**
import { imdb } from 'imdb-api';
then made a console.log(imdb); in the constructor. 

and

var imdb = require('imdb-api');
console.log(imdb) in the constructor. 

All this gives alot of errors which I can google myself to. Have tried imdb-api in another solution (not webpack) and here it works.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of istanbul-instrumenter-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

1004,2016-09-19 12:40:28,"Hi @randyangeles,

If you are trying to setup routes you need to provide the routes in your import and unless I am mistaken importing RouterTestingModule takes care of mocking Router for you.  You would need to do something like the following:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

You can then create routes to actual or mock components within your test.  In my case the routing is really simple (I really only use routing to make it easy to get info from the URL and for future support) so I actually removed the routing and only include the core import at the moment.

Take a look at the documentation (which unfortunately still appears to be a work in progress) for more information (https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/router/testing/index/RouterTestingModule-class.html).

Hope this helps!

Just saw your post.  As I mentioned to @randyangeles, I don't think you should be mocking the router rather use the withRoutes function when importing RouterTestingModule.  That way you can route to either your actual components or to mock components.  My hope is that using this approach we will be less susceptible to framework changes going forward.

Hope that helps!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of protractor.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

[ ] feature request
[ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

Hello,
The problem appears when application runs in subfolder. In index.html icons try to load from main folder.
In file head-config.common.js all urls of icons starts with '/assets
example:
    { rel: 'icon', type: 'image/png', sizes: '16x16', href: '/assets/icon/favicon-16x16.png' },
I think it should be:
    { rel: 'icon', type: 'image/png', sizes: '16x16', href: './assets/icon/favicon-16x16.png' },

Tested on Chrome.

This issue is caused by webpack being unhappy with dynamic imports. The Webpack team states that this is by design:
https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/212#issuecomment-242449586

Are the dynamic `System.import` calls (as called out above on lines 45 and 57) absolutely necessary? Having to shut off a highly recommended piece of webpack feels hacky.

Need some guide how use this starter pack with components in header.
Wiki chapters like ""How to use Bootstrap 4 and Sass (and jQuery)"" is outdated.
And big question for beginners is ""How to include vendor styles like css styles or other css""

Nice! 

I then go to host the site through the Github gh-pages branch. My project is named ""SafeFoods"" and gh-pages adds an extra _SafeFoods_ into the path here in the address bar. The problem with this is that I have files looking to be loaded at a path that doesn't have _SafeFoods_ (but is otherwise identical).

I have tried changing ""baseUrl"" in the webpack.common.js file, but this breaks the site when I run the dev server and prod server!

Does anyone know how I can make it so that the site works in all three situations?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of protractor.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

(2) That is automatically transform Component Metadata to `require`statements, to Hot Module Reloading, and have async components. So, a lot of stuff that is hard to have in the CLI as you have to have a lot of boilerplate code.

968,2016-10-24 02:11:20,"### Considering becoming an Angular CLI template or using @ngtools/webpack

With the Angular CLI becoming so powerful and central to workflow, it's a good time to consider if this starter makes sense to work as an Angular CLI template. See ""[App Creation Using Template](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/Stories#app-creation-using-template)"" in the CLI wiki. Becoming a template would look something like this for a user to get started:

`ng new my-ng2-app --template=angular2-webpack-starter`

Or adopting [`@ngtools/webpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/~ngtools) to not miss out on any of the innovations happening on the CLI like ""code splitting"" (see below) and other optimizations. 

See the benefits and ability to use `@ngtools/webpack` standalone from the Angular CLI as presented in [Stephen Fluin's Angular CLI talk](https://youtu.be/uBRK6cTr4Vk?t=6m45s) at Angular Connect 2016:

- TypeScript transpilation
- Bundles JavaScript, CSS
- Asset optimization
- Virtual filesystem for assets
  - For serving local assets and compile versions.
- Live-reload via websockets
- Code splitting
  - Recognizing the use of loadChildren in the router, and bundling those modules separately so that any dependencies of those modules are not going to be loaded as part of your main bundle. These separate bundles will be pulled out of the critical path of your application, making your total application bundle much smaller and loading it much more performant.

The change would also include AoT,  DLL only for dev and SCSS (since it's the most popular one). Anything the CLI has will be included plus more depending on the opinions and style guide of @AngularClass. The only problem right now is finding the weekend to work on it or start training maintainers for future updates. The CLI and starter repos have different goals which is why this repo will always exist.

  [x] question about the decisions made in the repository
- **Question:**

Since the release of RC5 and `NgModule`, you are using `System.import` to load modules asynchronously. I was just wondering why. Since we are using webpack, is it redundant to have SystemJS ?
- **Please tell us about your environment:**

Angular version: 2.0.0-rc.5

",luchillo17,2016-09-09 04:05:55
967,2016-09-08 16:35:02,"Do not confuse `System.import` with SystemJS. `System.import` is to have dynamic `imports` and SystemJS is the Polyfill to allow to do this today. `System.import` is using ES6 promises, so not much different then what `es6-promise-loader` does. See [here](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html)
",katallaxie,2016-09-09 04:05:55
967,2016-09-08 18:02:20,"That does make sense, instead of depending on that loader is best to rely on SystemJS to polyfill the `System.import` that JS is supposed to have in the future, basically getting ready for the future hoping some day we could drop the SystemJS library used to polyfill the import.

@katallaxie Is that right?
",luchillo17,2016-09-09 04:05:55
967,2016-09-08 19:15:50,"No, I think there are 2 things with the same name : SystemJS.

On one hand, there is the SystemJS that we all know - the module loader - and on the other hand there is the module loader API for ES6, the one we are using here.

I heard about it but I didn't know that they have the same name.

_ I'm not sure but that is what I understand._
",mildful,2016-09-09 04:05:55
967,2016-09-08 19:28:52,"@mildful SystemJS wants to harvest the same mechanism as `System.import` will do. Dynamically load modules. They provide an API based on `Promise`, which is polyfilled, that emulates this of `System.import`. What SystemJS and Webpack do in addition, is to produce these modules. So, the goal of SystemJS is, to have `System.import` work today, in all browsers, and to have the modules produced.
",katallaxie,2016-09-09 04:05:55
967,2016-09-09 00:46:46,"So it is in deed working as a polyfill in this context.
",luchillo17,2016-09-09 04:05:55
967,2016-09-09 04:05:55,"We are using the keywords `System.import` but it's not related to SystemJS since it's inlined as promises. Webpack 2 gives us this new promise base syntax which allows us to use that rather than our callback style syntax workaround wrapper (`es6-promise-loader`) `require.ensure`. Also, note that SystemJS uses the `SystemJS` global now to be backwards compatible with the future browser loader spec. See [guybedford/systemjs-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/guybedford/systemjs-webpack-plugin) that will allow SystemJS and Webpack to work together.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of css-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

  [X] bug report
  [ ] feature request
  [ ] question about the decisions made in the repository
- **What is the current behavior?**
  The recent update of this repo includes the great addition to debug the app with VSCode out of the box. 
  Unfortunately we need the dev server to serve the site from HTTPS domain because
- we authorize the user via OAuth2 / OpenId connect 
- our backend server only allow (authorized) connections via HTTPS / TLS 
  To serve the app via SSL I added the `--https` flag to the startup flags of the WebPack dev server and added the following startup script to the `package.json` file.

`""server:dev:ssl"": ""npm run server:dev -- --https""`

With that change the login and the API calls work, but unfortunately the debugging from Visual Studio doesn't work anymore.

The output in the console is the following:

`›SourceMaps.loadSourceMapContents: Could not download sourcemap from https://localhost:3000/polyfills.map
  ›SourceMaps.loadSourceMapContents: Could not download sourcemap from https://localhost:3000/polyfills.bundle.js.map
  ›SourceMaps.loadSourceMapContents: Could not download sourcemap from https://localhost:3000/vendor.map
  ›SourceMaps.loadSourceMapContents: Could not download sourcemap from https://localhost:3000/vendor.bundle.js.map
  ›SourceMaps.loadSourceMapContents: Could not download sourcemap from https://localhost:3000/main.map
  ›SourceMaps.loadSourceMapContents: Could not download sourcemap from https://localhost:3000/main.bundle.js.map`

My first thought was that i missed a config or something and that the sourcemaps may be still served from http://localhost and not from https://localhost.
So I checked the Urls and it seams that the maps are generated correct. 
In the browser the requested URLs
- https://localhost:3000/polyfills.map
- https://localhost:3000/vendor.map
- https://localhost:3000/main.map
  returns the sourcemaps correctly from https.

To further debug the issue i enabled the VSCode Chrome Debuggers diagnostic loging feature via the following addition in the config file for the debugger ( `.vscode/launch.json`). 

`""diagnosticLogging"": true,`

Unfortunately with no new hints that could help to solve the issue.
I can post the logs if it somewhat helps.

As a side note: 
When I debug in Chrome the breakpoints are hit correctly (although not in my current project which is not updated to Webpack 2 yet, but it works with the current master) 
- **What is the expected behavior?**
  That the breakpoints are also hit within VSCode with https enabled
- **Please tell us about your environment:**
- latest master
- node v 6.3
- npm 3.10.3
- Tested on Mac OSX 10.10.5 and Windows 10 (without the anniversary update)
- Angular RC6
- Browser: all
- Webpack 1 (OSX) and Webpack 2(Win)
- **Other information** (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)

I am not sure if it is an issue of this repo or webpack dev server or the chrome debugger or that I made something wrong with the configuration (still learning webpack).
Because I think that this is a common requirement (use https) I hope that someone has also run into this issue which can help to solve the issue.
I also think that the https extension would be a good addition to this great repo.

Removing all module.id's fixed the issue!.
I used a theme I bought and it seems they had those left somewhere so i removed it and it **worked**!.

  my app works correctly in development server, but when i try to run it in production

it generates errors in the web console, complaining about my components,
like this:

`The pipe 'translate' could not be found`

  [ ] question about the decisions made in the repository
- **What is the current behavior?**
  Currently you have to start the app server and protractor from separate terminals.
  This makes it difficult to run the protractor tests from a Maven build.
- **What is the desired behavior?**
  Have the server and protractor started from Maven directly.
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
  Run CI tests directly from Maven in an integration server, e.g. Jenkins.
- **Please tell us about your environment:**
  Latest version of this project as of 2016/09/02.
  Using Maven Plugin:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

CI is run under Linux, development is under Windows.
- **Other information**

I found an npm package called concurrently [https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently](url).
I added the following to package.json:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Works like a charm!!
",workasr,
950,2016-09-08 16:13:29,"That is a good one. Another way on Windows environment is to prefix any command with `start`

Example: `start npm run appserver & start npm run protractor`

This will launch both programs in a new console window, on a different thread that isn't connected to each other. Works for free without any extra packages :-)

The use of a single `&` tells the command to not wait for the previous command to finish before starting the new one, meaning it runs both simultaneously.

However, on linux it will require some changes, one potential is to use previx `xdg-open` before the commands in place of `start`. This would require running 2 different commands since you have 2 environments.

The `concurrently` program might be the easiest way to handle multi environment commands.

  [X] question about the decisions made in the repository

@katallaxie

While the enthusiasm is great, just slamming home changes without others having the opportunity to vet those changes kind of defeats the point of `community` & `code review`. 30 Commits directly to master, to include those to fix or remove features that shouldn't have landed between 27 Sept & 01 Aug.

It also means that everyone that uses the webpack-starter as a base project has to pick up those changes and merge them into what is usually a modified project, it gets tedious quickly.

I'm suggesting you start delivering changes as `complete, tested & vetted sets of work` through the standard `pull request` workflow that everyone else uses thus making the update process less labor intensive and less prone to blowing up peoples forks (which happened to me last week). 

`Landing your own code` is generally `frowned upon` and for good reason. A second ( or multiple ) sets of eyes is never, ever a bad thing.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of parse5.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

",HansS,2016-09-02 11:29:23
938,2016-08-31 19:53:20,"Hey @HansS sorry we weren't more transparent and thanks for purchasing the Master Bundle. We have the courses on a new schedule that is not reflected on the website and the order might change up a bit. This is mostly due to fit Angular 2's release which is very soon and due to the recent changes in `2.0.0-rc.5`. We thought it would be better if we recreate the courses using the new approach after Angular 2 is released. The delay of the reactive course is mostly my fault going back and forth with @Hendrixer on if we should teach our new reactive architecture that we have, or to use the [angular2-observe-decorators](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-observe-decorators), or to focus only on reactivity and state management (our original plan). We were also thinking about if we should teach more RxJS or move that into the Modern JavaScript course or provide that as a mini-course. We decided to stick with our original plan because the observe-decorators is teaching a new way to manage your app with my own proposed spec that might change if it's merged with the Angular codebase. Our new reactive architecture has all of the features that everyone is talking about (rxjs, redux, sagas, effects) plus a ton of features that no-one is talking about (past/present/future states, interop, priority rendering, isolated loops, hot module replacement, webworkers, universal) and would need a few more iterations to unify the whole story. A lot of sugar is needed before we release it to make the API more intuitive and will most likely be a free course.

937,2016-08-31 13:03:32,"Hey guys,
We are currently trying to create native apps from our angular2 webpack starter created projects.

Is there an easy way to create an app from the webpack starter for iOS/Android, that behaves like the browser web app? (same but with fullscreen mode). 

It doesn't have to be nativescript, if there exists another possibility like Ionic 2.. Maybe somebody has good experiences with it.

NativeScript 2.x has moved to the same approach as ReactNative; which is to use JavaScript to wrap around the native frameworks. So, you have decide if you want to go with the Ionic approach, or the other. I would highly recommend second. There is a new an interesting project https://github.com/angular/react-native-renderer which essentially uses Angular 2 on the JavaScript UI Control Thread.

The jQuery plugin trying to load the jQuery instance from jQuery folder that placed inside the plugin (node_modules/jquery...). My main jQuery version is 3.1.0 but the plugin trying to load jQuery which is version 1.11.0

Here my configuration
`webpack.common.js`

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

`component.ts`

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Then i got the error in the browser console
`$(...).vectorMap is not a function`
It's because the jQuery instance between main module and the plugin are difference

How can i resolve this?

**Update 1:**
Tried to add more alias and use imports-loader to import jQuery to the plugin
alias: `'jq': require.resolve('jquery')`
import jQuery in `component.ts`: `require('imports?jQuery=jq!jqvmap')`
Then do `require('jq') in the jQuery plugin`. It's says `Cannot find module ""jq""`

Update 2:
Kind of hacks and i dont like this way
This code will inject `var jQuery = require('./../../jquery')` into the plugin to make it load the same jquery with the webpack
`require('imports?jQuery=./../../jquery!jqvmap');`

I don't think any updates are needed for this, since if you want to use ES7 features on your code, you have to set the ""lib"" version in tsconfig.json (and tsconfig.webpack.json) to ""es7"".

So I can't see any issues on Angular2 webpack starter or Angular2 itself regarding this. Just set the library version you want, and you are good to go.

This issue should be closed, or maybe the default library setting should be changed to ES7.",rvalimaki,

924,2016-08-29 18:53:28,"Hi,

don't know if its the right place to ask here but I'm 
trying to get this repo work with bootstrap 4 mixins.

I followed the wiki bootstrap 4 guide and everything
looks good.

But if I have an component for instance 

**home.component.ts**

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

and **home.style.scss**

`@include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
    .dosomething {
         padding: 0px;
    }
}`

I get 'No mixin named media-breakpoint-up'.

If i add the following line to **home.style.scss**
it works. But I don't know it it's the right thing todo.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

So is it possible to inject _breakpoints.scss (mixins) and _variables.scss 
global or if its needed? Shouldn't webpack handle this case?

Regards
",regenrek,
924,2016-08-29 18:57:26,"I got this to work by importing `@import ""../../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap-grid.scss"";` instead of the breakpoints directly. The Bootstrap-Grid file does include the breakpoints along with other pieces. 
",jshamley,
924,2016-08-29 19:05:07,"@jshamley True. Thank you. bootstrap-grid.scss looks better. But you need still manually import the scss files right? Where do you import the scss - in every component where you need the mixins or globally (maybe in app.styles?)

924,2016-08-29 19:07:17,"@regenrek I have been importing them per component SCSS file. I have only needed those mixins a couple times so far so I didn't take the time to import globally.
",jshamley,
924,2016-08-29 19:12:53,"A bit off topic: but you can use all the `import` Sass files with module syntax by prefixing it with `~` `import ""~boostrap/scss/bootstrap-grid.scss""`.

",regenrek,
924,2016-08-29 19:27:11,"@regenrek check the path, this was just an example. https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader#imports

Also `includePaths` provides `node-sass` with a hint to resolve the `imports`. https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths

It is difficult to maintain mixins, as the the sass files are processed on the file entry. You could have something like a `facade.scss` that you could simply share.

908,2016-10-03 16:43:44,"@jussikinnula Thanks man, your repo helped my diagnose what was wrong with mine.

Turns out that `angular2-template-loader` cannot understand line comments inside of the routes object. During testing, I had a lot of variations commented out on one of my sub module routes, like this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

But that gives many errors. Just by removing the line comments, it fixed it:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

That was tricky to diagnose.

The second part of my fix was that on my typescript loader, I was using `'angular2-router-loader'`, but it never worked as expected. Then, I saw in your repo that you have `'angular2-router-loader?loader=system'`, so I tried it, and that did the trick!

So lessons: 
- add query `?loader=system` to `angular2-router-loader`
- don't use any line comments within routes object for sub modules loaded by `angular2-router-loader`

897,2016-08-26 21:35:43,"Semanic UI is a jQuery library, so you'll need to add this loader to your `webpack.common.js` file:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This exposes any jquery anytime it is require()'d to the global context.
Then, require jquery inside your `some.component.ts` file :

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

You'll need to redeclare the jQuery constant inside each component that will use jQuery. Its possible to refactor the jQuery require so you don't have to manually redeclare it in each component, but I have had unreliable results with that approach. Importing manually in each component is reliable so far.

You also need to add

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of protractor.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of css-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

I'm trying to add functionality from https://github.com/primefaces/primeng-quickstart-webpack into this project. However I'm stuck on how to include the css and images defined by primeng.

In the original project, the css's are added to the _index.html_ like this:

But I guess I need to use the https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy-webpack-plugin to make sure the css and images are copied to '**assets**'.

However, I think it is not correct to load them in the head either way. Personally I do not load vendor libaries that way because you have webpack at your command. Rather that making all those network requests, just bundle the library into your `vendor.ts` webpack bundle.

Small implementation details aside, the only really viable way to get AoT working in a meaningful way would be the route @qdouble took. Kind of wish I would have seen his starter prior to doing all that work myself :/ as we ended up in a similar place.

_**If the intent is to get AoT into this starter sooner rather than later,  qdouble/angular-webpack2-starter would be the path forward.**_ 

That said, there are some pretty significant challenges with AoT once you grow your application to anything of production size. `AoT is a commitment to building in a specific way`, most of which won't be apparent with the small starter application. For instance, anyone using Sass in the normal fashion of using require statements in components for styles are going to have a lot of work to do. 

If we are going to land AoT now, everyone should be ready for the onslaught of questions and issues when people try to pull in AoT enabled #master and their builds explode ( been there ... lol ). 

Also worth noting, if we are going to release AoT support we definitely need to test the AoT builds for PRs or we are going to be breaking master every other day ( been there too ).

And I have no idea why should I be sending PRs while you already have a a branch with all the `other stuff` I'm talking about.",fxck,2016-12-27 12:01:43

885,2017-01-07 07:21:12,"@shlomiassaf geez, DLLs are not even the point. The point was that there is a branch of **_THIS_** repo that already has both AOT and DLLs, is utilising @ngtools/webpack, is written a way more modern way, with all the configs being typesafe and written in typescript and all the while @AngularClass [team members](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/1330#issuecomment-270270806) and collaborators are being completely oblivious to the fact. I honestly couldn't care less, as I had to move to qdouble's starter couple of months ago because I simply couldn't proceed without AOT, but it seems like a wasted chance, time and effort to abandon that branch, unless there are reasons for it, which is what I kept asking for.",fxck,2016-12-27 12:01:43

885,2017-01-10 12:41:57,"Have you installed `@types/lodash`? Depending on what version of typescript you are running, you might need `types` in tsconfig as well, see https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html",fxck,2016-12-27 12:01:43
885,2017-01-10 12:46:29,"Oh thank you very much, it works just fine now @fxck !!",dttung-mario,2016-12-27 12:01:43
885,2017-01-10 16:53:09,"@fxck There is a branch with those but the fact that we waited led to better implementation :)

The current setup with AOT is better then `@ngtools`, this is until they catch up then we move back.
The router loader is solid, with AOT and absolute/alias path support.
We should have proper DLL integration without boilerplate in a day or two... 

Patience :)

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build kept failing**.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ts-node.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As zone.js is a direct dependency of this project **this is very likely breaking your project right now**. If other packages depend on you it’s very likely also breaking them.
I recommend you give this issue a very high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As typedoc is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

I am trying to use GSAP (http://greensock.com/) in angular2-webpack-starter
In the GSAP forum I found a ts typing file.

Any suggestions? Thanks

So to solve your problem, first look if there is a ""@types"" for GSAP.

Else, you can try to paste the content of you "".d.ts"" file in the ""custom-typings.d.ts"" of the Webpack Starter.

Didn't find much about @types and GSAP, don think they support it officially.
I tried moving the content from the .d.ts film to custom-typings. But it created some other issues.
But think I got GSAP to work without typings, so for now I will just do it this way.

But if somebody has experience with GSAP and angular2-webpack-starter please feel free to leave a comment.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ts-node.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As zone.js is a direct dependency of this project **this is very likely breaking your project right now**. If other packages depend on you it’s very likely also breaking them.
I recommend you give this issue a very high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

  I see error _Uncaught reflect-metadata shim is required when using class decorators_ on the JavaScript console.

One of my files is an AI player for a game and I want it to emit an event when it has decided its next move. So, I have this:

It was working until I added `public nextMove = new EventEmitter<number>();`. It then started giving this error in the browser's console: _connect-four-ai-player-worker-wrapper.ts?21e7:3 Uncaught reflect-metadata shim is required when using class decorators_

I checked #353 but couldn't relate to the exact same problem. Plus, I don't think I would have to change the Webpack configuration or import new packages just to use EventEmitter. So my guess is that something else is wrong and chances are it's user error  :-) Thanks in advance for your help!

Build works with Typescript 2.1.5 & ES5 Target BUT async/await doesn't work!

""__generator is not defined""

__generator is part of async/await code generated by Typescript when the target is ES5 or ES3.

Disabling UglifyJS completely allows production builds with ES6 target, so that's what I'm currently doing as a workaround.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of karma.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As codelyzer is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

And the fact that we have to declare all of our modules at start means we can't shard with webpack anymore, as far as I can tell.

There's a pretty big discussion on this on an issue on the angular repo, I don't have the link right now, but it's possible they will change a lot of these things before rc6.

I haven't implemented AoT compilation yet though.

As for RC6 - this will be a bugfix release, and a ""remove-deprecated-apis""-relelase.

If your app works with RC5 without warning messages deprecated use of APIs, it should be working out of the box with RC6... I'm pretty sure about this.

It showcases how to do shared modules, module routing.

I've provided a Docker-image so you don't have to install all those ugly global dependencies.

The repo is inspired by this repo, but I've simplified things: no testing, no deployment, no linting. I'm not saying you shouldn't do those things, but Angular has changed testing so much that I want to wait till the dust settles.  Also, Typescript2 has some issues with tslint.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of protractor.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Bug fix
- **What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)

Currently, when a background url(...) statement is used in CSS, webpack tries to incorrectly process the file reference as javascript. This causes a build error.
- **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**

Adding a file-loader to handle jpg/png/gif files fixes this.
- **Other information**:

Added use of file-loader for jpg/png/gif files. This adds support for using background url() statements in CSS files, as per https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/759

  Enhancement
- **What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)

Production configuration lets you configure host and port, but dev configuration does not. It defaults to localhost and port 3000.

Fixes issue:
https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/821
And partially:
https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/186
- **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**

Now to run dev server on a VM you can just run
PORT=8081 HOST=""0.0.0.0"" npm run server:dev:hmr
or if you're using ""forever""
PORT=8081 HOST=""0.0.0.0"" forever start -v --minUptime 1000 --spinSleepTime 1000 -c ""npm run server:dev:hmr"" ./
- **Other information**:

I'm using this to setup an automated Vagrant setup, and this way I can make all the changes in scripts instead of by hand. This also brings the dev config closer to the prod config.

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build kept failing**.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ts-node.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/pull/205)

Additionally I will have a node server running on the same machine and the same default port (3000). So I'd like to be able to change the port as well.
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

I can do this by hand of course, but I'm trying to get a full MEAN with Angular 2 set up via Vagrant, and I'd like to get it as automated as possible, so it can basically be a starter pack for people. I don't really wanna fork this starter since you guys are actively updating it.

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build kept failing**.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

- *\* Report a _bug_ **
- **What is the current behavior?**
  Git by defult treat directory 'tmp' in main directory as 'ignore'. But when I put to tmp copy of node_modules dir, then project was unable to compile in production mode. Because typescript thrown 'Duplication' problems (becouse it 'scan' tmp/node_modules dir...)

- **What is the expected behavior?**
  Ignore 'tmp' directory by typescript. We can do it by edit exclude section in tsconfig.json
  It should look like this:
  ...
  ""exclude"": [
    ""node_modules"",
    ""tmp""
  ],

  Reason of 'not compile in prod' error is not easy to findout and find solution it also not easy.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ts-node.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

[GitHub Release](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

<ul>
<li>In the latest of this love-hate relationship with TypeScript's <code>findConfigFile</code> method, I've completely reverted back to a saner version of <code>tsconfig</code> which replicates the same <code>tsc --project</code> interface (including error messages)</li>
</ul>

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

799,2016-07-21 20:42:06,"Hey guys,
- I have a project on which I've used this excellent starter as a base. Each time there are updates, I've updated my application - everything's been smooth.

But after updating to Typescript2.0 and @typings  I get some weird errors when I try to serve my app in development mode. During Webpack build, I get the following errors, after which my build halts completely without further messages.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

When I look in the node_modules/typedoc folder, there isn't even a src folder!
Anyone have an idea of what the ***\* could be referencing typedoc source?

I've tried uninstall typedoc to no avail

Cheers

I turns out - that yes, typedoc does not support typescript2.0 yet.
So far so good - I removed typedoc, BUT  node_modules/.bin/typedoc was not removed in that process.

So: if you upgrade to TS2.0, make sure you remove tsdoc completely - ALSO in the node_modules/.bin folder.

Thanks guys, closing the case.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of awesome-typescript-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of awesome-typescript-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

in sources tab navigate to webpack://->.->src/app->app.component.ts

for example let's say that the url is `http://example.com` but the app is located in `http://example.com/wp-content/themes/angular2-webpack-starter`, is it possible to get it to work?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of awesome-typescript-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build kept failing**.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of karma.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?

  I assume that the travis ci builds will fail for this pr due to the fact that the official material2 components refer to the previous core rc and forms package in peer dependencies, i think there might be some issues introduced in rc4 that might have prevented an immediate update to the official material package. however, i have not noticed anything broken when updating this repo to use the latest rc, forms, router, and material2 alpha, so i thought i would open this pr in an attempt to prevent the material2 branch from falling too far behind master.

I'm the author of [Easy Webpack](https://github.com/easy-webpack/core), which is now used as the default configurator by the official Webpack starter kit for the Aurelia Framework. 
If you like the concept, it could be used to clean-up the Webpack config files used by the Webpack starter and possibly delegate parts of the config to a separate package that could be npm updated by your users. Feel free to consult [the docs](https://github.com/easy-webpack/core) and decide on your own if this is something you would be interested in using.

You should also update your examples to es6 for webpack 2.

If you like to maintain a branch of `easy-webpack` in this repo that might be a great compromise if you're interested we can see if devs prefer it etc

Actually, `easy-webpack` doesn't need to be used in combination with the ""magical"", external config packages that you cite above: all the configs can be inlined, it can be used as a more advanced `webpack-merge`, which as I see, you already use. 

Aurelia is recommending either RequireJS via the aurelia-cli or Webpack. JSPM is still an option, but it turned out to be just too messy at times to be used well in production.

This uses the [webpack/file-loader](https://github.com/webpack/file-loader) that copies the referenced assets (the jpg) to the output folder and leaves behind an URL for the browser to load.

I invite you to browse the (long) list of loaders: http://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-loaders.html
It's quite interesting to see what other loaders are available, like the `url-loader` that turns the file contents into `data:` urls.

Thanks @Tragetaschen... You know what? I tried the file-loader and it failed because I set my loader to `file-loader`, with the '-loader' suffix like all the other loaders. I didn't notice it's actually just `file`.

Have just confirmed that this solves the issue:.

Relevant part being..

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

If I change the css rule to;

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

the error is gone. So at least that shows that it uses my rules. I'm still learning a lot about webpack, so there might be something I am missing. But it is mostly based on angular2-webpack-starter. There are no other rules that collides. Ideas? The error is happening using the `vis` library.

Another observation is that I did not get any errors if I changed the loader to eg `'file123'`, so it for sure looks like the rule never hits. Do I need to learn webpack to handle `url()` in the css files?

759,2016-08-22 17:49:13,"Was looking into your issue, @xeor, and found that my fix, doesn't actually seem to fix anything. 

Near as I can tell, the issue went away when I switched to using root-relative background-image url(...)... with some mixup I attributed this to using the file-loader, but so far, it seems that even if I delete these loaders it works, as long as I'm using root-relative URLs.

This relates to css-loader's [root relative URLs feature](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader#root-relative-urls). 

The original issue, then, is still unsolved.

A quick workaround, I guess, is to just use root-relative urls, such as: `background-image url(/assets/img/myimg.jpeg)`

- **What is the current behavior?**
  helpers.isWebpackDevServer always returns false **(when used inside webpack config for anything other than src/index.html page).** 

To test, add the following line to webpack.common.js then run ""npm run server:dev"" and then ""npm run build:dev"" to watch the output.
console.log('DEBUG: helpers.isWebpackDevServer() = ' + helpers.isWebpackDevServer());

I presume it's intended for use by the HtmlWebpackPlugin and the src/index.html page, but if you want to use it elsewhere it breaks.  As it's quite a handy function, I am also using it for setting a few other conditional variables inside my webpack config.

After disabling my components one by one, I found out that this particular import causes the error:
`import {Subscription} from ""rxjs/Rx"";`
Commenting this import resolves the issue. I wanted to do something like `this.subscription.unsubscribe()` on a component's `ngOnDestroy` where `this.subscription`'s type is set to 'Subscription' imported from `rxjs/Rx`.

Strange that this causes Webpack to compile into ES6 though. Worth looking into?

Update: I'm using WebStorm 2016.1 and `rxjs/Rx` is the only file WebStorm recommends me to import `Subscription` from.

So main route will have 2 children. In that case, `<router-outlet>` should be there in parent only. If we put it in ""detail.component.ts"", structure will result in something like this :

I'm submitting a 
feature request

I am using node.js 5.12.0 and NPM 3.8.6

When i open my site in System browser its taking 3 to 4 seconds to load/open.
Same site if i open in mobile phones its taking 8 to 10 seconds.
I want to reduce the time taken by load the app second time. 2nd time files are serving from cache. 
If all files serving from cache also taking same time to load page. 
I have used webpack to remove chunk. so now js file only 200kb(zip).

Most of the time user open site in mobile phones with 2g/3g speed. so user feel that site is taking more time to open, so in mobile phones site should open in max 3-4 seconds.

  [x ] bug report

  [ ] question about the decisions made in the repository
- **What is the current behavior?**
  Running webpack or the webpack-dev-server will detect changed files a single time and successfully updates the browser. Subsequent changes trigger a webpack run, but no files are emitted and the browser reports ""No Changes"". Tried hot mode, normal mode, and every variation of config possible. I'm running Windows 10, and I confirmed that the bug is also present on another machine running Mac OS.

I pulled commit `afadc3b7e00fc0a06b4bf9f3ed85bbf41f620f09` and webpack behaves as expected and successfully picks up changes. I expect something has changed in the config between then and now. I will continue to investigate but wanted to start tracking this now.

Upgrading `awesome-typescript-loader` from `^0.17.0` to `2.0.0-rc.17` on master branch resolves this problem, but introduces multiple non-breaking errors, `Invalid module name in augmentation, module '../../Observable' cannot be found.`

Using 1.1.1 of `awesome-typescript-loader` also resolves my issue, and does not introduce the same errors as `2.0.0-rc.17`... so we'll be using 1.1.1 for the forseeable future.

@TheLarkInn Another interesting bug I found is that including a space after `templateUrl`, e.g. `templateUrl : './home.template.html'` instead of `templateUrl: './home.template.html'` causes the router to throw `Failed to load about.template.html` at runtime.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of karma.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

- **What is the current behavior?**
  requiring css in the styles Component attribute fails to concatenate base url to a relative url within that css file, instead concatenating './' and interrupting build process if the file isn't found.

Current project,  Commit a4019da :

home.component.ts 24:3, change to:
styles: [ require('./home.style.css') ],

home.style.css, add:
:host {
  background: url('assets/img/angular-logo.png');
}

run npm run start:hmr
- **What is the expected behavior?**
- base url should be concatenated to the relative url.
- build process should not be interrupted if the url isn't found
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
  This behavior is not expected to break when all past versions of this repo supported it, and Angular's docs encourage it in the Webpack section.

Switching back to raw-loader to handle css files solves this issue.

  A feature
- **What is the current behavior?**
  There's no current support for [Static Template Compilation](http://teropa.info/blog/2016/05/19/things-that-excite-me-about-angular-2.html#static-template-compilation) nor [Web Workers](http://teropa.info/blog/2016/05/19/things-that-excite-me-about-angular-2.html#web-worker-support) nor [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)
- **What is the expected behavior?**
  Have support for those 3 technologies in the app.
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
  - Static template compilation: Speed up the render process and performance as well as lowering the size of the bundles.
  - Web Workers: Offloading resource intensive operations to a new thread thus making better use of multicore cpus (today even mobile have multicore).
  - Service workers: Mainly to support offline applications using libs like [sw-precache](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache) or [sw-toolbox](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-toolbox), but also to support background sync and push notifications.  
- **Other information**

",luchillo17,
728,2016-06-24 17:55:19,"I've been digging in how to integrate webworkers with offline mode in webpack and so far i have seen 2 plugins that takes care of that:
- [Offline plugin](https://github.com/NekR/offline-plugin)
- [sw-precache-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/goldhand/sw-precache-webpack-plugin)

So far it seems the Offline plugin is better since it states that it fallbacks to AppCache if service worker isn't supported in the browser, this plugin will only cache the webpack generated files, basically the source code, meanwhile the sw-precache-webpack-plugin has a ton more configuration options about caching other requests like images, videos and api data, basically any regex pattern for request the user wants to define, further testing and analysis required.
",luchillo17,
728,2016-06-24 20:37:07,"After analysing the current support i take for granted that the best tool is Offline plugin since it allows to use a fallback to AppCache, the browsers related are Safari (partial support) and Edge (currently only available from development builds).

Resource (support table):  [isserviceworkerready](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready)
",luchillo17,
728,2016-06-24 22:29:15,"After a bit more testing i still think the `Offline plugin` is the way to go, it works excelent to generate both the service worker for offline support and the cache manifest as fallback, as well as caching the app.

Meanwhile the `sw-precache-webpack-plugin` doesn't offer any fallback without support for service worker, it caches fine when in supported browsers, however docs are a bit outdated comparing to the code, and there's some weird behaviour where in production the service worker just generates 1 cache for each file instead of putting all files in the same cache, which i think is due to the `UglifyJsPlugin` plugin, idk if it's expected behaviour or a bug.

Lastly the `sw-precache-webpack-plugin` will not work with dev server as the generated service worker doesn't get served by the `webpack-dev-server`.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of karma.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

  [x] bug report
  [ ] feature request
  [ ] question about the decisions made in the repository
- **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**
  Report a possible bug.
- **What is the current behavior?**
  Running tests with karma auto-watch active (npm run watch:test) does not always trigger the correct results, as it seems something is not fetching the correct last version of the code.
- **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** 

Steps:
- clone the project
- npm install
- npm run watch:test
- \- the test are sucessfull
- change src/app.component.ts line 58 `url = 'https://twitter.com/AngularClass';` to `url = 'https://twitter.com/AngularClassXXXX'`
- the tests are **not sucessfull, which is correct**
- undo the change made on src/app.component.ts line 58
- the tests are **not sucessfull, which is incorrect**

So the **first change in code** after karma starts is always triggered, then the strange behaviour happens (cant find a pattern)
- subsequent changes are not trigger
- sometimes after a change in code, to trigger the correct behaviour I need to change a second file 

Seems something about karma-webpack-webpack-middleware is caching the old code or not syncing correctly.
- **What is the expected behavior?**
  Every last change in code reflected in the environment tests that are running with karma watch
- **Please tell us about your environment:**
- I used the last version of the repo (as today) 
- Browser: [ PhantomJS 2..0.1 | Chrome 51.0.2704.63 ]

723,2016-06-22 18:14:59,"Hi,

If we need to include [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), instructions given in the [wiki](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-include-jQuery) work fine, but **there are some special cases** we need to be aware of.

Let me explain with a simple use case : **adding [Foundation-sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites.html) in the project.**

Foundation-sites has a dependency to jQuery, so when installed it will install jQuery in our `node_modules` folder. But in the Foundation-site module, there's also a `vendor`folder that provide JQuery too (**and not necessary the same** than the one listed in the `package.json`'s dependencies of the Foundation-site module).

So, if we follow only your instructions, for this use case, **these two versions of jQuery will be imported** in the generated `vendor.js` bundle.

We can handle these kind of thing with a **[null-loader](https://github.com/webpack/null-loader) webpack loader** for things we want to be sure they'll not be imported.

Something like that  :

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Obviously, only the `webpack.ProvidePlugin` method is concerned. Maybe add some other methods (like with [script-loader](https://github.com/webpack/script-loader) for instance) could also be useful, don't you think?

Don't you think these informations could be useful for others? If so, maybe you should add them in the [Wiki](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki)?

",gdi2290,2016-06-24 19:50:56
723,2016-06-23 15:49:03,"I realized that I don't identified the reason well. 

If there is no jquery module as ""root module"" (in the root of the main node_modules folder), and you install foundation-sites, this jquery module will be installed as ""root module"". And your solution works well. 

But if another module depends on jQuery, and if it is not the same than the previous one,  when installed, the ""previous one"" will be copied in the foundation-sites's node_modules  directory, and the ""new one"" as ""root module"".

In this case, we need the solution I provided. 

Let me do other tests, clean everything and I'll update the wiki ;)

  A bunch of our vendors stay the same, and they can contribute to longer build times.

  Use premade Webpack DLL bundles for vendors and polyfill. This essentially would remove all the parse time from the build process. 
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?** Since our vendor files don't typically change, and since mine, @preboot, and your webpack starters including my fork of the CLI all use the same vendors, we could have a vendor and polyfill Dll bundle that maybe we can keep in @angularclass/webpack-toolkit and keep everyone in sync with.

Bug. 
- **What is the current behavior?**

I'm using Karma with the `singleRun` option set to `false` because I write the tests then reload the tab in Chrome (or I can set `autowatch` to `true`). So if I had the file with the below code (or any .ts file, spec or not):

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Then if I run Karma and edited the file (say I add more tests). The console changes (it seems that Karma picks up the file change) but when reloading the test tab the changes are not there! So if I add 100 tests to the above. Karma will only run that one test unless I close Karma and open it again.
- **What is the expected behavior?**

Before #https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/commit/8add16dd55279b358e1a54af3541e1698354d323#diff-e5e546dd2eb0351f813d63d1b39dbc48 things weren't like this. I open Karma, edit my code, give it a few milliseconds to reload the files and then refresh the web page to see the test results.

I solved this by redoing the changes made in that commit, so that `ts.config` will look similar to this:

  [x ] question about the decisions made in the repository
- **What is the current behavior?**
  The package.json file lists project dependencies. 
  I noticed that a lot of the ""project"" packages, for example @angular/\*  are  listed in the dependencies section.

I assume that when a project is built, all dependencies are put into the bundle files.
Therefore I would assume that all the files in the ""dependencies"" section really should be in the ""devDependencies"" section.

Let's for example say that you want to add a node backend (which is reasonable to think). 
You would install packages for the backend, and when you deploy the application you would copy your backend source to the destination server, and then run ""npm install --production""

This would effectively install all the @angular/\* packages in the production environment. A behaviour you don't want. Npm install --production installs all packages listed in the ""dependencies"" section.

So my question is:
Is there something I've completely missed - or should we not move all packages into the ""devDependencies"" section?

If not, how would you distinct packages to be installed in a production environment, when adding a node backend?

Cheers, guys, really appreciate this project, it has helped me tremendously in setting up the exact environment I need for my projects.
",spock123,2016-06-30 09:10:10
714,2016-06-21 16:50:31,"Hi, i think is more about concept than about actual use, off course you can put `@angular` dependencies in dev since most users just install in production by uploading the bundled files and installing the server deps.

The concept i talk is that devDeps are the deps you need during development (mostly webpack, browserify, gulp...) and in normal deps goes the ones your app really use (like @angular/core) so it's about stating in the package that deps are the ones your app requires and devDeps are the ones you use to bundle, compile or deploy your app.
",luchillo17,2016-06-30 09:10:10
714,2016-06-30 09:10:07,"I understand this - however once you try to setup a node backend in the same project, you'll be in trouble.

This is mostly and information to newbies: if you use this excellent repo as a starter for your project, and you also need a backend as part of the project, do yourself a favor and move all dependencies to the ""devDependencies"" section.

Otherwise you end up installing a lot of modules in your production environment that you won't need.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of file-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

It should not throw an error. Either the webpack-shell-plugin be changed to original or just added as dependency.

  - Browser: [Firefox 39.0]
- **Other information** 

We've updated our project to the angular2-webpack-starter with Angular RC1.
What I've found out by trial and error:

In Firefox
1. NgZone.onStable and NgZone.onUnstable do not occur after the XHR/fetch completes. 
2. I've managed to work around this issue by excluding core-js/es6/promise. So, I suggest that this polyfill breaks angular.

You can see my fix here: https://github.com/borisvasilenko/angular2-webpack-starter/commit/da2ac7966279e120dd00f6b22837960225b30329

To reproduce it easly create a very basic project using webpack (you can clone my MEAN stack project) and into vendor.ts try to write ""import 'core-js/es6';"" or all the files individually, including promise.

If you need data from server best approach to use Http service from '@angular/http'. Because it has required change detection code.

But if you really need to use async code that located outside of angular app, you need to wrap it with [NgZone.run(yourCode)](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/NgZone-class.html#!#run-anchor) or finalize it with [ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/ChangeDetectorRef-class.html#!#detectChanges-anchor)

but, 
http://blog.thoughtram.io/angular/2016/02/22/angular-2-change-detection-explained.html
""Angular [2] allows us to use native APIs directly."" 
So I believe, that you're not right, and that the NgZone.run or detectChanges are unnecessary.

I also believe, that your work-around is worse than removing the 'core-js/es6' import, because it pollutes the project code with unnecessary calls like NgZone.run or detectChanges. 

And yes, I know about @angular/http, but issue is not about @angular/http. I still need to use raw fetch API at some places. And I need to use it directly, without NgZone.run or other work-arounds.

  [X] question about the decisions made in the repository

Would like to use typescript ""official"" types on npm as seen in the recent blog https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2016/06/15/the-future-of-declaration-files/ 

I've gotten it working (removed all typings) with:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

except i had to set my tsconfg target to es6 to get rid of errors like `Cannot find name 'Promise'` coming from inside @angular libraries. 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Was wondering if anyone else here has tried these out and had success with es5 and if this repository planned on changing over.

Edit: this repo would probably need @types/hammerjs too. I don't happen to use it.

Edit 2: I've added the following and no longer get errors.
packages

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

tsconfig (note the types array)

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I think the question still stands on if this repo will switch. I think using only npm is nice.

I saw that you added the routes using `provideRouter`...

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I am wondering though how to use this for sub routes or whether it is currently possible at all as with router-deprecated the application RouteConfig could be applied via decorator to the main component and using `/...` for one route marks this route as parent for sub routes being applied to another component adding its own RouteConfig

Do you see any way to do this? Or maybe this is not intended (yet) with the new router? Can you give me some advice?

Cheers

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of typings.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

You really should spend an hour looking at the document - it might look ""long"", but that is because it describes both how forms work now - and how they work in the new module. It's much simpler and easy. 

Right now it's opt-in. From next RC you will have to choose and at some point it will become the default forms module.

Again, imho, it's much better than what we've  had so far.

696,2016-06-16 08:39:22,"Maybe you are looking for [ng2-bootstrap](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-bootstrap#with-webpack-angularclassangular2-webpack-starter)

Generally to load jQuery in your project do `npm install jquery --save` and `typings install jquery`
and then add this line in _vendor.ts_

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

That's it, all external libraries works the same way, `import 'library-name';` 

in some cases when the library doesn't include index.js in their root directory, then you will need to locate it the way you are doing like `import ""library-name/dist/library-name""`.
",MurhafSousli,2016-06-22 16:09:49
696,2016-06-16 08:51:19,"@MurhafSousli Thanks for the response. 

I have looked at ng-bootstrap, and it seems great. However, I have a restriction which requires me to use standard bootstrap 3. 

As for jQuery, I have added it into the project using `typings` and also changed my import to the one you have suggested. But, I don't really need jQuery by itself, I just need to so that I can get Bootstrap 3 running. Which, unfortunately, I haven't been managed to load up.
",shahzad-0,2016-06-22 16:09:49
696,2016-06-16 10:03:35,"I just tested it now.
**Step 1:** Install both _jquery_ and _bootstrap_

`npm install jquery bootstrap --save`

**Step 2:** Import them in _vendor.ts_:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

**Step 3:** Go to _wepback.common.js_ in config directory and add this inside plugin section:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This will let _bootstrap_ to find _jquery_

**Step 4:** Import bootstrap css, you can do that by importing it in the head of your index.html or from your app.css, I used the second way.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The reason I didn't import it from _node_modules_ folder that It won't load the fonts, however you can fix this by overriding the fonts imports in _app.css_

After you do these steps you will probably get this error:

`Uncaught Error: Bootstrap's JavaScript requires jQuery version 1.9.1 or higher, but lower than version 3`
This is because the current jquery version installed is 3.0.0, so go back and install a previous version of jquery

",gearlles,2016-06-22 16:09:49
696,2016-06-22 13:44:42,"@gearlles You are getting the 404 because `node_modules` doesn't get added to your `dist` folder. If you want to use the `bootstrap.css` file, then you can put it under `src/assets/css/` and in your css file you should be able to import it using `@import url('/assets/css/bootstrap.css')`.
",shahzad-0,2016-06-22 16:09:49
696,2016-06-22 14:00:51,"@shahzad-0 Thanks. But I think it's not a good idea, it's harder to maintain. Suppose I want to upgrade bootstrap version in the future, not everyone in the project would know that apart from `packages.json`,   `/assets/css/bootstrap.css` should be modified.

Note that this problem exists in the @MurhafSousli solution. Both `packages.json` and `app.css` should be modified.

696,2016-06-22 14:05:40,"@gearlles Yes, I agree. That's what I was trying to find out when I created the issue. But since importing the css into `vendors.js` didn't work, I'm not sure what else can be done.

Please post a solution here when you find one.

## 1. Install dependencies

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

**Note**: I'm not sure if all dependencies are indeed necessary. I used dependencies from #215 and added others to get it working for Bootstrap 3.

## 2. Configure Webpack

Edit `webpack.common.js` to add new loaders and plugin.

### To add loaders, edit `loaders:[]`

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

### To add the jQuery plugin, edit `plugins: []`

696,2016-06-22 16:09:49,"@gearlles I have a limitation of using `less`, so I don't think I can use the `bootstrap-loader`. But I #215 will probably resolve this issue for most people, who are able to use sass. And anyone who can't use the `bootstrap-loader`, the solution provided by @MurhafSousli should be enough (although your point of having to update the `package.json` and `app.css` files for updating bootstrap should be kept in mind).

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of typings.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build kept failing**.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

- **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**

This [commit](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/commit/8bbf0447c193172b48e270ab242efaf71e75d1de) brake the tests.
- **What is the current behavior?**
  If you run `npm test` a lot of logs are reported (see on the bottom), the problem is related to the `awesome-typescript-loader` update from `""~0.17.0""` to `""^1.0.0""`, going back to `""~0.17.0""` seems to correct the problem.
- **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** 

Just run `npm test`.
- **What is the expected behavior?**

The tests must run normally.
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

Be able to run tests.
- **Please tell us about your environment:**
- Angular version: 2.0.0-rc.1
- Browser: not relevant

  When I import momentjs in clean project all sourcemaps became broken

how to reproduce:
1) install project from repo
2) install momentjs: `npm install moment`
3) in app.component.ts: 
add import
`import * as moment from 'moment/moment';` 
in ngOnInit method add momentjs usage:
`var date = moment(new Date()).format();`
4) run 'npm start'
5) try to open 'home.component.ts' in chrome devtools:
<img alt=""screenshot"" src=""http://i66.tinypic.com/jrqy3o.png""/>

Using `git bisect` today, I found out that the introduction of `momentjs` into our builds broke source maps on Chrome Version 51.0.2704.103 (64-bit).

Webpack config has `devtool: 'cheap-module-source-map'`.

A fix for us was to include either of the following as a Webpack plugin:
- `new webpack.ContextReplacementPlugin(/moment[\/\\]locale$/, /en-us/)`
- `new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/^\.\/locale/, /moment$/)` 

Note that the first solution works but is broken, since there's no `en-us` files in `moment/locale` for v2.13.0 - I just got it via copy-pasta from another project. The second solution should be preferred.

Ping @lanceharper @ccastarivale; this happened in https://github.com/trueprint/arivale-coach-client/commit/37b7a12b54e4068613b5d487c6cb12bda7a77823.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ts-node.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of awesome-typescript-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

I fail to use a react component in the current angular2-webpack-starter who uses angular2.0.0-rc.1
I followed some guidelines mainly
https://github.com/LookLikeAPro/Angular-2-React-Example and https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom

My current error is a fail at compile:

**What I have done so far:**

installed packages and typings
<pre><code>npm install react react-dom --save

modified config/webpack.common.js
<pre><code>resolve: {

    extensions: ['', '.ts', '.js', '.tsx'],
...
}
loaders: [

      {

        loader: 'awesome-typescript-loader',
        exclude: [/.(spec|e2e).tsx?$/]
      },
...
]
</pre></code>

used and modified the content of npm package angular2-react and inserted the folder inside my component folder for prototyping purpose, here's the content of my schema-form folder:
- angular2-react
- \- component.ts
- \- react.ts
- \- react-dom.ts
- react-wrapper.tsx

I am thinking this has to do with awesome-typescript-loader that can't handle tsx file type, but I have no idea what to change at this point. Any ideas or tips would be appreciated.

Thank you

- **What is the current behavior?**

Currently when karma runs jasmine and a test fails, the stack trace will show the line number in the spec-bundle file instead of the original source.  The source maps exist that it should be possible to trace back.
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

I think that the karma framework package: karma-source-map-support (https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma-source-map-support) should help with this but I can't get it up and running.

Has anyone else had any luck?

I'm very interested in this topic. Any progress ?
I'm currently trying to write my own components and publish to NPM. As long as my components only include typescript code and HTML templates it's working fine. 
But when I need my components to include a css (or scss) file by means of ""styleUrls"" attribute in @component decorator then it's not working. Same thing if I have, in my component, some png which I want to use either in HTML or css.
I checked that everything is correctly published in my component but starter doesn't seem to care about it.

Anyone tried this (and succeeded ;-)) ? any help, pointer to some similar issue would be appreciated ! I can provide the component I wrote for testing purpose and also my fork of the starter (everything is on github).

Thanks

I want to integrate electron to this repo but with all the features like hmr and live reload, then if is possible debug the app with visual studio code as I'm already doing with this repo.
Do you know how to approach this?

If your interested in helping out I can invite you to it. Mainly I am mixing https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter with https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular2-seed-advanced.

here is my plans for it and current state:

# TODO

## Before internal use
- [ ] Fix unit tests
- [x] Fix E2E tests
- [x] Electron Builder
- [ ] Nativescript
- [ ] Fix async load components

## Before Open Sourcing
- [x] Change references to @JonnyBGod
- [x] Docs (typedoc)
- [x] Generate all icons and fix references in index.html
- [ ] Redo readme.md
  - [ ] Mention need for typescript@next
- [ ] CI release all platforms for demo app
- [x] Make it as easy as possible to extend

## Improvements
- [ ] Generate ApiService from swagger endpoint
- [ ] Generate ngrx/store reducer from swagger endpoint

## Extras (branches?)
- [ ] Windows Universal App
- [ ] Ionic
- [ ] React Native

I think you can only access Node.js modules from the main scripts of Electron, but not in the different windows opened. Does the app itself work with the fs modules, aside from the tests?

This requires modification to the `index.html` so every `href` and `src` links are properly set.

The current PR isn't ideal since it adds noise to the index.html file.

**Potential solution - using `<base>`:**
I'm not `<base>` expert but I think it might be done with only changing the `<base>`, this should effect all paths automatically. I have tried to play with it but couldn't get consistent result and I guess it's because I was missing a slash or something.

The question is, does `<base>` works the same in all browsers? In chrome I got it to work on the javascript files but the static `<link>` tags did not get the base prefix.

Also, does the location of the `<base>` tag matters? I mean, if it's after a `<link>` tag it won't operate on it?

",valorkin,2016-06-13 13:52:44
645,2016-06-08 00:52:40,"@valorkin The implementation does use the `gh-pages` package but it wont work out of the box, it need some help getting it to actually work.

The main reason is that in github the base url is always **username**.github.io/**repo-name**. In most cases the application will not have a **repo-name** prefix, it's usually the root of the domain.

So, we have 3 different setups:  
-  Local dev server
-  Deployment in production
-  Deployment in github.

This is why we need an additional config since it a different setup.

We also need to think about the purpose of `angular2-webpack-starter`, it's a set tools aimed to making the developers life easier, not having to manually manage work flows.
Having to run `gh-pages -d dist` manually requires some previous steps, you have to run the build and if you forgot you probably just posted an older version to github, this is a common mistake that happened to me more then once :)
It get's even worse if you forgot to edit your **index.html** to support the github pages base url prefix, again happened to me more then once.
This is actually why I created this flow, then realized it can be integrated into this project.

Another thing is that you can deploy 2 (or more, custom) compilation artefacts to github, minified production build or a development build.

Also, this PR tries to keep it simple so you don't have a lot of configuration options to control the `gh-pages` package, this can be done in a later phase. I prefer a simple PR first so we can understand it.

So using the `gh-pages -d dist` approach you need to do some manual work, which is the same for every release: build and edit `index.html`, this is a prefect scenario for automation.

If you investigate the config file you will see it's basically a simple webpack plugin, I think we should first adopt the PR and then opt for a plugin after we get around most use cases and options to support.

Add's a lot of noise that I really don't like, and it's ""sort of"" an API change, this is why I asked @gdi2290 to ask for community help.

BTW, if a user has a public path different then `/` this is something that he needs to do anyway, hardcoding the public path is a recipe for future errors since it can't be refactored automatically.

The solution here is probably defining a static asset array with objects for every  static asset and building them when we compile index.html, something like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This allows supporting every attribute out there.
It also doesn't break anything, if someone doesn't want github deployment support he can just hardcode his assets.

All in all, I think it's better to define static assets outside of `index.html` and keep it as clean as possible.

Since a static asset file has volume I don't think it should be within the configurations themselves.

We can put it in a file, in the config directory... something like
`assets.common.json` or `assets.dev.json` etc... 

In the configs we can opt in for them if the file exists and create the html, this result's in a non breaking API modification.

Another option is to let the user set the json asset file (path) in the config's.

I like the first option better, it's convention over configuration which is less confusion.

  [ ] feature request
  [ ] question about the decisions made in the repository
- **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**
  I want to report a problem with the current integration of the PostCSS / SASS Loader
- **What is the current behavior?**
  The Post CSS matching works great in Development mode, but not when the app is build for production.
  Currently the generated css misses the -webkit prefixes (at least for display: flex) when the app is build with the `npm run build:prod` command.   
- **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via

Here is a fork of the current material2 branch with added PostCss / Sass support to replicate the problem:

`git clone -b postcss --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/Tre665/angular2-webpack-starter.git`

These are the steps to add PostCss/Sass to the project:
1. clone the current version of the material2 branch 
   `git clone -b material2 --depth 1  --single-branch https://github.com/angularclass/angular2-webpack-starter.git` 
2. Follow the instructions to add SCSS support as described here: 
   [https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-include-SCSS-in-components](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-include-SCSS-in-components)
3. Follow the instructions to add PostCSS / SCSS support as described here:
   [https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-include-PostCSS](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-include-PostCSS)

The File config/webpack.common.js looks afterwards like this (added only the important parts, all other already existing config is unchanged)

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
1. Add some css that needs to be processed for older browsers.
   (e.g I changed the app.css to app.scss, changed the reference in app.component.ts and added the css property  `display: flex;` to the html, body { } block at the top.
- **What is the expected behavior?**
  The auto prefixing via post css should also work for the production build. 
  The best case would be that the output of the production build is always the same as the dev build (except for the explicit changes that are made in the webpack.dev and webpack.prod files) 
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
  Being able to deploy the production build :-) 
- **Please tell us about your environment:**
- Mac OSX 10.10
- Angular version: 2.0.0-RC1
- Node v4.4.4
- NPM 3.9.0

  Hi there,
  first things first: this project is amazing and I had a really good time to develop on top of it. Also I want to note that this is my first reported issue on Github. So please bear with me if I made some mistakes in the process.

I have successfully worked with the posted configuration for a while. Last week I decided to clone the newest version and migrate my project to it.

At first I had also problems with the dev build of my project (the same problems as reported now for the production build. That problem was easily fixed with an update of the postCss Configuration. It used to be 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

and I changed it to 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

With this change the `-webkit`prefixes was back in the generated css. However, recently i noted that this 'fix' will not work for the production build. 

I tried my best to get it also back to running here but unfortunately without success so far.

Here is what i tried:
- added the config explicitly also to the webpack.prod.js file
- compared the (for me) relevant npm packages that might have changes in it and downgraded the packages to the former working versions (including: node-sass, postcss-cssnext, postcss-loader)
- tried various configs for the browser matching pattern to get the `-webkit` prefix back
- removed the browser matching pattern completely
- removed the browser matching pattern completely and added a browserlist file with the config file as documented postcss documentation here [https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#no-prefixes-in-production](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer#no-prefixes-in-production)  

Unfortunately nothing above has fixed the issue.
I can only get 2 different states: With the above config it only adds the `-ms`prefixes but not the `-webkit` prefixes. And if i completely remove the browser matching pattern the, it adds the old `webkit` prefixes  
with `display: -webkit-box.

No matter what browser matching pattern i use, the resulted css is always the same. I also validated the expected results with this [http://autoprefixer.github.io](url) online tool and the filter 'last 3 versions' should work.

As a side node:
On the old project that i cloned initially the autoprefix plugin works also with the production build. 

I would really appreciate any help or comments on this issue.

[https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer/issues/660](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer/issues/660)

and also here in the webpack repo:
[https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2543](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2543)

The proposed solution/workaround works also for me. I changed the config from the webpack.common.config to include the `?minimize&-autoprefixer` option to disable the additional minifiyng of the CSS loader.

Here is the change:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This disables the minification step of the CSS Loader. Which had falsely removed the -webkit prefixes. 

Once again, thank you very much for your help! 

Should we update the [Post CSS Wiki](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-include-PostCSS) with that fix? What do you think?

  Bug fix
- **What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)
  When creating a build using `build:dev` the index.html request a javascript resource **webpack-dev-server.js**.
  **webpack-dev-server.js** is used by `webpack-dev-server` which also returns it (the resource).
  Since a build is intended to run in a different web server it will always 404.
- **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**
  Do not include 'webpack-dev-server.js`script request in builds, only include it when running udner`webpack-dev-server`
- **Other information**:
  The current implementation uses **ENV** to determine if were in development mode, if so include `webpack-dev-server.js`. A build can also be a development mode. To get the real answer a helper function checks for the file used to run the process, if its `webpack-dev-server` then we include the resource.

642,2016-06-01 07:57:40,"I finally found the setup that works with Bootstrap (I had problems with tests when using Bootstrap 4 alpha). So now I use Bootstrap 3 and _almost_ everything works - the app and the tests.

The only issue I have now with glyphicons and bootstrap fonts. For example, when I use

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

the icon is not loaded and here's what I get in the console:

Obviously, nothing like 'node_modules/...' exists so how do I set it up with webpack?

Currently, I use .less and these loaders:

641,2016-05-31 16:02:14,"Adding a css preprocesser is incredibly easy. 

Simply install the corresponding css loader you want, for instance for less you can use https://github.com/webpack/less-loader.

`npm install less-loader -S`

In `./config/webpack.common.js` change the loaders entry from 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

to 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

then inside your component

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The procedure here is the same for sass, or styles. You could also use pre-css/autoprefixer, as I am here: https://github.com/paynoattn/paynoattn-angular2/blob/master/config/webpack.common.js

2016-05-26T22:08:59.809830+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Process running mem=751M(146.7%)
2016-05-26T22:08:59.810022+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Error R14 (Memory quota exceeded)
2016-05-26T22:09:21.397875+00:00 heroku[web.1]: Error R10 (Boot timeout) -> Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 60 seconds of launch
- **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
  https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).
- **What is the expected behavior?**
  It would be nice to have a quick guide about deploying this to a server since it is meant to be a starter pack and I would guess that plenty of people here new to working with this stack. 
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
  Better understanding of how to deploy the framework to a remote environment. 
- **Please tell us about your environment:**
- Angular version: 2.0.0-beta.11
- Browser: [all | Chrome  50.0.2661.102 m
  node version 4.4.1
  npm 3.8.0

",ebeal,
630,2016-05-31 18:35:44,"That sounds about right. Im not sure what all I can discard from the
project to make it light enough for my deployment to Heroku. Right now, the
only way I could get the project to start building on heroku, was to
include all dev dependencies at dependencies. If I dont, I get other
errors. When I dump all dev's into regular dependencies, I error memory
errors.

Any suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated. Im just building a
small contact form that is hooked up to a MongoDB. Should be pretty
lightweight when I clean up the excess functionality from the framework
(not that Im sure where Ill start on that either).

Thanks

EDIT: after many days of working on this, our fix was to move the build into the 'postinstall': https://github.com/mrowles/legends-of-pingpong/blob/master/package.json

Ill have to check out your fix though. It would be nice to auto deploy to heroku on commits instead of my process.

629,2016-05-26 23:02:50,"Hi,

With router-deprecated, here is what I was doing for lazy load components : 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

and in Webpack ;

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I was using [es6-promise-loader](https://github.com/gdi2290/es6-promise-loader) , that can expose this `name`property for webpack

So, everything worked well, I got my lazyloaded comp working, and in a separate named chunk.

But, as you can see, I was using the deprecated router.

Trying to update to new RC1 router, I can't make it working anymore.

I obviously apply the changes (`@Routes` instead of `RouteConfig`, no more route `name`, etc.) but I can't figure out how I can handle the ""missing loader issue"" (there's no more `loader`property in the new router, no?). 

I tried  this : 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

but got this error : 

`Error: Uncaught (in promise): No Directive annotation found on component`

and also tried this : 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

and now got this error: 

`Uncaught (in promise): No Directive annotation found on [object Object]`

So, can anybody help me to achieve this ? Thanks.

622,2016-05-31 07:37:16,"@kushwahashiv yeah, I had the same problem yesterday when I tried to install that on Heroku. The above step I mentioned solved only a part of it but finally I managed to solve it by:
1- Remove the --bail flag => it doesn't solve anything but the error stack was much more meaningful when it's gone.
2- In my Heroku build, I forgot to install the typings on Heroku. Check whether you have not forgotten to do that either.

Regarding Typings, I had also another problem, in the newest version (typings > 1), it looks now different. Finally my current (successful) typings file looks like that

Thanks for reply. I was having typings already installed on my machine.
here are my observations:
1) `--bail` removal is basically allowing build to proceed to show actual errors which I fixed.
2) Although I have following version of node - v6.2.0 and npm- v3.8.9 this should not be an issue
3) you can remove dev and ambient dependencies sections from typings.ts  as these has been replaced with `""globalDependencies""`

Notice that I had to change to a different folder first, otherwise Windows does not change the case of the drive letter since it doesn't consider the directory to have changed.

The core issue is that __dirname is returning a value with an upper case drive letter but cwd() will return a lower case drive letter (unless you use the work around above). This needs to be fixed in nodejs.  Be sure and follow issue at the last link so the nodejs team will know.

IMHO the idea of 'build on your dev machine and only deploy the built version' is not good practice. The only way to deploy then is either use ftp/scp or something similar, or commit your `dist/` directory. I don't like either of those options.

In a node production environment everything could be automated by moving these dependencies, using git to checkout your latest code in production, and running your build and either `npm run server:prod` or adding a `server.js` and creating a simple express app that serves your `dist` folder.
",paynoattn,2017-01-24 20:27:49
614,2016-05-24 12:55:54,"On my side the deployment is still automated, I call the deployment, it builds everything and cause the upload via SSH of the dist/ resulted (and remotely call npm install). I think deployment is much lighter that way (which makes sense for production) as you move only a bunch of files instead of your whole source code (that is not going to be used anyway after the build) also, you cut global dependencies like Typescript.
You might as well not want your original source code to be uploaded to a production server.
Another argument would be that building your source code on the target server will make it busy for a much higher time, and will totally break things if the build fail (meanwhile if your local build fail, nothing gets uploaded).

614,2016-05-24 19:24:37,"I see your point about build failure but you're making a lot of assumptions about your ng2 app and your production environment. There are a number of use cases where you would want or need to build in production, such as if you are trying to integrate your ng2 app with a node app, or that the security team for your company has disabled ssh traffic in the network, or any other number of reasons.

We could argue all day which use case is more important/popular but since my changes don't effect your ability to deploy your way at all and gives others such as me the ability to build in production it seems kind of an irrelevant argument to have for me.

- externalize all the build to a separate project (i.e., make it reusable but still extensible)
- externalize all build scripts to a CLI

But might want to ask yourself why your app needs to load all vendors during app bootstrap. You should serve the vendor bundles that you need ""on demand"" as your app needs them. Just require() the stuff you need inside the components you need and webpack and angular2 take care of the rest.

  [X ] feature request
- **What is the current behavior?**

Currently Webpack HMR appends inlined style tags to the head in the form of <style></style> tags. This makes it difficult to view which component each css class belongs to, because the CSS inspector pane normally says ""buttons.scss"" when using <link href=""button.css""> with sourcemaps.

Now it just says `<style>...</style>` in the right hand pane.

![no_inline_styles_please](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13709948/15326836/4a919ee6-1c04-11e6-816f-d30e56658711.png)

When dealing with many css classes, its very difficult to know which component to go into to begin styling without it telling me which component's class is active.
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

Here is what most CSS developers are used to and expect: 

![external_styles](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13709948/15326901/80f21ace-1c04-11e6-9dd0-d0e5eff659fb.png)

It says frameworks-10c1164.css is the source of the class, therefore I know to go to that file/component to make changes. 

It would be ideal if webpack HMR preserved this standard CSS workflow while still enabling HMR. A simple solution is to simply appent external styles to the head such as <link href=""buttons.scss""> and then swap out that <link> tag when HMR sends an update. 

Is it feasible?

596,2016-05-16 22:45:51,"HMR does work to add new code to the page live, but it just piles new tags with all their css and JS to the head.

So I end up with the old styles and scripts, PLUS the new styles and scripts, and each time I save I get more and more appended to the head.

Isn't HMR supposed to ""dispose"" of the old styles and scripts before appending the new ones? What am I missing to make HMR properly dispose of old and tags?

586,2016-05-17 12:30:33,"I see the value of using the cli with Systemjs good for prototyping. In one or two lines, you already have a base Angular2 application. Yet, System.js is way more limited compared to Webpack and I would be careful to use System.js over Webpack for any big application.

On another hand, for knowing Webpack since now a few months, it's ""sometimes"" a pain to configure correctly, but this project helps a lot to get started with and I would highly recommend it for any medium/large project.

Also regarding the new router: I've started an Angular2 project few weeks ago based on this repo and then customized Webpack and all the rest to my needs. No problem getting the new router to work, you just need to follow the guide https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html or anything similar. It's very little about Webpack actually, much more about Angular2 itself.
",Krisa,
586,2016-05-17 12:37:37,"I personally think also that webpack for production apps is the way to go. there is definitely value in the CLI but I thik there is a lot to gain with webpack like was already mentioned here, good things land on webpack from all the communities not just Angular and that is a a benefit just on its own.

That being said I am sure that webpack will eventually be supported in the cli project as well. While that does not happen I would stick with an approach like this project.

586,2016-05-17 12:48:45,"@gdi2290 Why don't you start an angular-cli addon using webpack now. I am sure lot of people will help to make webpack part of ng cli.
",tapas4java,
586,2016-06-01 21:15:32,"I have to agree with @joaogarin. The webpack approach seems to be more tailored towards building an production ready environment. For me webpack really offers everything i need for nearly every use case regarding web application development. Also don't forget that webpack 2 offers native support for loading es6 modules and even provides ""tree-shaking"" for creating even smaller builds. I doesn't know anything that systemjs can do, that webpack 2 doesn't.

But regarding Angular-CLI i have to say, that i like this approach for scaffolding web applications. Ember JS showed us how this needs to be done. So in my opinion a combination of angular cli and webpack would be the ultimate solution.

  [X] question about the decisions made in the repository

Are there any plans to incorporate Angular Universal? For me (and I assume for many others), this is a coveted feature. Perhaps there's a way to replace the http-server with [this](https://universal.angular.io/quickstart/) express server setup?

If there is no intent to include Universal, then maybe someone (more knowledgable than myself) could write a wiki on it? I'll be making an attempt in the next few weeks. If I happen to figure it out by then, I'll be happy to write one.
",louisscruz,2017-01-25 06:34:50
576,2016-05-17 19:01:33,"well, I got it working. 

Using the universal-starter as an offset, I created a seperate webpack config for the server build. Important notes:

1) Dont use chunks (vendor/polyfills). Build everything as one entry.
2) In tsconfig.json, remove the ""noEmitHelpers"" entry, or you will get errors like

__declare is undefined.

3) merge the dependencies from universal-starter (package.json and typings.json)
4) Add seperate scripts to the package.json (copy the dev or test targets).

To run, you'd then have two terminals open, one doing ""watch"" to rebuild, and one running nodemon to run/restart the server 

I dont have the expertise to make it one single webpack config.

that's the issue. So, I don""t understand if you have succeed in making it work or not (have webpack named chunks for lazy loaded comp using only the new router, and not the depracated one).

571,2016-05-07 21:06:06,"Hi,

I ran your project and everything works fine. However, when I did a more simplified version of Webpack + Angular2 I got the following problem:

When defining a component with requiring html template like this: 

@Component({
selector: 'test',
template: require('./test.component.html')
})

I get the following error:

Error:(22, 12) TS2345: Argument of type '{ selector: string; template: {}; directives: Type[][]; }' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ selector?: string; inputs?: string[]; outputs?: string[]; properties?: string[]; events?: strin...'.
Types of property 'template' are incompatible.
Type '{}' is not assignable to type 'string'.

I fix it by using: 
@Component({
selector: 'test',
template: """" + require('./test.component.html') + """"
})

In your project you have home.component.ts configured like this and it works without warning.

How did you solve this issue as it works perfectly without warning in your project? 

Thanks

I had a library of components developed following the oficial angular documentation based on SystemJs. It used ""import javascript_file.js"" to load external javascript files and worked. Tried to port to new webpack version and it doesnt work at all. Also, the size of the app loaded by the browser went from 2.7 MB to 3.3.

The last news I have are the new version jumps from 2 to 4. Angular project it's a chaos that seems to have lost the north. It is bloated and over engineering. I'm going to change to React.",YagoLopez,
570,2017-01-28 22:25:19,"it really seems that the angular2 team does not care about existing implementations using their framework. In my opinion Angular2 will be great one day but actually it is nearly unusable. Not at least because of the 3rd party libraries. I know, this is not their fault at all but they are changing their framework really often and they do not update the docs in time. Last week i did an update for several angular2 tools and nothing worked until i downgraded it again. 
SystemJS produces a lot of errors at my place while webpack seems to work as expected....mostly. 

But to be fair: The angular2 developers clearly say that this is still a very early version and its still beta. I think when they release the first stable version those errors will vanish....hopefully.",messerbill,
570,2017-02-02 22:36:57,"After a lot of investigation i managed to use webpack and systemjs at the same time. In my very personal opinion recompile each time with webpack during development time is clearly overkill. You should at least have the chance of using both and be able to switch without problems, but at first instance they are incompatible. Webpack sould be used for production.

@messerbill It seems the latest version of typescript enable to include external libraries easier not forcing you to declare types so strictly but then you have to manage the way of load them as webpack plugins.  Also my version of webstorm throws errors with the latest typescript. Im trapped lol.

Typescript and Web components are good idea but so many moving parts and so much bloated code.... For example, using angular-cli you end having aaaaall testing frameworks duplicated as angular dependencies and angular-cli dependencies (jasmine, protractor, karma, selenium webdriver). May be npm is the culprit. It is needed more stability and clear guides. Supposedly Angular 2 have been ended beta phase and have been released as stable version.

You can take a look to the code at https://yagolopez.github.io/material-light/. It is a material desing library. May be you can find it useful. Greetings.",YagoLopez,

564,2016-05-04 01:24:44,"I'm having a weird problem with npm install.

I have a project forked from this repo. A couple of weeks ago I did a regular merge with this repo.

Since then I have been unable to successfully run npm install. It fails at

`npm run typings -- install`

with the error:

`Unknown dependency: github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/commit/31e6e105227e2e23686c3183bddf7c91f7f5b311`

The weird part is that if I clone my github copy of the fork it works. (My github copy of the fork is only a lightly modified fork of the original – I have another separate repo that has my working project) I spent most of yesterday trying to track down this issue. I have compared every file I think could possibly have a bearing on this – but all the config, typings and package files are identical between my working project and the repo that does work.

The last thing I did yesterday was to copy the package.json file to a new, empty directory and run `npm install` from this directory.

I get exactly the same error.

Has anyone got any ideas about what I might be doing wrong?

From angular's change log:

injectAsync is now deprecated. Instead, use the async function to wrap any asynchronous tests.
You will also need to add the dependency 'node_modules/zone.js/dist/async-test.js' as a served file in your Karma or other test configuration.

Before:

it('should wait for returned promises', injectAsync([FancyService], (service) => {
  return service.getAsyncValue().then((value) => { expect(value).toEqual('async value'); });
}));
it('should wait for returned promises', injectAsync([], () => {

}));
After:

it('should wait for returned promises', async(inject([FancyService], (service) => {
  service.getAsyncValue().then((value) => { expect(value).toEqual('async value'); });

// Note that if there is no injection, we no longer need `inject` OR `injectAsync`.

  Currently Typescript helper functions such as __decorate, __extend, etc. are emitted in each module.  These modules can never reach 100% code coverage because they have browser specific checks.

Basically, I've copied your repository, but with a few changes.

I have basically your same app.spec:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

same app:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

same karma:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

same spec-bundle

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

and same webpack test:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The error seems to come from when I inject the app, but I don't understand why. I am able to test services and stuff, so I think karma and webpack are fine. Somehow, though, the inject function isn't working.

I believe all relevant dependencies are up to date with yours too:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Can anyone tell me why this might not be working?

  [X ] question about the decisions made in the repository
- **What is the current behavior?**

I just cloned the Angular 2 Webpack Starter, and tried it in WebStorm 11.
It mostly works, but **WebStorm complains and underlines some module import names**.

The reason is the Angular 2 Webpack Starter imports directories, not file names.
e.g. `import {Home} from './home'`, instead of `import {Home} from './home/index'`

My question is:

> Is the import of directories a standard TypeScript feature?
> If not, why is it implemented in this otherwise excellent repo, as it is sure to trigger validation errors in IDEs like WebStorm?
> If the import of directories **is** standard TypeScript, please advise, so I can report this issue to the WebStorm team.
- **What is the expected behavior?**
- this repo to keep to standard TypeScript features;
-  WebStorm IDE to be aware of all standard TypeScript features;
- **Other information** (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)

I posted about this in SO:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36665683/angular-2-webpack-starter-gives-cannot-resolve-errors-for-imports/36667004#36667004
",manioube,2016-04-17 06:38:14
516,2016-04-17 06:38:14,"On how TypeScript resolves modules:

""
An import statement like import { b } from ""**./moduleB**"" in /root/src/moduleA.ts would result in attempting the following locations for locating ""./moduleB"":
- /root/src/moduleB.ts
- /root/src/moduleB.ts
- /root/src/moduleB.tsx
- /root/src/moduleB.d.ts
- /root/src/moduleB/package.json (if it specifies a ""typings"" property)
- /root/src/**moduleB/index.ts**
- /root/src/moduleB/index.tsx
- /root/src/moduleB/index.d.ts
  ""

[http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html](http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html)

So it seems it is a standard TypeScript feature, [dating from TypeScript 1.6](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap), to look resolve to `./module/index.ts` when `./module` is imported.

It seems that Angular 2 Webpack Starter was using correctly a standard TypeScript feature, which would mean that WebStorm 11 has no cause for complaining.

I will then ask the WebStorm team how to solve this issue...

You don't need to specify the `main` in here. What webpack is going to do is create a hierarchy (making vendor to be the parent of `main`) and having that `main` there won't add any value. The minChunks is not needed for the current config.

Also, you could drop the reverse helper and just swap the chunks positions.

FWIW, Webpack is smart enough to order the chunks like: polyfills -> vendor -> main so for HtmlWebpackPlugin there is no real need to manually order the chunks.

Cheers.

Thanks for your replies! Everything clear so far.. but, how would i turn off css encapsulation for a component?

My problem is, i try to use Sass together with Bootstrap. I know it would be perfect in ES6 modules to import the css for every component directly in the components code. But then i don't know all the variables/classes inside my component script - then i have to import everything needed over and over again in every component (which is not wrong as i read about ES6 modules). But this results in having bootstrap included several times in the final package - and then i have to de-dup everything? This feels totally wrong to me.

So i got another approach - i'm importing my scss only at one single point in the whole app - in my bootstrapping ""main.browser.ts"" -> and my basic scss is importing bootstrap, and all subsequent scss files of all components. This way i end up having all classes/variables everywhere available and i import boostrap only once and don't have to de-dup in the end. Now the only thing ""disturbing"" here is the css encapsulation i guess.

Isn't the encapsulation controlled by the imports...? Or is there really an optional flag or something for my webpack configuration?
",rvetere,2016-04-03 13:16:19
492,2016-04-02 20:24:13,"Encapsulation is controlled by the angular components themselves. You would set on your component : 

encapsulation : ViewEncapsulation.None,

You can also set ViewEncapsulation.Emulated (default) or ViewEncapsulation.Native (shadowDom)

491,2016-04-02 02:15:51,"This is a **bug report**
### Overview

Changes made in `angular2-hmr 0.5.3` cause a failure in browser in prod builds of `angular2-webpack-starter`.  I'm not sure if this is ultimately something to fix here or in `angular2-hmr`, though it can be temporarily alleviated here by forcing the dependency if anybody else is affected.
### Steps to reproduce
- Checkout `angular2-webpack-starter` at revision `f78aeb4`, and install all dependencies
- Run `npm ls angular2-hmr` - if it is not `0.5.4` then run `npm install angular2-hmr@0.5.4` to force it (and then check with `npm ls`)
- Run `npm run build:prod && npm run server:prod`
- Open browser, go to `localhost:8080`, nothing will load. Look at dev console, see error:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
### Diagnosis

The error doesn't occur in `angular2-hmr` version `0.5.2`:
- `npm install angular2-hmr@0.5.2` to force that version
- `npm run build:prod && npm run server:prod`
- Open browser, see that everything loads without any errors.

`angular2-hmr` seems to be looking for the `process` global, which doesn't exist in the browser.  This code was introduced in v0.5.3 (https://github.com/gdi2290/angular2-hmr/commit/fed06b8)
### Temporary Fix

Locally, I have updated my `package.json` to force the `angular2-hmr` dependency to `=0.5.2`.  I'll submit a bug and PR to `angular-hmr` to make that check more lenient.
### Environment
- Angular version: 2.0.0-beta.13
- Browser: all

  [x] bug report
  [ ] feature request
  [ ] question about the decisions made in the repository
- **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**
  It feels like a bug to me but i don't want to stress anybody - the HMR thing is still in developement i guess and maybe it is just work-in-progress..?
- **What is the current behavior?**
  Three weeks ago i've initialized a new project with this skeleton project - and the css livereload was working fine. By livereload i mean, he can inject the new css directly into the browser without reloading the page. Now i've upgraded my project with all the new changes and the livereload is broken now, he always reloads the page - on css changes and in typescript (in typescript it was kind of working with the HMR back those days.. it wasn't made with this new angular2-hmr package).
- **Steps to reproduce**
- 1. checkout the repo as a new project and `npm i`, `npm start`
  1. goto `localhost:3000`
  2. open up home.css for example and add some css like `body { color: red; }`
  3. watch webpack rebuilding the package and as soon as he is ready -> the page reloads
- **What is the expected behavior?**
  page should not reload at least with css - what the state is with HMR i don't really know.
- **Please tell us about your environment:**
- Angular version: 2.0.0-beta.13
- latest variant for now with HMR 0.5.1

- **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**
  feature
- **What is the current behavior?**
  it is too big, bloated, bulky.
- **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
  https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).
- **What is the expected behavior?**
  I want a version of angular2-webpack-starter that is minimal.  It should have only angular2 and webpack, not 4 million other things.  (especially test.  really don't need any test harnesses built into ""how to angular2 webpack"" setup)
  All test code and libraries should be removed.
  All unneeded files should be removed.
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
  so I won't be confused and bedazzled by things I don't need to learn Angular2 and Webpack.

So what I like with angular2-seed is with this code:

I get an error something like http doesn't have type defined. This really helps with RxJS chain of operators when it difficult sometimes to see what you got inside of a particular operator.

If you want a simple example with just Ng2 and Webpack, I really think there are other and better seeds out there. 

But this seed is by far the best and closest to a ""real world"" setup and I very much appreciate it. 

We can't have it all..

Personally, what I do is that I base my projects around this seed. Then I manually remove or change the things that suit my project best. I've learnt a ton just understanding the different part of this project.

You really shouldn't use stuff like this without at least understanding what's going on. And it's a great excercise to use this project as a ""starter"" (hense the project name) and then do your own modifications. It's a relative simple matter to remove the stuff you don't need, and in the proces learning about the stuff.

Just my opinion of course.

I like the prod/dev config of this repo and the fact that config files are separated, but use the package.json from the seed and add dependencies that I need instead of like before using this one and removing.

Perhaps making sure the naming is consistent, like custom-typings.d.ts in one vs typings.d.ts and the entry points are the same like app.ts in one vs main.browser.ts in the other. Since when I merge with git if the name/location is not the same it's not as smooth. Also maybe using a webpack.common that's in common with both repo might be helpful, and using helper.js in both to calculate the root in webpack. In the end I would aim for as little difference between the two repos as necessary. However, all of this is just little things. Wouldn't want to add extra work for just my own preference.

472,2016-04-01 13:38:47,"I was going to open an issue relating to path location strategy, but it might be more appropriate here. Maybe @spawnius can help me out. I'm using path location strategy. On my server, nginx is handling incoming requests and sending them off to either the front-end server or the backend (api) server. I can't get non-root routes to work on refresh without specifying all routes like the `location /about` block below: 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

If I remove the `location /about` block, then the `/about` route can not be directly accessed. If I visit `/` and navigate to `/about`, all will be fine, but on a refresh I'll get a 404 in the server logs. With the block, however, refreshes work as expected. Also, I don't understand how dynamic uri's (e.g. `/users/3`) can work out between nginx and path location strategy.

Any ideas?

  loading app fails intermittently with error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined
  ![stacktrace](https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/2rrtmKqn.png)

started a week or so ago when I upgraded from around the beta.8 versions. In the mean time I've tried starting from a fresh copy of the starter, it'll work fine for a while but eventually it'll fail on that error. Sometimes it'll fail after just adding a new <div> to an HTML template, or even just restarting the dev server

eventually the error is on this line:
modules[moduleId].call(module.exports, module, module.exports, hotCreateRequire(moduleId));

 it appears intermittently and seems to be random, it'll work one minute, and then fail the next. Making a couple changes (to nothing in particular) and restarting the dev server sometimes fixes it. And other times the app will be working fine but simply restarting the dev server will produce the error.

the same code also works fine when in a JSPM based build

Facing the same issue and it is intermittent.
With the earlier releases (till Angular 2 Beta 9) it was working fine and we are using Bootstrap, jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery Datepicker, Timepicker and Date range picker without any issues.

When we update to recent commits (with Beta 11) we are facing the same issue as mentioned by @ryneflood 

We tried this
- Running `npm run server:dev`
- Disabled entire jQuery and all it's plugins : Working fine.
- When we move to pages where jQuery used : it is giving error like jQuery not found
- Enabled jQuery using ProvidePlugin in Webpack config and re-run `npm run server:dev` : jQuery found.
- When we move to pages where jQuery UI Datepicker is used : jQuery(...).datepicker(....) not found
- Imported jQuery UI along with other plugins in `main.browser.ts`
- Browser refreshed and all are working fine.
- Stopped `npm run server:dev`
- Re-run `npm run server:dev`
- Getting `Cannot read property 'call' of undefined` error. Which was working fine previously

Tried to debug the error and found Webpack moduleId (170 in our case) not found and modules[moduleId] returning undefined.

Tried developer tool's Error call stack : it is showing error in the first line of `main.browser.ts`

Any suggestions on debugging this issue would be great.

I'm currently using PostCSS as outlined here: https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-include-PostCSS , but it also affects using SASS as suggested here: https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-include-SCSS-in-components
The error also occurs when require()'ing vanilla CSS using the 'raw-loader' which is included by default in the webpack config file

If I remove all instances where I require() css in components the issue goes away

Let me know if I can provide any more details to help get this fixed up!

In webpack.config.js I uncomment vendors in:

And replace line:

`new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ template: 'src/index.html', chunksSortMode: 'none' }),`
by

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And replace this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

By this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Then I replace body of helpers.js file (in the same directory than webpack.config.js in my version - but in current wersion this and other files was moved to 'config' directory) to this

But I change line (becouse in my version helpers.js file is in the same directory than webpack.config.js) :
`var _root = path.resolve(__dirname, '..');`
To
`var _root = path.resolve(__dirname, '.');`

  The webpack configuration has been changed so that components of the configuration that is shared between production and development are now in one file. It makes the files more cohesive and easier to update. 

I've tried introducing this before, but was rejected on grounds of complexity. I would like to argue that this configuration is yes slightly more complex (not anymore complex than other parts of this starter pack) but makes it much easier to to merge in changes from this repo into existing projects. Not only does it allow you put your custom loaders in a single file, but also the ""config"" object having the ability to be passed around means that you can merge changes from this repo much easier without breaking some ""application specific"" changes.
- **What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)
  There is a lots of duplicate code in the webpack configurations.
- **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**
  Made the webpack conmfiguration more dry, and more scalable.
- **Other information**:
  I've been trying to stay up to date with the latest polyfills, and beta versions of Angular while developing an application, It's important to me that I am able to quickly apply changes made in this repo to my own applications. This PR would make that process much faster for me.

452,2016-03-27 19:10:20,"@tobek thanks, the compiler needs `zone.js.d.ts`

but, its not that easy to fix it, because if you check the current [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/tsconfig.json#L10) node_modules are excluded, even if you add `./node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js.d.ts` to `filesGlob` it won't gain any precedence over the node_modules exclusion. If you remove the node_modules exclusion you will get a bunch of duplicate identifier errors

Nevertheless `./src/custom-typings.d.ts` is not a wise decision: 
- what if in the future you will have to define several dozen of libs? 
- what if you want to define them good not just to shut the compiler up? that single file will grow very big
- what if you want to temporary load `./node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js.d.ts`?

I think it would be wiser to create `./manual-typings/` and place all the custom `.d.ts` file there and load this folder. This is where i added the missing `zone.js.d.ts` file. So, [something like this.](https://github.com/tsm91/ng2-starter-kit/commit/5c781dab938d53fff0d18376e582e639a026394e)

After that you should be able to import jQuery as `import 'jquery';`. I briefly checked it so most likely not the cleanest solution. Hope it helps though.

412,2016-03-11 15:02:59,"hi @daddywoodland @alvipeo 
Just to make some things clear ( perhaps also for other visitors in the future ), you are not doing E2E tests. You're unit testing a service where you are mocking out your dependencies ( in this case the XHRBackend service )
",samvloeberghs,
412,2016-03-11 15:35:27,"Hi @samvloeberghs,

The terminology does trigger some interesting conversations.  

As you say it's a unit test but not of a service, I'm testing a unit of behaviour within my UI (port level testing).

Protractor is my mechanism for accessing the closed system to test a behaviour, and since Protractor is always labelled as an end to end testing tool, I mistakenly used the term.  

Either way, I'm after a Protractor, not Karma solution to this problem :o)

Cheers,
",daddywoodland,
412,2016-03-11 22:06:27,"I actually do integration tests, not unit tests (well, rarely I do them too). That's the way that works best for me. So Karma is in my case.
",alvipeo,
412,2016-03-16 13:36:39,"I've been looking at this on and off for the last few days without making much progress.  I think the technique suggested above (and everywhere else on t'internet) involves configuring the injection before the component/service is initialised.  However as protractor is running tests against an app that's already running it's not working.

I'm going to look at initialising the application with the mock backend in place so that I can configure mocked responses on a test by test basis.
",daddywoodland,
412,2016-03-16 13:59:12,"In the past I've done this by mocking my backend with a node-red implementation. By setting a flag that was then triggering the initialisation of this mocked API and redirecting/proxying the API address to that mocked API. 

But that said: When doing E2E tests you should keep the mocking to the minimum, trying to avoid it completely. E2E testing explicitly means that you test end to end, real app till real backend.

If you don't want to polute your production DB for example, you should have a staging or dev server running next to your UAT or prod environment, where you test against regressions. Perhaps use docker to instantiate a setup on the fly, ..
",samvloeberghs,
412,2016-03-16 14:04:21,"To elaborate on your last comment: It's indeed hard and probably unneeded to change the app implementation on runtime. What you could do is change the environment. While running your protractor config, proxy the requests and point them to the mocked API

-> run protractor, set flag
-> if flag set, setup proxy
-> call to http://real.api.com, going trough proxy, proxy it to http://mocked.api.com
-> protractor done, unset flag
-> destroy proxy

Just some quick thoughts :)
",samvloeberghs,
412,2016-03-16 16:21:45,"Thanks @samvloeberghs I'll take that into account when trying out mocking the HTTP response.  I was looking at json-server as a possible solution for mocking the API.

Regarding the reference to 'E2E', these aren't end to end tests but unit tests of the behaviour of the front end as a closed component.  I've seen it called 'port level testing', 'sociable unit tests' and 'behavioural unit testing'.  

Ultimately I need to mock any requests that move across the boundary of my component, in this case calls the the API.

If you're unfamiliar and are interested in the idea, the approach was triggered from a talk by Ian Cooper I saw a couple of years ago.  I didn't see this one at NDC 2013 but it's the same presentation I believe.

Cheers!

I use for the devServer an proxy and it works great, anything which comes from /api/\* will be redirect to my server.

so this
`this.http.post('/api/v1/sensors'`

will redirected to
`http://192.168.1.1/abc/api/v1/sensors''`

but how can I do the same thing for Websockets?
`this.ws = new WebSocket('ws://api/v1/sensorsws');`

thx

I want to set the initial state of a checkbox based the initial state of the data object.

Eg the data object may have an attribute ""isAvailable"" so I want to set the checkbox to match the value of isAvailable.

The problem I am having is that to set the initial state of a check box to checked you add the ""checked"" attribute to the form control.

(This seems silly as it would seem better to have used checked=""true"" as you can read the value of the checkbox by reading its ""checked"" value. Anyway that's not the way it is.)

This strange behavior becomes clear when you look at the packed webpack file. Basically process does not get added to the global scope what so ever. Webpack does a search and replace for anything that is process.env and fills it in with that object specifically everywhere. So essentially it is a new instance of that config object every time. I think this was to not pollute the global space, but for minify purposes seems like a waste.

Is there a option to make it part of the global namespace?

  - If it happens in dev mode AOT has nothing to do with it.
  - If you are aliasing packages that are in DLLs (even though it makes no sense) make sure to include it in the DLL webpack config

I assume it's none of the abode...

Aliasing is a simple feature in webpack, it get's complex when you have 2 or more processes that requires context. The more process the more things to do... 

Webpack in dev + TS = 2 processes
Webpack in prod + AOT + TS = 3 processes!

The alias in webpack gives context for resolving modules within webpack, it will not pass those aliases to TypeScript since it runs on a different context.

You need to explicitly set these paths for TypeScript.

Setting it in the `paths` in `tsconfig` is only good for AOT compilation using the angular compiler... since webpack isn't involved for TS module resolution.

You also need to set it in Webpack via a plugin, telling the TS loader to apply the paths.

Usually this simple setup will do:
<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Just put it in common, make sure the paths in the tsconfig file are correct.
You can pretty much apply all types of aliasing, I did crazy stuff...

The reason you need a plugin is for the loader to be able to map files between  Webpack and TS.
You can also send a custom configuration to the plugin, see the awesome loader site.",shlomiassaf,2016-03-13 04:50:14

Does anyone have any idea?",rochapablo,2016-03-13 04:50:14

So you have already this:
`const TsConfigPathsPlugin = require('awesome-typescript-loader').TsConfigPathsPlugin;`

...and that (in ""plugins""):
`new TsConfigPathsPlugin(),`

... in webpack.common.js?

Not really sure, but I do not have trailing backslashes on alias configuration, so I do use `helpers.root('src/app')` instead of `'src/app/'`

Did you remember to set tsconfig paths to both tsconfig.json and tsconfig.webpack.json?

Also I do set the ""baseUrl"" in tsconfig, though maybe it doesn't affect the situation you have:
`    ""baseUrl"": ""./src"",
    ""paths"": {
      ""app/*"": [
        ""app/*""
      ]
    },`",rvalimaki,2016-03-13 04:50:14

For testing, we can use _ts-node_ for _AVA_,

then we dont need to transpile typescript via _Webpack_,

Look in the webpack.config.js down around line 72 in the plugins section. Maybe you can copy that line and adjust it for your needs. But I'd say you are going off the seed's prescribed path.

I've been following the guidelines from [here](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-do-I-async-load-a-component-with-AsyncRoute) to get the Async Components loading working with no success.

Using this method you don't need to edit two files when you add a loader, or change a plugin. They are using the same configuration file and that makes it much more DRY!

Although I like the idea of configuration and the DRY principle, separating the config files gives you more flexibility and readability ( depending on the environment), with the little compromise of having to repeat yourself.

I'd be happy to have a go at implementing it but I've got no idea how to go about it in webpack.

It looks like I would have to add a loader in webpack.config and then a require in my code. But I'm really only thrashing around in the dark.

I'm sure I solved this problem recently but I can't remember how.

Yesterday I tried running Angular 2.0.0 beta 5 but it gave me lots of errors so I just switched back to beta 3. This gave me even more errors so I ended up deleting my whole node-modules directory and re-installing.

After this most of my errors went away but now I am getting stack of errors in the /typings/browser/ambient/ directory.

This doesn't seen to affect anything when I run from the web pack server but when I try to build, the build result doesn't produce anything meaningful when I run it from a browser. (FYI I get 
`Loading... <% if (webpackConfig.metadata.ENV === 'development') { %> <% } %>`)

First of all: thank you a lot for creating this awesome starter package, it sure helped me to understand how BDD can't run with Jasmine alone - especially if you are going to test in typescript.

I'm talking about the current `app.spec.ts` example, there is describe missing in the import.

https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/src/app/app.spec.ts
Otherwise, Jasmine will not be able to find describe.

In home.spec.ts you should add `describe` to the list of imports.

I found other tests that do not have sufficient providers/imports.

test/sanity-test.spec.ts
test/injector.spec.ts
etc

307,2016-02-07 09:23:48,"Hi,

When executing ""npm run build:prod"" the webpack.prod.config.js file is used. Within that file we have two entry points given:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The output has three bundles: main.js, polyfills.js and 1.js.
When looking more closely the 1.js contains the about.async.ts file - why is that separated into its own bundle and why is it called ""1""?
When trying to separate it into a named bundle, like this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Then I get an error that about.async.ts is already referenced from app.ts (which is referenced from main.ts). Resources that are included in one entry point cannot be specified as separate entry points. I understand this error but I do not understand why it is not bundled with main.ts in the first case?

I assume that it is because the about.async.ts file is loaded asynchronously which is great! Is this built-in black magic in webpack? When .async is in the file name, it is loaded async and these bundles will be called 1.js, 2.js, 3.js and so forth?

To confuse things even more, I don't really understand how commonchunksplugin is configured in this project. What is the purpose of this plugin?

298,2016-02-05 10:49:12,"Hi,

In my project I have a structure like

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

In models.ts I do something like

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

to give a single import point for the rest of the code to all model types.

Now, I am writing a test for a service, that includes a model, like so:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And the associated test:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Running karma on this gives an error with:

> Chrome 48.0.2564 (Mac OS X 10.11.2) LOG: 'TypeError: Cannot read property 'toString' of undefined'
> Chrome 48.0.2564 (Mac OS X 10.11.2) ERROR

> 
> (same for PhantomJS)

However, if I change my include in TestService.ts to read

`import {Foo} from '../../models/Foo';`

then the test runs.

What could cause this behaviour?

During normal runtime, everything works with the /models/models import. It only fails during test.

When it (the array) is present, the testsuite fails to start. If absent (removed from bootstrap.ts), the test-suite works.

It seems to not matter, if the array contains anything or not.

This extension is usable and allows you to set breakpoints in VS Code, but configuring it correctly is still a pain. Webpack-dev-server puts the transpiled .js files in a virtual filesystem so the sourcemaps can't map the lines correctly to your typescript without some work. Still experimenting.

You'll need to change launch.json in vscode to the following

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And finally, you can run npm run build:dev, followed by npm run server:prod to output the build files to dist and get http-server to load from that. Note that you won't be using webpack-dev-server, so you lose the auto-refresh capabilities. You'll have to manually build:dev again whenever you make a code change.

It will work great in the development environment, But it failed to find the _stylesheet_ in the `production` environment. 

If you pull down my test [repo](https://github.com/mattma/angular2-webpack-starter). And if you run `npm start`, it works great. but after you run `npm run build:prod`, `npm run server:prod`. and then you open in the browser, you will see the error below:

I am sure that it could be fixed by a couple of configurations of webpack. All we need here, is embedded stylesheet inline in the javascript file, at the same time, avoid the Typescript error `2374 -> Duplicate number index signature`. Any idea?

Can I ask you questions? 

Is there any drawback on opt-out **angular2** styles? What about `ViewEncapsulation.None`, `ViewEncapsulation.Emulated`,`ViewEncapsulation.Native`, do I still get the benefit what Angular2 offers?

When I opt-in webpack way, what did webpack do for the style? does webpack concat all component styles into one giant stylesheet? or does it still stay individual pack and embedded as string into component javascript?

thanks a lot.

281,2016-01-31 21:45:51,"I'm really new to all of I ended up with these changes:
First, I changed so that I have different loaders for different css. The css in the angular2 app structure are nice to include with a raw-loader and the require() on the css files. The other css files, such as bootstrap3 are nice to bundle into a styles.css so that it can load in parallell to the javascript, thus minimizing FOUC.
First I add extract-text-webpack-plugin so that it can be used to bundle css files. This is then used in the loaders section of the webpack.config.js:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Notice the include/exclude statements.
Second, I output the bundled css files into styles.css using this code:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

With the current structure, my assets/css/app.css is still copied to the dist with the copy-webpack-plugin with this line:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I'm not entirely sure on how to handle that yet, so far it isn't a problem but I could either move the css folder out of assets, somehow exclude it from copy-webpack-plugin or just ignore it. Currently I'm just ignoring it.

Last but not least I import the css files that I want to include in the bundle. I'm doing this in polyfills.ts like this:

first of all great job.. this starter kit is amazing.
I'm trying to run:
npm run watch:test

As expected chrome open a new window, I can press debug button, in the console it show the error but the problem is that is impossible to debug the code because it just load the spec-bundle.js.
There's a way to put a breakpoint in my code?

For backbone, it looks like you should install https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/backbone/backbone-global.d.ts instead. You can open issues at https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues to fix these definitions and so you can import the module `jointjs`.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to import jointjs via;

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

only simple require('jointjs') was possible, but its not what I wanted to.

So I decided to write my own typings in custom_typings.d.ts

Basically I just copied their joitn definition in my project... and I saw that their module definitions starts with

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

After some googling I changed `declare module joint` to `declare module ""jointjs""` in my own declaration. And import warnings are gone. But I still had to reference jointjs peer dependencies manually.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong here... And coming back to their typings. What the difference between:
`declare module joint` vs `declare module ""jointjs"" { export = joint; module joint { ...`
probably I was able to get out from import errors only because I added export ?

273,2016-01-31 10:22:35,"Including UI frameworks like Semantic UI is not as straightforward because you need to take care of UI components that require JS and include these appropriately as Webpack modules. 

Possible solutions... I will write a Wiki once I have something to demo.
1. You may want to checkout Wiki written for [including Bootstrap 4](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-use-Bootstrap-4-and-Sass-%28and-jQuery%29) for ideas.
2. You may want to use CSS only version of semantic UI and include it straight within the index.html 
3. Use Sass Loader with [Semantic UI Scss version](https://github.com/doabit/semantic-ui-sass) to include specific components as required. [Like so](https://github.com/manavsehgal/AngularPages/tree/master/src/app). The AngularPages demo has app level Scss theme, and component level Sass styling integration.

1. adding jade to loader

`
{ test: /\.jade$/,  loader: 'jade' }

for implementation just call by require like this

`
@Component({

Stepping into code of external packages will step into actual runtime code as supplied to the browser.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

In for code above, stepping into `render.setElementStyle` will go to an instruction showing ES5 transpiled code, not the TypeScript code. This makes it hard to understand what happens and what the angular code wants to do.

This PR adds a webpack `preLoader` that handles the mapping so webpack will use the included sourcemaps in the angular2 package.

Only angular2 source maps added to the configuration with instructions on how to add more.

Add all of the `node_modules` directory is:
A) Build performance hit.
B) Emit `WARNING` messages from `rxjs` package, some sourcemap files are missing there.

I think angular2 is enough, it will help all starters to better understand the framework.

Can we combine the function import together with the ES6 import statement below in the file?

My understanding is that all required objects from `angular2/core` still will be bundled since the application code explicitly imports everything it needs. However I lack the knowledge of Webpack's bundling process and concerned that some of the objects from `angular2/core` can leak into the `bundle.js` file instead of being in `vendor.bundle.js`.

I did a quick experiment it seems that everything is fine, works as intended, but maybe I'm missing a common case when it won't work. What do you think?

In my project I've installed `angular2-jwt` module (using npm so it's in `node_modules` folder).
In `localhost:3000` everything works but when I hit `npm test` I have error `Error: Cannot find module ""angular2-jwt/angular2-jwt""`

I copied the contents of their `dist/feathers.js` to my `assets/lib/feathers.js`. Currently this implementation works well by using `declare const feathers;` at the top of the files where I need to use feathers. However, I think it's not a very pretty solution.

215,2016-02-24 17:08:25,"So I set this up without postcss, but what is the proper way to pull in scss files into my components?

In my component:
`@Component({
  selector: 'about',
  templateUrl: 'app/components/about/about.html',
  styles: [require('./about.scss')],
  providers: [Mockable],
  directives: [MockableList, ROUTER_DIRECTIVES],
  pipes: []
})
`

In my webpack.config.js in loaders array:
`{ test: /\.scss$/, loaders: ['style', 'css', 'sass'] },`

I am getting an error 

> EXCEPTION: TypeError: s.replace is not a function

So I tried to change the loader to this:
`{ test: /\.scss$/, loader: 'raw-loader!sass-loader' },`

Which got rid of the error, but my css is rendered with encapsulation and looks like my component is not encapsulated:
`body.test[_ngcontent-gpk-3] {
  background: red; }
  body.test[_ngcontent-gpk-3] h3[_ngcontent-gpk-3] {
    color: #FFF; }
  body.test[_ngcontent-gpk-3] a[_ngcontent-gpk-3] {
    color: #FFF; }`

So what would be the best way to have a ""global"" scss stylesheet, and then use component scss stylesheets together? I think I have gotten the global part, by turning off viewEncapsulation on the root app, but then do I need to turn it on for every single component inside the app to get the styles to work properly?

I guess basically I am asking how to overwrite the css for the body tag from a component stylesheet.
",jgrannas,2016-01-11 23:51:37
215,2016-03-30 18:36:48,"@jgrannas - Not sure if this is what you're referring to, but I have it set up to use a global `main.scss` file located in a separate directory called `/assets/scss`. That main SCSS file is referenced in the main/top-level `AppComponent`. It can then import other SCSS files like `_common.scss`. Even though viewEncapsulation is turned off for the primary component I can still require SCSS files for specific components and it works fine.

Try using the following for the loaders in your `webpack.config.js`:
`loaders: ['raw-loader', 'sass-loader']`

See what I have and maybe it will help:
- AppComponent: https://github.com/kahboom/apiman/blob/dev-portal/devportal/war/src/app/app.component.ts#L23

Also not sure if this is how @lpalli did it or was what he referring to, but I was able to integrate jQuery, Bootstrap 4, and Sass without using the `bootstrap-loader`, instead using the `sass-loader` and `raw-loader` as dev dependencies installed with npm, since I was also using Sass for each component. I added the following to the `config/webpack.common.js` file, under `module.exports[module][loaders]`:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Then under `module.exports[plugins]` I added the following (I needed c3 and d3, but you could leave those out):

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And then would reference SCSS files from the component (ie `src/app/dashboard/dashboard.component.ts`) like this:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The bad thing about this is that you lose the benefits of Angular 2's `ViewEncapsulation`, which means I have to `require()` each SCSS file within the component at the top of the file instead of within the Component decorator (using `ViewEncapsulation`) as of Webpack 2. I'm okay with that, as I don't see the huge benefit yet, but am still looking at other solutions to keep things the ""Angular way"". I'm also biased toward Node.js and am used to just `require()`ing things. Global SCSS files (if you have one or two) can be resolved by adding it to the loader chain with `require('!!style!css!sass!./example.scss')`, for example, but that's a whole other issue.

If you're interested in a working reference, you can see the repo I'm working on with the changes [here](https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio-ipaas), or just my personal fork that gets updated a bit more frequently [here](https://github.com/kahboom/hawtio-ipaas). It uses the latest changes in `angular2-webpack-starter` with Webpack 2, no Angular Material, just Bootstrap and a pattern library that uses Bootstrap under the covers called PatternFly (optional). Just my preference because I personally dislike Angular Material. To try it out:

i am unsure if this is the optimal solution, however it is specified in the [README](https://github.com/justindujardin/ng2-material/blob/master/public/font/README.md) for the ng2-material public font that this is the recommended way to use material fonts. with that being said, i didnt actually read too deeply into the Google Material Icons Guide that is linked to from that README, which appears to specify instructions for self hosting the fonts.

I'm trying to integrate angular2 translate as an addon to the starter kit but I'm facing some difficulties. 
Check the issue here: https://github.com/ocombe/ng2-translate/issues/11

It's basically the assets/i18n folder not serving apparently?

Just asking if you guys have  a quick thought and answer to it before I dig into code.

Is it an idea to run webdriver:update/start automatically when running the e2e tests?
It is an dependency to it so it would be a good idea, right?

So:
npm run e2e
   -> ./node_modules/.bin/webdriver-manager update
   -> ./node_modules/.bin/webdriver-manager start
   -> ./node_modules/.bin/protractor

I also had the impression that protractor should automatically start and/or update webdriver?

Angular community has a choice of UI frameworks to consider. Bootstrap, Semantic UI, Ionic, Material UI... among others. Can we showcase (with sample components, webpack integration...) integration of one UI framework using best practices followed by the starter...
- Using Scss in modular way - selective UI framework components for minimal payload.
- Integrating UI framework JS modules honoring Angular and Webpack requirements.

We need to vote on one such framework for integration, before considering the implementation.
- Bootstrap, Material will most likely be implemented in a project similar to Angular Bootstrap or Angular Material...
- Ionic is self-contained and already implementing Angular 2 + Ionic 2 integration on their own...
- Among the UI frameworks I find Semantic UI to be most comprehensive and flexible in terms of integration and customization surface...

https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-use-Bootstrap-4-and-Sass-(and-jQuery)

You should not use bootstrap-sass package since it is bootstrap 3. And use config file `.bootstraprc` to tell bootstrap-loader that it is bootstrap v4 (which already contains scss files): https://github.com/shakacode/bootstrap-loader/blob/master/.bootstraprc-4-default

I will try to figure it out myself but it will take some time.

**UPDATE:** :white_check_mark:  I got it working without `bootstrap-sass` by adding the following to `main.ts`

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Without zone and reflect-metadata angular won't run. With the two lines included it runs but I got some other weird errors which I will ignore for now.

serviceworker is so exciting. I wish there were a way to implement with ng2 without having to work in any ng2 specific parts as seen here: https://github.com/robwormald/ng2-application-shell .. but I don't think there is.

I like the thought of the 2 repos. I think I'm with you on thinking that a lot of company's and teams need a simple starter to pull off quick prototyping whereas having a separate more sophisticated and complete setup for large production apps is very appreciated and valuable to the community at large. Thanks for all you're doing here, it's incredibly helpful.

I'm not saying merge this actually, however this is how the naming conventions would play out here.

I've had mixed feelings about them for awhile but in general, like them.
I've just never been a big fan of long filenames which is why I'm not in love with `whatever.component.ts` vs. `whatever.ts`, however it does make things clear.
This becomes more idiomatic when you consider most conventions suggest placing files inside a folder called `components` such as shown here in this PR.
So when opening files and you see:
`app/components/home/home.component.ts`
vs.
`app/home/home.ts`

First, for large projects with more than 2-3 nested hierarchies, you would need a screen or IDE at least wide enough to show the long path and filename when you have multiple tabs open to discern the difference between 2 of the same named files in different folders, ie.:
`app/component/home/home.component.ts`
vs.
`app/component/users/profile/home.component.ts`
^ just an example but it can definitely happen ;)

But in the end, I digress. Whatever the community believes is universally great.

If this is the way to go, then by all means, merge :+1:

Kind of like Angular2 version of the famous [johnpapa angular 1 style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide). I am sure many of the recommendations can be reused for Angular 2 with few changes.

Currently I notice following issue with component naming:

Angular 2 official docs seem to suggest using `app.component.ts` and `AppComponent` naming convention. More verbose. 

PS: I have not looked up the design docs of Angular2 if there are ""official"" docs that can kickstart such a style guide.

Where missing, we can also lookup other best practices - like [API naming conventions from Apigee](https://pages.apigee.com/rs/apigee/images/api-design-ebook-2012-03.pdf) could possibly help navigation / router related naming conventions.

Currently production settings need to be commented out (debug:true) or changed (devtool: 'eval') in webpack.config between dev/prod scenarios. This is not ideal.

There are two prevalent solutions for separate webpack dev/prod configs. 
(1) Using npm webpack-merge  and environment variables to TARGET dev/prod in same config file. [SurviveJS implementation](http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/developing_with_webpack/)

I am trying to implement webpack in my own Angular2 project, using your project as an example. 
For some reason the common and vendor bundles stay very short, only calling System.register with all the required modules. Why would webpack use System.register in my case, and concatenate all required files in your case...?? I am trying to find out why.... Any hint?

Empty files section is used as starting point e.g. here:
- https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/typescript

""Entry point"" for collecting files should be app.ts (or at least it's with tsify).

The reason you get that error is because it's not referenced or included anywhere. Honestly, I wouldn't drop using the files array for any reason, even using exclude can be a pain in the ass.

Both the TypeScript compiler, tooling, Webpack, tsify, anything will resolve imports as I described above, but the compiler and tooling doesn't use tsify, it uses `tsconfig.json`. Sure, you can omit files, but then you have to use exclude instead otherwise you might end up compiling something outside the scope of the project. You end up with a blacklist instead of a whitelist.

If those are removed from tsconfig.json (meaning that the user will not end up maintaining the file most of the time), that would be fine as well.

The other option is using `exclude` and basically doing the inverse, but I prefer things to be explicit instead of implicit anyway - includes should land in `tsconfig.json` soon which will resolve this forever.

Yes, Atom and Sublime and other tooling also understands this also. But you have to exclude everything that's not meant to be included and I can tell you that's a pain sometimes and I wouldn't recommend it as the default. At a minimum, you'll have to start with `node_modules`. Also, you can't use `files` with `exclude`, which means the second some file inside of an excludes needs to be included (E.g. a module provides you an ambient declaration, such as `reflect-metadata`) you can no longer use `exclude` properly.

@tariknz How did you use the ExtractTextPlugin to achieve this? I was under the impression that Angular2 scoped the css per component using data attributes on the DOM and injecting them into the css.

Even with the `--optimize-minimize` switch the `app.js` file is still 577kB.

Looking inside `app.js` there seems to be a lot of Angular in there, when I was expecting that to be in `vendor.js`.

I'm fairly new to WebPack, so I was wondering if someone could help me understand what is happening here.  If vendor modules required by the application are being bundled into `app.js` then what is the purpose of `vendor.js`?  Or if they should not be, then why is `app.js` so large?

I am currently using node v0.12.x on which protractor 3 does not work : i have to fallback to version 2.5.1.

As such, I also faced another issue with chromedriver location : so i put some comments in the protractor conf file to guide people.

I suggest this PR as fix for people who are still using this version of node.
There is actually no specific branch where i can PR, so i PR this on master. 

Please let me know if you create a specific branch for me to PR.

Michel.

I'm a newbie for **modern** front-end development. I found it is very tricky to make this project run with VSCode debugger.

Thanks @Gabriel0402 for providing a snippet for a good start. However, the `""file:///""` path doesn't run on my OS X as described here https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug/issues/63#issuecomment-163524778 , and `webRoot` doesn't work due to an breaking change from Visual Studio Code as described https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug/issues/117#issuecomment-193774722 .

Note: DO NOT put any space in your workspace path. (3/24 updated: vscode-chrome-debug 0.2.3 fixed the space in path issue [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug/commit/9175a28a7b55e77fc48ca173e02e77ab87319884).)

For the `devtoolModuleFilenameTemplate` resolving in Windows, my colleague confirmed that he can break on his source code without any problem. Can you dump (`console.log(resourcePath)`) the resolved path for further investigation?

@skolmer In my OS X, `info.absoluteResourcePath` may be resolved as something like `node_modules/rxjs/Observable.js`, and I don't know why.

use 
`devtool: 'source-map',`
instead of
`devtool: 'cheap-module-source-map',`
in ./config/webpack.dev.js

install and use the write-file-webpack-plugin : 
`npm install --save write-file-plugin`

and add the plugin to ./config/webpack.dev.js by adding : 
`const WriteFilePlugin = require('write-file-webpack-plugin');`
under the Webpack Plugins at the top, and adding : 
`new WriteFilePlugin()`
to the list of plugins, after the DefinePlugin()

this ensures the source-maps are written to disk.
the whole file : 
[webpack.dev.js.zip](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/files/261186/webpack.dev.js.zip)

finally, use this launch-config : 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

notice the absence of '/dist/' in the webroot. with this config, source-maps are in ./dist/, but they point to ./src/. vscode prepends the absolute root to the workspace, and correctly resolves the file.

also, in the latest version of the debugger, vscode already fixes the webpack:/// urls in the source-maps, so you don't have to.

hope this helps someone.

Not sure that's the right place, but it definitely worked and looks clean to me.

**2. Moving the tsd typings to `src/typings` for more consistency**

Obviously this is not needed, but I found it more intuitive to have a single app-wide `typings` folder. For doing so I added a `tsd.json` ([src here](https://github.com/juristr/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/simple-component/tsd.json)). Maybe we should include this in this starter by default?

This should have been fixed by selecting the correct `BrowserDomAdapter`. Currently this is done in `spec.bundle.js` which will be included in Karma. See https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/spec.bundle.js#L34-L37. I will have a closer look to the problem.

130,2015-11-23 07:58:37,"For me it works in the following way:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

So the trick is not to manually inject HTTP into the `InstrumentFactory`, but provide access to let the Dependency Injector know about the `InstrumentFactory`. The injection of the HTTP service is then done automatically (and implicit) by the Dependency Injector when a new instance of the HTTP service is required.

Why is this better? Think of a large app with hundreds of possible injections. What you want to do is tell the injector what should be used whenever a dependency is requested (e.g. use a mocked version of the HTTP service, etc.). Then whenever the injector resolves a dependency it chooses whatever you have defined. This makes it much easier than resolving the dependencies by hand, which is what you have tried in your approach.

So please give it a try if it does work in this way. I have added [a demo on my fork of this project](https://github.com/dotcs/angular2-webpack-starter/tree/dev_issue-130).

The latter could be replaced with a CDN version, but I prefer to be able to work offline which is why I added also the `bootstrap` dependency.

To make things work, I had to [remove the `/node_modules/` regex](https://github.com/dotcs/angular2-webpack-starter/commit/f6a520138588300f27d6b1042f3d534117c23749#diff-11e9f7f953edc64ba14b0cc350ae7b9dL131) in webpack's typescript module loader definition.

126,2015-11-07 15:20:58,"Hello,

I am expermenting with the starterkit. I was wondering how to use templateURL, is there specific things I need to change or add in the webpack.config.js.

Can you point me in the right direction? In the readme it says  : 

How do I use moduleId with module.id in webpack?
Please use __filename if you must use templateUrl and styleUrls rather than webpack's module system

But it didnt really understand..sorry still pretty new to webpack.

Best regards

126,2015-11-08 18:41:03,"One way to use files for the templates (instead of the inline-style) is to create HTML files and `require` them with the `to-string-loader`.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Webpack will require the file `my-component` and assign the output to the template of the view. Technically you are not using Angular's `templateUrl` here, but in fact it's more or less the same thing. 

On the plus side is that the HTML content is bundled via webpack and does not require an additional HTTP request. You don't have to bother where to put the files on your production environment, because they are bundled. On the negative side is that the bundle will include ALL templates you include in such a way - even if the user may not use all of them. So in very large projects, this might be an issue.

A working example can be found in one of my public repos: [cueonthespot-web](https://github.com/dotcs/cueonthespot-web)

126,2015-11-08 18:48:37,"@dotcs is correct. If we use templateUrl provided by angular then we lose out on some of the optimizations provided by webpack. Thanks for the issue, if you have anymore questions feel free to open another one or comment here

Change [these two lines](https://github.com/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/webpack.config.js#L78..L80) in the webpack config file by removing the comment signs in line 78 and comment out line 80.

I thought that the main idea is to switch examples via webpack config as described in my post above. But reading example's README sounds like the recommended approach is more or less to copy&paste the code ...

We could also use webpack to resolve the examples automatically by adding the examples folder to the resolved variables like it's done [here](https://github.com/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/webpack.config.js#L97) for 'rx'. Then we could always write `import {Home} from 'examples/simple-component/home/home';` regardless of where the file that needs the import is located at.

104,2015-10-21 13:57:31,"I have fixed several issues with angular2@2.0.0-alpha.44. Furthermore I have fixed a broken import (see https://github.com/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter/commit/a49383969f3729a73b1ac067c41e253b95556d53#commitcomment-13901195).

I also changed an import statement to keep the syntax the same across the application, because webpack complained about the import: 

> There is another module with an equal name when case is ignored.
> This can lead to unexpected behavior when compiling on a filesystem with other case-semantic.
> Rename module if multiple modules are expected or use equal casing if one module is expected.

There are still some issues with the 'search github' and 'todo' components, but the router does work again and at least webpack compiles without an error. This PR fixes https://github.com/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/92.

However I am getting lots and lots of errors. Too many to document all of them. I'm wondering if this is a result of where angular2 is up to at the moment of if I have done something wrong.

Just for one many of the examples have the following:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

It appears that this should in fact be:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Also, line 34 in ac_autosuggest.ts throws an error 'zone is unknown.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Is this because the zone module has not been loaded? If so, how do I load it?

99,2015-10-18 19:24:05,"You can fix this particular issue by importing Http and Headers explicitly in bootstrap.ts (it looks like HTTP_PROVIDERS isn't exported by angular2/http any more), and supplying an empty Object to the Headers constructor in app.ts. But then you get another error:

ERROR in ./src/app/app.ts
(100,18): error TS2339: Property 'append' does not exist on type 'Headers'.

You can instantiate Headers with an Object with the header values, which solves this (and webpack can then build the assets):

const JSON_HEADERS = new Headers({
      'Accept': 'application/json',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    });

But then there is an error in the browser console:
NoAnnotationError {message: ""Cannot resolve all parameters for Headers(?). Make sure they all have valid type or annotations."", stack: ""Error: Cannot resolve all parameters for Headers(?…tp://localhost:3000/**build**/angular2.js:9147:14""}

I've gone through the source for the Headers class and it defines a public append method (which is added to Headers.prototype in the compiled js) and can take a {string: any} object in it's constructor, so I'm not sure why Angular is throwing this error.

Before everything else, I thank you very much for providing a starter pack to what seem to me to be the future best angular 2 workflow when the final will be released.
I tried multiple examples and everything seem to work fine, except for the ""large app"" example, which is also the only one featuring a router.
I managed to correct all the errors, but the router is still not functional with the error ""EXCEPTION: No provider for Token RouterPrimaryComponent! (RouterLink -> Router -> Token RouterPrimaryComponent)"".

I also tried to wrap with webpack the angular 2 seed sample from the repo at https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed , but for whatever reason, vars in {{}} aren't interpreted in the about or home templates, as if some sort of $digest wasn't there (even if it doesn't exist anymore in angular 2).

Is there any way to see a working router example with multiple paths using webpack and angular 2 ?
Even a basic plunker would be ok :)

If the dependencies have been installed with node 0.x and later node 4.x is being used to update the packages, this might indeed be a problem that leads to an inconsistent state. The easiest solution here is to delete `node_modules` as mentioned above and re-install dependencies using the latest npm.

80,2015-09-25 07:46:43,"Hi,

I'm not sure if this belongs here, or in angular2 proper, but I noticed that the types that are placed on stuff isn't used at runtime, which can lead to some pretty confusing situations.

Example:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
",asgerjensen,2015-11-06 16:37:05
80,2015-10-04 20:55:24,"this is a browser thing where the type is probably a string so you would need to convert it via `this._value = Number(newValue);`. In TypeScript the types are removed when your code is compiled.
",gdi2290,2015-11-06 16:37:05
80,2015-10-28 19:55:20,"Typescript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain Javascript. In the example above Typescript assumes that `newValue` is a number. Whenever Typescript can check the type, it will do it for you. So Typescript would raise an error if you would try to do something like:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Unfortunately the component template is a string, which is only rendered at runtime. Because of this, Typescript does not now about your `onChange` call. Because Typescript compiles to plain Javascript, there is no way to do the type checking during runtime.

So yes, this is a problem. The only way to handle these kind of problems that I know is to do some additional type checking inside the function and be super careful about the arguments if Typescript can't do the proper checks for you.

To convert to a number you can always do

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The unary plus operator enforces conversion to a number (see [4.14.2 The +, –, and ~ operators](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Content/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.pdf)).

I think a starter pack should provide a way to know if a user is logged in or not. 
Thought the authentication process could just mock the calls to a server. 
There is not an real word application that doesn't need to know if the user can or not do the action.

A clean way to handle login and permissions with the best practice of how to handle such middleware will make it a perfect starter pack. 
Just adding : https://github.com/auth0/angular2-authentication-sample
is not enough since the code is not generic enough.

Previously the `examples/` were merged into the initial app but quickly became too complex for people when starting angular2

62,2015-09-03 10:33:34,"Hi, 
it seems great to separate both.

The middleware problem is not limited to client/server. i ve looked into angular 2, they are some things i actually doesn't see how to handle yet.
More generally how to replace the rootScope behavior. 
Let's say we have an app, some stats are shown, we have a date range or datepicker somewhere. 
eveything is neat and separated so we have a component that show user stats and another his team stats or country stats. 
So differents/separated components, that need to know the user status(has a team or not to show him teams stats menu or no data since you have no team, same for country...)  and the separated datepicker value.
From angular2-authentication-sample they extend the router to know if the user is auth or not. 
But this cannot be applied to all middleware situations. A more simple case is the breadcrumb or menu active problem.
All the examples i've found doesn't show real case like this. 
Maybe it can't be done yet with angular2. 
The only way i see it actually is to use a singleton/localstorage to pass values between components.

49,2015-08-04 20:54:27,"@gdi2290 , with regards to our discussion on gitter, Can you help me establish the following workflow using this project structure?  

Deployment
- Deploy 1 or more bundles to CDN
- Deploy index.html and config.json to server.

Bundles are packaged dependencies:
- Typescript with classes and imports transpiled to ES5, minified and obfuscated.
- LESS with @imports transpiled to CSS and minified
- vendor minified js and css.
- images (png,gif,jpg…) minified.
- fonts and svg

Build conditional resources:
-    if(MOCKS) then load local mock service definitions (using E2E_Mock ) and json mock data files

Server configuration file (config.json)     
- Compile config.json file for target server
  - modify target service urls specific to deployment server.
    - Compile to a tmp folder for access during local testing.
    - copy to dist folder on production build.
  - how to load asynchronously outside of the bundle.

Dev Workflow:
- compile config.json to temp folder
- start webpack-dev-server
- load app in browser
- On change to ts or less files
  - Run lint on source file
  - re-transpile that file and reload into dev-server cache
  - include sourcemaps for debugging

Ready to commit:
- Run karma tests against PhantomJS with code coverage ( Istanbul? 
  - If failure use karma against chrome to debug using webstorm xdebug remote.
- run plato reports with linting for ts and less.
- Package for deployment
- run protractor tests against dist bundles

Package for Deployment:
- Build distribution bundle with cache busting and asset minification
- copy index.html to dist folder
- compile config.json for staging and production.
  - Deployment to server should use the same bundle but specific config.json.

I am currently using ES6, but I want to migrate to Typescript, although that can wait until I have the rest of it working.

I am currently using Angular 1.4.x and need to establish working patterns with this before I migrate to A2.

49,2015-08-10 07:38:01,"During development I often have the UI built before the data services team is ready to serve data.  to facilitate development of the UI I use the Angular-Mocks library, specifically the E2E_Mocks to capture all outgoing http requests and provide canned responses.  This allows me to show a fully functional site using a series of preset json data files served up from canned responses using the mocked service calls.

My understanding with webpack is that you can have an environment variable, read or passed in, that can be used as a build time constant that determines whether or not to include specific blocks, and whether or not to include specified resources in the bundle.

If I wanted to build and test with mocked services I would pass in the MOCK setting (i.e.  USE_MOCKS=true).  This would cause the mockd data json files to be loaded along with the mock service definitions (dynamic mock defs for the expected behavior).

It is simply a conditional compile.

This would also be helpful in a production/dev build to use pre-minified vendor files or not.
",kburson,2015-09-01 04:41:56
49,2015-08-10 07:53:18,"I am struggling with the balance of present functionality vs future.  JSPM with SystemJS seems to me the better system.  SystemJS is a polyfill module system until the browsers catchup with the ES2015 specs, which should be fairly shortly.  This polyfill can be used long term to support legacy browsers but can be dropped in the near future when the evergreen browsers catchup with ES2015.

JSPM is a superior package management system that can roll npm, bower and github all into one system.  Very nice, very organized, self managing.

SystemJS comes with a Bundler, as does JSPM.  The problem I have with the bundler is that, while it can transpile ES6 to ES5 using traceur or babel, it cannot transpile LESS to CSS.

Using LESS files that import a common parent with standard definitions (variables for fonts, colors, sizes and specific mixins) is very helpful.  

It is possible to pre-compile the LESS files and store the compiled version in a build folder, along with a pre-compiled config file defining the application resources for the specific environment. 

During testing the SystemJS can load and transpile all JS resources, but needs to load the pre-transpiled  config.json and app.css (from *.LESS) from a build folder, along with the un-minified versions of  vendor libraries from the JSPM_Components folder hierarchy.

For deployment the SystemJS (or JSPM) can bundle all the necessary resource, selecting the minified versions of vendor libs, as well as pre-compiled versions of all ES6/LESS resources, and any identified fonts and images.

The trick is, how to make this efficient so that you do not have to pre-compile and copy all files to a build folder for testing, then bundles those files for production..

While webpack has a LESS transpiler (loader) available, JSPM (SystemJS) does not.

With Webpack development workflow I can have all the JS/LESS files transpiled on the fly and loaded into an in-memory server (webpack-dev-server) that can hot-swap out individual files as needed during development.  This is a very efficient system.

When testing is complete the same config can be used to bundle these resources into a single JS file ready for deployment thru a CDN, with the config.json and index.html served from the production server (to establish CORS origin).

SystemJS/JSPM does not allow this workflow.  I am still investigating it.

Any thoughts between the two systems ?

I did a completely fresh install (git clone) and the problem disappeared. **A diff between the working and failing installation pointed to some differences in node locations, so I'm going to close the issue, since it is not related to this repo.**  

For the record:
The diff between my failing install and my new fresh install came up with a difference in a config.gypi file. In the working case the 'prefix' variable had the value of ''/usr/local"". In the failing case it was ""/home/anders/.nvm/versions/node/v0.12.7"" (there were other differences in this file as well). If I recall right I followed the instructions in [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-with-nvm-node-version-manager-on-a-vps) between the failing and working installation. The article shows a command that makes the currently active node version (I'm using [node version manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)) global to all users - my hunch is that is that that command fixed my problem.

24,2015-06-22 19:50:36,"Hi,

I just started playing with this starter kit. I ran the sample using the following command to make use of the express-server-example.js file:

node server/express-server-example

It starts the server on the port 8080 and I am able to browse the sample. Then I added the following REST endpoint to the file express-server-example.js:

app.get('/api/sample', function(request, response) {
  response.send({name:""Ravi""});
});

Now when I hit this endpoint, I get the following view instead of getting JSON response from the endpoint:

I tried to fix this and ended with no luck as of now. Is this a bug in the starter kit? Otherwise, can someone help me in resolving this?

24,2015-07-05 04:43:43,"@gdi2290 Thanks Patrick. I tried it and it worked well. I have just one more question, how to run the express server along with the build and watch processes? I tried it with the following script in NPM, but it stops at express and doesn't run watch:

""myServer"": ""npm install && npm run build && npm run express && npm run watch""

Is there a way to run both of them together?
",sravikiran,2015-07-04 21:07:27
24,2015-07-05 05:08:13,"@sravikiran the stub is rebuilding in development but you have to reload manually [express-server-example.js#L97](https://github.com/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/server/express-server-example.js#L97) until I correctly inject the webpack socketio stuff. I would delete the build folder and run `npm run express` then reload the browser manually when you make a change for now. You don't need to use `npm run build` or `npm run watch` with the express stub since the files are built in-memory

I noticed Webpack-seed works with versions angular2@2.0.0-alpha.13 through 18, but fails at 19+.
