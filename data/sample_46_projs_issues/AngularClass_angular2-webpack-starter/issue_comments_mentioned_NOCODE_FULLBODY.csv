`angular-cli` creates this file at webpack runtime, but in the same time has a lot of other ""enforcements"", like having to use it's internal TS loader and other stuff.

There is no issue with this file in the project since it is not an entry point when not in AOT mode hence it's there but not used.

When this file is used, it is in AOT mode which means that the AOT compiler just finished running so the file is referencing an existing file.

The error people get is because the `awesome-typescript-loader` type checker does not care about the entry point, it parses the whole library so people get errors but they are virtual.

I mean that the way you use it is not the way it is intended to be used.

`tsc` is a command line tool based on a static JSON file, if you want multiple configurations you need multiple files.

This repository is based on webpack, not `tsc`, we use webpack tools to dynamically control the tool chain. We don't exclude `main.browser.aot.ts` in our **tsconfig** because we relay on webpack **entryPoint** for that.

You are trying to use one of the tools in the toolchain without providing the proper environment to it, which we do using webpack.

Thanks for your fast answer and your good job.
Problem was with NgcWebpackPlugin in default webpack.common.js:

After removing 'resourceOverride' dynamic creating work good with AOT compiling even with JitCompilerFactory.

As we understood this option do not remove from components source of HTML templates and JIT compiler can read and compile these templates.

So repeat. How is actually it works:
1. If components was compiled by AOT.
2. Some dynamic component wants to use one or more AOT components.
3. Shall JIT compiler recompile all component (templates, styles) used by dynamic component?
It means that we shall save all source html and styles after AOT compilation for JIT compiler.
Also we shall include JIT compiler to our project.
As result we will have: additional size of JIT compiler + all sources of components.

The problem is that it does not play nicely with relative imports.
It requires you to add **ALL** virtual SCSS files into the resource array in the webpack plugin configuration which is something that adds a lot of noise to the starter.  
I can live with that... but most devs won't know about it so they will just add `@imports` to the `_variable` file... we'll end up supporting sass resource loader.

@d3viant0ne Can you provide any insight into this issue?",jgornick,DanielYKPan
1379,2017-01-23 15:27:19,"@DanielYKPan I've found a solution that worked for me:



That configuration will run any required HTML files through the `html-loader` (see `angular2-template-loader`). The `html-loader` requires any paths specified in `img:src` (i.e. images). Because the images are now being required into the dependency graph, we use the `file-loader` for any required `jpg|png|gif` images and write their path to `/assets/img/[name].[ext]`. Now the URLs in the HTML templates have the correct path to the image assets specified in `img:src` (e.g. `{output.publicPath}/assets/img/[name].[ext]`). 

This also plays nicely with the `CopyWebpackPlugin` found in the `webpack.common.js` configuration.

@d3viant0ne Is it worth submitting a pull request to run the HTML templates through the `html-loader`?",jgornick,DanielYKPan

Also, the final tsconfig is not known to the user, very blurry...

",shlomiassaf,colinskow
1378,2017-02-07 22:43:53,"@shlomiassaf 

There are two ways TypeScript can work with lazy loaded modules:
1) Compile every single file in the project
2) Compile entry files, plus declared lazy loaded modules

If you want to avoid compiling everything, then there is no way around declaring lazy loaded modules. Remember when we used to have to declare vendor libraries?

The way around this would be to write a script that parses the dependency tree and detects lazy loaded modules on its own. But that's a lot of work for very little productivity gain in my eyes.",colinskow,shlomiassaf

Although `ng-router-loader` kicks in after `awesome-typescript-loader` finished TS to JS conversion it still adds a reference to a file (which is TS).
Webpack will load this file and send it through TS loader chain.

So anyway, the files goes through TS compilation hence TS type checking.

Just a couple small points:
1) Add a `clean:dll` NPM script, and also add the `dll` folder to the `clean` script.
2) You should think about unit testing the logic of your package (outside the Webpack build)

The bottom line is that DLLs make dev builds run a lot faster, once the DLLs are built. This is a good merge as long as it doesn't have unexpected side effects or break existing builds that otherwise work.",colinskow,shlomiassaf

The config file for the DLL has nothing to it, it's based on the common... so, IMO, no need to have another config file.

1. I think electron.main should be on a dedicated folder in root. This is because you potentially want to extend electron main capabilities and have multiple files for it.

2. I don't think NGRX fits this starter. That is why I created an advanced starter. NGRX is just too complex for most devs starting with angular2.

Would you be willing to implement your electron improvements in my [advanced starter](https://github.com/JonnyBGod/angular2-webpack-advance-starter)?",JonnyBGod,colinskow
1352,2017-01-26 23:30:57,"@JonnyBGod thank you for the feedback.

1. I created a separate `electron` folder inside `src` to place sub-modules for the main process. It felt awkward having them outside of the `src` tree. Ideally I would use a different folder structure, but I want to keep everything the same so I can easily pull updates from this repo.

2. Most devs who are just starting with Angular2 should be using Angular-CLI. This repo is really for those of us who aren't satisfied with CLI and are obsessed with customizing the build. Redux/ngrx is the absolute best way to manage state and scaling without it is a headache. I included a very simple implementation (one reducer, one action). It wanted to show how to hook it up to HMR, unit tests, and the Redux DevTools extension since that is tricky.

I just setup several DevTools extensions which will automatically install themselves in development mode.

Feel free to pull what you want from my code. I'm using specialized Electron code, so my fork no longer supports browser builds.",colinskow,JonnyBGod

1347,2017-01-07 06:17:04,"@shlomiassaf just to be clear the case for the DLLs pull request is that it cuts dev build time in half, which leads to dramatic productivity gains -- especially when repeatedly testing small changes in code or debugging. It's a money maker for the companies who will use this starter.

The DLLs are setup so they are totally transparent to the user, who gets automatic immediate productivity gains as soon as we test and merge the PR.

Seems like it is related to this issue: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/2145

They suggest changing `devtool` (in `config/webpack.dev.js`) to `eval-source-map`. It may be slightly slower, but breakpoints should work. (You should also experiment with different devtools to see what works and gives you optimum build time.)

The other options is to create a separate `tsconfig.webpack.dev.json` with `commonjs` module type for dev builds, since tree shaking doesn't make any difference here.

1321,2017-01-21 03:47:27,"@d3viant0ne The problem described by @pglazkov @pleerock fit's an issue that might happen with the older implementation (non AST).

The old process used regex with replace to transform the code.
On a module, if multiple lazy routes were set the old process had to take each and replace it.
Before replacing we need to resolve the actual file, this is an async process.
So since each ""replace"" is **async** I had to store the whole module code in memory and each replace that returned did the actual replace on that in memory ""source"".

The problem described above shows that some lazy paths were not replaced, which might indicate some race condition but I couldn't reproduce it, I tried 2000 lazy modules, no luck.

What's more confusing is that **async** is not a parallel, every instruction runs alone in the vm so I don't really understand what happened there.

My best guess is that it happens on win machines.

Anyways, I decided to refactor and use AST which is more accurate. I also made sure all changes happens sync.

1304,2016-12-28 23:41:56,"@colinskow I used a different take on this.

I used a convention to identify global SCSS files: `some-style.global.scss`

Then a loader:


> The component SCSS loader must also `exclude: [/\.global\.scss$/],`

Now all `*.global.scss` files are set in the head.

This is of course not a separate file for styles but it differentiates between global and component local styles.


Now, for having styles in a separate file, this is something I think the developer should decide.

I think we should put the extract plugin to target 1 file, all other files the dev wants to include he should import from that main (and not from JS code).

If he imports from JS code it goes to the head.

**My reasoning about this is that if all styles are in 1 directory it's far more logical to import them all from one file inside that directory, similar to an `index`file in a package/module/barrel.**

I see this directory as the `theme` for the app, plus it's more aligned with SASS `@import`s...

I have a problem with style imports scattered around the project, it's hard tracking their order and that's important for CSS.",shlomiassaf,colinskow

1304,2017-01-04 01:16:53,"1.) Rebase it.

2.) As far as conventions go, they are much like words in scrabble. `Common Use`

In this case, I think it would be best to not enforce conventions on people. If a developer wants to do something like @shlomiassaf is suggesting, they can extend the project as they see fit.

The most common way I have seen / used in regards to scss and 3rd party styles would be to use `@import` in something like `main.scss / styles.scss` at the root of a project or styles directory.

Keep it simple & let the developer make his / her own decisions on conventions.",d3viant0ne,shlomiassaf

For the e2e tests, you need to run some sort of server for Protractor to execute against. In a CI environment, that requires additional commands prior to the execution of the e2e tests.

The same is applicable for running the test watcher during active development, where you normally don't want to be running an e2e suite which can involve other services to be running in most data driven applications.

The validations are split intentionally which is both the community standard way to handle testing and the most flexible as well as, imo having the best overall development experience.

As I forked `angular2-webpack-starter` before [that commit](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/commit/306672798cf5865037ccba37ac7aa4feb89c2110#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2) of 23-Nov, it was `^2.2.1` just for the `@angular/forms`.

So my full fix was:

1. Modified `package.json` to set:

- `""typescript"": ""2.1.1""` (use to be `^2.0.6`, which brought me `v2.1.4`)
- `""@angular/forms"": ""2.2.1""` (use to be `^2.2.1`, which brought me `v2.3.0`, when other `@angular/` were `2.2.1`). As an alternative, you can make them all `^2.2.1` and it will work again as all `@angular/` versions will be aligned.

2. Deleted corresponding folders in `node_modules` and ran `npm install`. For some reason, running `npm install` straight away didn't work (something was cached?).

Point being, this is one of those things that is really dependent on exactly what you are trying to achieve and how you are setup. Any way it goes, you will need `WebpackMd5Hash` as @karolmie1  mentioned.

It's also worth noting that what I run in production isn't based off the starter, so just grabbing that snippet isn't going to work ( just an example ).

I highly suggest reading https://webpack.js.org/guides/caching/ more than once and then start hacking on your project. Caching is one of those things you can get ""kind of right"" and end up with weird results.

1169,2017-02-22 20:30:35,"@JimTheMan yes hmr (Hot Module Replacement) reloads your components and styles without a full page reload. It also has some hooks so you can reload the state of the application before hmr was triggered.

Basically, you write your own logic ([example](https://gist.github.com/cmckni3/332627bc8b39d58c3014fda72d6f1c35#file-app-module-ts-L45), [example](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/src/app/app.module.ts#L83)) to save your application's state and restore the application's state using the hmr lifecycle methods.",cmckni3,JimTheMan

Update: I used the good old ""copy and paste"" development and forced the snippets from @cmckni3's examples into my app.module.ts file, and it seems to be working. God, this is amazing... haha. 

Although, it seems like a small percentage of the time will randomly reload after I make changes instead of hotly replacing things. Do you guys ever notice this?",JimTheMan,cmckni3

2) webpack.common.js

3) Add loaders for sass under (npm i --save-dev sass-loader) and all UNMEET DEPENDENCIES



4) vendor.ts



Frequently errors:
- resolve-url-loader, 'path' of undefined

You need to add next rows to LoaderOptionPlugin

That being said, would you be interested in open sourcing the your personal repo that has ngrx and scss. I would be more than interested in maintaining. Regardless, I am going to go ahead and create a ngrx/scss version of this repo. Thank you.

@katallaxie I'll try to explain myself with a use case: If someone want to add another set of linting rules from other source, says `tslint-eslint-rules`, those rules would be grouped in a external file, ex: `eslint.tslint.json`, in the `config/tslint/` foler, and just extends those set of rules.

My suggestion would be to go the route that @NathanWalker with https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular-seed-advanced

Fork the starter, make your additions & squash them into a single commit to make it easier to pick up changes from upstream and once it's in good shape, I'm sure @gdi2290 wouldn't have an issue with adding a link to the README.md to make it easier to find your version of the `advanced starter`

If this were my issue, I would probably use ts-md5 as a starting point if portions of it are viable, include it in a shared module ( faster for developing ) and stick a comment at the top referencing the original repo. Once it's current & in good working order, PR it back to the original repo or publish a new package if the owner doesn't respond.

1004,2016-09-19 12:40:28,"Hi @randyangeles,

If you are trying to setup routes you need to provide the routes in your import and unless I am mistaken importing RouterTestingModule takes care of mocking Router for you.  You would need to do something like the following:



You can then create routes to actual or mock components within your test.  In my case the routing is really simple (I really only use routing to make it easy to get info from the URL and for future support) so I actually removed the routing and only include the core import at the moment.

Take a look at the documentation (which unfortunately still appears to be a work in progress) for more information (https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/router/testing/index/RouterTestingModule-class.html).

Hope this helps!

This issue is caused by webpack being unhappy with dynamic imports. The Webpack team states that this is by design:

Are the dynamic `System.import` calls (as called out above on lines 45 and 57) absolutely necessary? Having to shut off a highly recommended piece of webpack feels hacky.

(2) That is automatically transform Component Metadata to `require`statements, to Hot Module Reloading, and have async components. So, a lot of stuff that is hard to have in the CLI as you have to have a lot of boilerplate code.

We have the courses on a new schedule that is not reflected on the website and the order might change up a bit. This is mostly due to fit Angular 2's release which is very soon and due to the recent changes in `2.0.0-rc.5`. We thought it would be better if we recreate the courses using the new approach after Angular 2 is released. The delay of the reactive course is mostly my fault going back and forth with @Hendrixer on if we should teach our new reactive architecture that we have, or to use the [angular2-observe-decorators](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-observe-decorators), or to focus only on reactivity and state management (our original plan). We were also thinking about if we should teach more RxJS or move that into the Modern JavaScript course or provide that as a mini-course. We decided to stick with our original plan because the observe-decorators is teaching a new way to manage your app with my own proposed spec that might change if it's merged with the Angular codebase. Our new reactive architecture has all of the features that everyone is talking about (rxjs, redux, sagas, effects) plus a ton of features that no-one is talking about (past/present/future states, interop, priority rendering, isolated loops, hot module replacement, webworkers, universal) and would need a few more iterations to unify the whole story.

Turns out that `angular2-template-loader` cannot understand line comments inside of the routes object. During testing, I had a lot of variations commented out on one of my sub module routes, like this:



But that gives many errors. Just by removing the line comments, it fixed it:



That was tricky to diagnose.

The second part of my fix was that on my typescript loader, I was using `'angular2-router-loader'`, but it never worked as expected. Then, I saw in your repo that you have `'angular2-router-loader?loader=system'`, so I tried it, and that did the trick!

So lessons: 
- add query `?loader=system` to `angular2-router-loader`
- don't use any line comments within routes object for sub modules loaded by `angular2-router-loader`

Small implementation details aside, the only really viable way to get AoT working in a meaningful way would be the route @qdouble took. Kind of wish I would have seen his starter prior to doing all that work myself :/ as we ended up in a similar place.

_**If the intent is to get AoT into this starter sooner rather than later,  qdouble/angular-webpack2-starter would be the path forward.**_ 

That said, there are some pretty significant challenges with AoT once you grow your application to anything of production size. `AoT is a commitment to building in a specific way`, most of which won't be apparent with the small starter application. For instance, anyone using Sass in the normal fashion of using require statements in components for styles are going to have a lot of work to do. 

If we are going to land AoT now, everyone should be ready for the onslaught of questions and issues when people try to pull in AoT enabled #master and their builds explode ( been there ... lol ). 

Also worth noting, if we are going to release AoT support we definitely need to test the AoT builds for PRs or we are going to be breaking master every other day ( been there too ).

As soon as all the issues I knew about were resolved, I [tried](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/885#issuecomment-267594608) getting a status update on it, didn't get any answer and instead this issue, which was the only [issue V6 was discussed at](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/885#issuecomment-255840442), as far as I know anyway, was closed, which was what prompted my last comment, asking for whether there was, or was going to be another issue created for the V6 branch. I didn't get any reply, which is why I wrote [this](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/1330#issuecomment-270340310).

So how about you cut me a slack, I didn't mean anything offensive in the slightest sense, I'm all up for helping finish that branch but without ever getting an answer about your plans going forward, it's kind of hard.


..and yes, what is currently on master is indeed obsolete, especially at the time I wrote that comment, compared to your V6 branch. At DLLs and the way and the language configs are written in, for example.

I honestly couldn't care less, as I had to move to qdouble's starter couple of months ago because I simply couldn't proceed without AOT, but it seems like a wasted chance, time and effort to abandon that branch, unless there are reasons for it, which is what I kept asking for.",fxck,shlomiassaf

Actually, `easy-webpack` doesn't need to be used in combination with the ""magical"", external config packages that you cite above: all the configs can be inlined, it can be used as a more advanced `webpack-merge`, which as I see, you already use.

Near as I can tell, the issue went away when I switched to using root-relative background-image url(...)... with some mixup I attributed this to using the file-loader, but so far, it seems that even if I delete these loaders it works, as long as I'm using root-relative URLs.

This relates to css-loader's [root relative URLs feature](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader#root-relative-urls). 

The original issue, then, is still unsolved.

A quick workaround, I guess, is to just use root-relative urls, such as: `background-image url(/assets/img/myimg.jpeg)`

After disabling my components one by one, I found out that this particular import causes the error:
`import {Subscription} from ""rxjs/Rx"";`
Commenting this import resolves the issue. I wanted to do something like `this.subscription.unsubscribe()` on a component's `ngOnDestroy` where `this.subscription`'s type is set to 'Subscription' imported from `rxjs/Rx`.

Strange that this causes Webpack to compile into ES6 though. Worth looking into?

Update: I'm using WebStorm 2016.1 and `rxjs/Rx` is the only file WebStorm recommends me to import `Subscription` from.

But if you really need to use async code that located outside of angular app, you need to wrap it with [NgZone.run(yourCode)](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/NgZone-class.html#!#run-anchor) or finalize it with [ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/ChangeDetectorRef-class.html#!#detectChanges-anchor)

Webpack config has `devtool: 'cheap-module-source-map'`.

A fix for us was to include either of the following as a Webpack plugin:
- `new webpack.ContextReplacementPlugin(/moment[\/\\]locale$/, /en-us/)`
- `new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/^\.\/locale/, /moment$/)` 

Note that the first solution works but is broken, since there's no `en-us` files in `moment/locale` for v2.13.0 - I just got it via copy-pasta from another project. The second solution should be preferred.

645,2016-06-08 00:52:40,"@valorkin The implementation does use the `gh-pages` package but it wont work out of the box, it need some help getting it to actually work.

The main reason is that in github the base url is always **username**.github.io/**repo-name**. In most cases the application will not have a **repo-name** prefix, it's usually the root of the domain.

So, we have 3 different setups:  
-  Local dev server
-  Deployment in production
-  Deployment in github.

This is why we need an additional config since it a different setup.

We also need to think about the purpose of `angular2-webpack-starter`, it's a set tools aimed to making the developers life easier, not having to manually manage work flows.
Having to run `gh-pages -d dist` manually requires some previous steps, you have to run the build and if you forgot you probably just posted an older version to github, this is a common mistake that happened to me more then once :)
It get's even worse if you forgot to edit your **index.html** to support the github pages base url prefix, again happened to me more then once.
This is actually why I created this flow, then realized it can be integrated into this project.

Another thing is that you can deploy 2 (or more, custom) compilation artefacts to github, minified production build or a development build.

Also, this PR tries to keep it simple so you don't have a lot of configuration options to control the `gh-pages` package, this can be done in a later phase. I prefer a simple PR first so we can understand it.

So using the `gh-pages -d dist` approach you need to do some manual work, which is the same for every release: build and edit `index.html`, this is a prefect scenario for automation.

If you investigate the config file you will see it's basically a simple webpack plugin, I think we should first adopt the PR and then opt for a plugin after we get around most use cases and options to support.

Having to prefix every resource with `<%= webpackConfig.output.publicPath %>`:



Add's a lot of noise that I really don't like, and it's ""sort of"" an API change, this is why I asked @gdi2290 to ask for community help.

BTW, if a user has a public path different then `/` this is something that he needs to do anyway, hardcoding the public path is a recipe for future errors since it can't be refactored automatically.

The solution here is probably defining a static asset array with objects for every  static asset and building them when we compile index.html, something like:



This allows supporting every attribute out there.
It also doesn't break anything, if someone doesn't want github deployment support he can just hardcode his assets.

All in all, I think it's better to define static assets outside of `index.html` and keep it as clean as possible.
",shlomiassaf,gdi2290
645,2016-06-10 02:35:07,"@gdi2290 before I start, some consult.

Since a static asset file has volume I don't think it should be within the configurations themselves.

We can put it in a file, in the config directory... something like
`assets.common.json` or `assets.dev.json` etc... 

In the configs we can opt in for them if the file exists and create the html, this result's in a non breaking API modification.

Another option is to let the user set the json asset file (path) in the config's.

I like the first option better, it's convention over configuration which is less confusion.

1- Remove the --bail flag => it doesn't solve anything but the error stack was much more meaningful when it's gone.
2- In my Heroku build, I forgot to install the typings on Heroku. Check whether you have not forgotten to do that either.

Regarding Typings, I had also another problem, in the newest version (typings > 1), it looks now different. Finally my current (successful) typings file looks like that

Thanks for reply. I was having typings already installed on my machine.
here are my observations:
1) `--bail` removal is basically allowing build to proceed to show actual errors which I fixed.
2) Although I have following version of node - v6.2.0 and npm- v3.8.9 this should not be an issue
3) you can remove dev and ambient dependencies sections from typings.ts  as these has been replaced with `""globalDependencies""`

I doesn't know anything that systemjs can do, that webpack 2 doesn't.

In my very personal opinion recompile each time with webpack during development time is clearly overkill. You should at least have the chance of using both and be able to switch without problems, but at first instance they are incompatible. Webpack sould be used for production.

@messerbill It seems the latest version of typescript enable to include external libraries easier not forcing you to declare types so strictly but then you have to manage the way of load them as webpack plugins.  Also my version of webstorm throws errors with the latest typescript. Im trapped lol.

Typescript and Web components are good idea but so many moving parts and so much bloated code.... For example, using angular-cli you end having aaaaall testing frameworks duplicated as angular dependencies and angular-cli dependencies (jasmine, protractor, karma, selenium webdriver). May be npm is the culprit. It is needed more stability and clear guides. Supposedly Angular 2 have been ended beta phase and have been released as stable version.

Since when I merge with git if the name/location is not the same it's not as smooth. Also maybe using a webpack.common that's in common with both repo might be helpful, and using helper.js in both to calculate the root in webpack. In the end I would aim for as little difference between the two repos as necessary. However, all of this is just little things. Wouldn't want to add extra work for just my own preference.

Facing the same issue and it is intermittent.
With the earlier releases (till Angular 2 Beta 9) it was working fine and we are using Bootstrap, jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery Datepicker, Timepicker and Date range picker without any issues.

When we update to recent commits (with Beta 11) we are facing the same issue as mentioned by @ryneflood 

We tried this
- Running `npm run server:dev`
- Disabled entire jQuery and all it's plugins : Working fine.
- When we move to pages where jQuery used : it is giving error like jQuery not found
- Enabled jQuery using ProvidePlugin in Webpack config and re-run `npm run server:dev` : jQuery found.
- When we move to pages where jQuery UI Datepicker is used : jQuery(...).datepicker(....) not found
- Imported jQuery UI along with other plugins in `main.browser.ts`
- Browser refreshed and all are working fine.
- Stopped `npm run server:dev`
- Re-run `npm run server:dev`
- Getting `Cannot read property 'call' of undefined` error. Which was working fine previously

Tried to debug the error and found Webpack moduleId (170 in our case) not found and modules[moduleId] returning undefined.

Tried developer tool's Error call stack : it is showing error in the first line of `main.browser.ts`

Any suggestions on debugging this issue would be great.

but, its not that easy to fix it, because if you check the current [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/tsconfig.json#L10) node_modules are excluded, even if you add `./node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js.d.ts` to `filesGlob` it won't gain any precedence over the node_modules exclusion. If you remove the node_modules exclusion you will get a bunch of duplicate identifier errors

Nevertheless `./src/custom-typings.d.ts` is not a wise decision: 
- what if in the future you will have to define several dozen of libs? 
- what if you want to define them good not just to shut the compiler up? that single file will grow very big
- what if you want to temporary load `./node_modules/zone.js/dist/zone.js.d.ts`?

I think it would be wiser to create `./manual-typings/` and place all the custom `.d.ts` file there and load this folder. This is where i added the missing `zone.js.d.ts` file. So, [something like this.](https://github.com/tsm91/ng2-starter-kit/commit/5c781dab938d53fff0d18376e582e639a026394e)

The terminology does trigger some interesting conversations.  

As you say it's a unit test but not of a service, I'm testing a unit of behaviour within my UI (port level testing).

Protractor is my mechanism for accessing the closed system to test a behaviour, and since Protractor is always labelled as an end to end testing tool, I mistakenly used the term.  

Either way, I'm after a Protractor, not Karma solution to this problem :o)

Regarding the reference to 'E2E', these aren't end to end tests but unit tests of the behaviour of the front end as a closed component.  I've seen it called 'port level testing', 'sociable unit tests' and 'behavioural unit testing'.  

Ultimately I need to mock any requests that move across the boundary of my component, in this case calls the the API.

If you're unfamiliar and are interested in the idea, the approach was triggered from a talk by Ian Cooper I saw a couple of years ago.  I didn't see this one at NDC 2013 but it's the same presentation I believe.

382,2017-01-13 08:39:56,"@d3viant0ne 

I know that AOT itself changes only the compiled output, but I thought that to make AOT working someone had to write a shiny new webpack loader or something that could maybe somehow affect the situation. 

I have never seen before those ""[at-loader]"" warnings and errors. Our last ""full sync"" with angular2-webpack-starter was back in 9.9.2016, so probably quite a few things have changed after that.

Ps. I did try to add following paths also to tsconfig.json and tsconfig.webpack.json, but did not work:

",rvalimaki,d3viant0ne
382,2017-01-13 14:04:51,"@rvalimaki 
  
  - If it happens in dev mode AOT has nothing to do with it.
  - If you are aliasing packages that are in DLLs (even though it makes no sense) make sure to include it in the DLL webpack config

I assume it's none of the abode...

Aliasing is a simple feature in webpack, it get's complex when you have 2 or more processes that requires context. The more process the more things to do... 

Webpack in dev + TS = 2 processes
Webpack in prod + AOT + TS = 3 processes!

The alias in webpack gives context for resolving modules within webpack, it will not pass those aliases to TypeScript since it runs on a different context.

You need to explicitly set these paths for TypeScript.

Setting it in the `paths` in `tsconfig` is only good for AOT compilation using the angular compiler... since webpack isn't involved for TS module resolution.

You also need to set it in Webpack via a plugin, telling the TS loader to apply the paths.

Usually this simple setup will do:


Just put it in common, make sure the paths in the tsconfig file are correct.
You can pretty much apply all types of aliasing, I did crazy stuff...

The reason you need a plugin is for the loader to be able to map files between  Webpack and TS.
You can also send a custom configuration to the plugin, see the awesome loader site.",shlomiassaf,rvalimaki

Well I'm trying to figure it out for days and still got nothing.

Does anyone have any idea?",rochapablo,shlomiassaf
382,2017-01-17 14:13:30,"@rochapablo 

So you have already this:
`const TsConfigPathsPlugin = require('awesome-typescript-loader').TsConfigPathsPlugin;`

...and that (in ""plugins""):
`new TsConfigPathsPlugin(),`

... in webpack.common.js?

Not really sure, but I do not have trailing backslashes on alias configuration, so I do use `helpers.root('src/app')` instead of `'src/app/'`

Did you remember to set tsconfig paths to both tsconfig.json and tsconfig.webpack.json?

Also I do set the ""baseUrl"" in tsconfig, though maybe it doesn't affect the situation you have:
`    ""baseUrl"": ""./src"",
    ""paths"": {
      ""app/*"": [
        ""app/*""

That main SCSS file is referenced in the main/top-level `AppComponent`. It can then import other SCSS files like `_common.scss`. Even though viewEncapsulation is turned off for the primary component I can still require SCSS files for specific components and it works fine.

Try using the following for the loaders in your `webpack.config.js`:
`loaders: ['raw-loader', 'sass-loader']`

See what I have and maybe it will help:

Yes, Atom and Sublime and other tooling also understands this also. But you have to exclude everything that's not meant to be included and I can tell you that's a pain sometimes and I wouldn't recommend it as the default. At a minimum, you'll have to start with `node_modules`. Also, you can't use `files` with `exclude`, which means the second some file inside of an excludes needs to be included (E.g. a module provides you an ambient declaration, such as `reflect-metadata`) you can no longer use `exclude` properly.

@valorkin I had already installed `moment` via tsd.

What I had to do was the following.

**1. Reference the `tsd.d.ts` generated by `tsd` in `src/typings/_custom.d.ts`.**



Not sure that's the right place, but it definitely worked and looks clean to me.

**2. Moving the tsd typings to `src/typings` for more consistency**

Obviously this is not needed, but I found it more intuitive to have a single app-wide `typings` folder. For doing so I added a `tsd.json` ([src here](https://github.com/juristr/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/simple-component/tsd.json)). Maybe we should include this in this starter by default? What's your view on this @gdi2290 ? or does it interfere with your plans from issue #122 ?

If the idea is to copy&paste the code to the `src` folder, @zarkosusnjar's PR should be accepted (and we should check all other imports in the examples, too). I thought that the main idea is to switch examples via webpack config as described in my post above. But reading example's README sounds like the recommended approach is more or less to copy&paste the code ...

We could also use webpack to resolve the examples automatically by adding the examples folder to the resolved variables like it's done [here](https://github.com/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/webpack.config.js#L97) for 'rx'. Then we could always write `import {Home} from 'examples/simple-component/home/home';` regardless of where the file that needs the import is located at.

https://github.com/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/37#issuecomment-124897281
Will probably work. I'll try tonight or tomorrow sometime.
",NathanWalker,gdi2290
34,2015-07-26 16:36:46,"Ok @gdi2290 That indeed did fix it so I updated the `package.json` to include that `NODE_ENV=development` when running the sample backend api server, as well as updated the README with a line on how to run it.

33,2015-07-20 03:15:03,"@andersbc What happens when you use an older loader version like `npm i typescript-simple-loader@0.3.0`? The only possible commit that (I think) can be causing issues is https://github.com/blakeembrey/typescript-simple-loader/commit/db5a44edb92e7e0b3f80f50c83a1dc315267c3cc
",blakeembrey,andersbc
33,2015-07-20 11:47:09,"@blakeembrey. thanks, it wasn't that though (it didn't change anything). I think the problem comes from some npm-related fault on my part when I installed the repo. I did a completely fresh install (git clone) and the problem disappeared. **A diff between the working and failing installation pointed to some differences in node locations, so I'm going to close the issue, since it is not related to this repo.**  

For the record:
The diff between my failing install and my new fresh install came up with a difference in a config.gypi file. In the working case the 'prefix' variable had the value of ''/usr/local"". In the failing case it was ""/home/anders/.nvm/versions/node/v0.12.7"" (there were other differences in this file as well). If I recall right I followed the instructions in [this article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-with-nvm-node-version-manager-on-a-vps) between the failing and working installation. The article shows a command that makes the currently active node version (I'm using [node version manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)) global to all users - my hunch is that is that that command fixed my problem. 
",andersbc,blakeembrey
33,2015-07-20 11:51:43,"@andersbc Glad you sorted it! I use `n` personally but it's the same idea. If you're working with any projects that have binaries you'll need to reinstall them when you switch versions. I usually just `rm -rf node_modules && npm i`. 
",blakeembrey,andersbc
29,2015-07-16 16:20:19,"@gdi2290 If you need any help just ping me any time. Also if you have ideas for more (useful) RxJs showcases please let me know. I'd be happy to implement them.

24,2015-07-05 04:43:43,"@gdi2290 Thanks Patrick. I tried it and it worked well. I have just one more question, how to run the express server along with the build and watch processes? I tried it with the following script in NPM, but it stops at express and doesn't run watch:

""myServer"": ""npm install && npm run build && npm run express && npm run watch""

Is there a way to run both of them together?
",sravikiran,gdi2290
24,2015-07-05 05:08:13,"@sravikiran the stub is rebuilding in development but you have to reload manually [express-server-example.js#L97](https://github.com/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/server/express-server-example.js#L97) until I correctly inject the webpack socketio stuff. I would delete the build folder and run `npm run express` then reload the browser manually when you make a change for now. You don't need to use `npm run build` or `npm run watch` with the express stub since the files are built in-memory

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

I am using a older version of angular2-webpack. I cant tell wich Version... Because in this version i downloadet is no where a version number in the readme file... But it must be about 1 year old.

# Here the Readme File:

# angular2-webpack

[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/preboot/angular2-webpack/status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/preboot/angular2-webpack#info=dependencies) [![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/preboot/angular2-webpack/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/preboot/angular2-webpack#info=devDependencies)

**Note: This guide is following the Angular's [Style Guide](http://angular.io/styleguide) so I will be changing conventions here and there eventually. You are free to use your own conventions with this starter.**
**Note 2: There is no conventions yet for RC5 on the style guide so there will be a future update here for that.**

A complete, yet simple, starter for Angular 2 using Webpack.

This seed repo serves as an Angular 2 starter for anyone looking to get up and running with Angular 2 and TypeScript fast. Using [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) for building our files and assisting with boilerplate. We're also using Protractor for our end-to-end story and Karma for our unit tests.
* Best practices in file and application organization for [Angular 2](https://angular.io/).
* Ready to go build system using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/docs/) for working with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).
* Testing Angular 2 code with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/).
* Coverage with [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)
* End-to-end Angular 2 code using [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/).
* Stylesheets with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (not required, it supports regular css too).
* Error reported with [TSLint](http://palantir.github.io/tslint/) and [Codelyzer](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer).
* Documentation with [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.io/).

>Warning: Make sure you're using the latest version of Node.js and NPM

[Is Angular 2 Ready Yet?](http://splintercode.github.io/is-angular-2-ready/)

### Quick start

> Clone/Download the repo then edit `app.ts` inside [`/src/app/app.component.ts`](/src/app/app.component.ts)


go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

# Getting Started

## Dependencies

What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (Use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* Ensure you're running Node (`v5.x.x`+) and NPM (`3.x.x`+)

## Installing

* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Developing

After you have installed all dependencies you can now start developing with:

* `npm start`

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The application can be checked at `http://localhost:8080`.

As an alternative, you can work using Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

* `npm run start:hmr`

And you are all set! You can now modify your components on the fly without having to reload the entire page.

## Testing

#### 1. Unit Tests

* single run: `npm test`
* live mode (TDD style): `npm run test-watch`

#### 2. End-to-End Tests (aka. e2e, integration)

* single run:
  * in a tab, *if not already running!*: `npm start`
  * in a new tab: `npm run webdriver-start`
  * in another new tab: `npm run e2e`
* interactive mode:
  * instead of the last command above, you can run: `npm run e2e-live`
  * when debugging or first writing test suites, you may find it helpful to try out Protractor commands without starting up the entire test suite. You can do this with the element explorer.
  * you can learn more about [Protractor Interactive Mode here](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#testing-out-protractor-interactively)

## Production

To build your application, run:

* `npm run build`

You can now go to `/dist` and deploy that to your server!

## Documentation

You can generate api docs (using [TypeDoc](http://typedoc.io/)) for your code with the following:

* `npm run docs`

# FAQ

#### Do I need to add script / link tags into index.html ?

No, Webpack will add all the needed Javascript bundles as script tags and all the CSS files as link tags. The advantage is that you don't need to modify the index.html every time you build your solution to update the hashes.

#### How to include external angular 2 libraries ?

It's simple, just install the lib via npm and import it in your code when you need it. Don't forget that you need to configure some external libs in the [bootstrap](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack/blob/master/src/main.ts) of your application.

#### How to include external css files such as bootstrap.css ?

Just install the lib and import the css files in [vendor.ts](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack/blob/master/src/vendor.ts). For example this is how to do it with bootstrap:



And in [vendor.ts](https://github.com/preboot/angular2-webpack/blob/master/src/vendor.ts) add the following:



# TypeScript

> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor

We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 11+](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)

Managed to fix my issue by including 
$icon-font-path: '~bootstrap-sass/assets/fonts/bootstrap/';
@import '~bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap';

to 'src/styles/style.scss' instead of 'src/app/app.component.scss' as wiki suggest.

[ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
Don't know if it was just for me, but following ""How to use Bootstrap 3 and Sass and ng2 bootstrap"" wiki page caused bootstrap glyphicon to not load on aot production build.

Managed to fix my issue by including 
$icon-font-path: '~bootstrap-sass/assets/fonts/bootstrap/';
@import '~bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap';

to 'src/styles/style.scss' instead of 'src/app/app.component.scss' as wiki suggest.

Thought I share my experience if anyone comes into the same issue.


* **What is the current behavior?**
bootstrap glyphicon not loading in app child components on aot production build.


* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).

Pull repo
Follow ""How to use Bootstrap 3 and Sass and ng2 bootstrap"" wiki
npm run build:aot 
npm run server:prod


* **What is the expected behavior?**
glyphicon loading


* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**



* **Please tell us about your environment:**

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of typescript.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Hi,

I've tried to access the angularclass.com support links to make sure before i post this one if this is a bug or not but with no success.

I wonder why when i clone this repository and do npm intall and then when i try to inject any simple service 
into the home or about component I get this error 
""
[at-loader] Checking finished with 1 errors
[at-loader] compiled\src\app\home\home.component.ngfactory.ts:36:20
    TS2346: Supplied parameters do not match any signature of call target.
""

here is my test.service.ts file 
""
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()
export class Test {
    constructor() {

    }
}
""
this is the home.component.ts modification i make
import { Test } from '../services/test.service';

  providers: [    
    AppState,
    Title,
    Test
  ],

  // TypeScript public modifiers
  constructor(     
    public appState: AppState,    
    public title: Title,
    private test:Test
  ) {}
""
and simply i cannot get away from the error I'm getting.

when i take a look at the compiled\src\app\home\home.component.ngfactory.ts:36:20 file
i see this :
""
  constructor(p0:any,p1:any) {
    this._changed = false;
    this.context = new import0.HomeComponent(p0,p1);
  }
""
So obviously the constructor parameter signature is not right and I cannot find the spot where I can fix this and I wonder if this is some sort of a bug or something else ?",mafina1984,AngularClass

[ ] question about the decisions made in the repository

* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**

Hi! When I am running `npm start` it doesn't check for linting files like  `.json.ts` (unexpected)  and `.spec.ts (expected)`. The excluded spec files are expected, since in the configuration you have `exclude: [/\.(spec|e2e)\.ts$/]`. If I do `npm run lint` I get linting for those as well. If I remove  `exclude: [/\.(spec|e2e)\.ts$/]` from the configuration it still excluded .spec.ts and .json.ts so this might be a tslint-loader bug..

* **What is the current behavior?**

while the configuration only exludes .spec.ts files and e2e.spec files it is still skipping .json.ts files.

* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).

* **What is the expected behavior?**

it should check for linting `.json.ts` files

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

it doesn't make since when something is not excluded to be excluded

I'm not sure whether that means a bug or feature, but when I'm trying to brush my code with prefixes, its behavior seemed be wrong, or I'm doing wrong.

While I import scss file directly at app.component.ts '../styles/styles.scss';  they were not added with prefixes. But using another your example with adding scss file directly at App Component with 
styleUrls: [ './app.component.scss' ], it become prefixable

I´m not sure if it is a bug or a feature reqquest.

The current behavior is, that webcomponents on browsers where the polyfills kick in are not working.
Can you give me a advise how to change the configuration of the project to load the main module just after the Webcomponentsready Event?

I can bundle my application with webcomponents/polymer for development and for production. Even with aot enabled.

Webcomponents/polymer are just so much nicer components to build a state of the art web application and don´t have to to the boilerplet again and again.

Both.

* **What is the current behavior?**

When ``compiled`` directory is empty or non-existing, running ``npm run build:dev`` results in an error from awesome-typescript-loader:





* **What is the expected behavior?**

Build should not produce errors even if ``compiled`` directory doesn't exist or is empty, since directory is not needed for a dev build without aot.


* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

Was able to work around this by:

in ``webpack.common.js``


in ``tsconfig.json``:



Then ``npm run build:dev`` finishes without errors. Still ``npm run build:prod`` causes the same error message.

when you used Gulp I imagine you didn't do it on Angular 2 right? so instead of blaming webpack try to understand the environment :)

CSS in angular `@Component`s are not part of the global CSS you used to have in Gulp and that was loaded via a HTML link tag.

CSS that you attach to components is part of the bundle, if you refresh CSS the whole ngModule must refresh.

It is possible that the reloading can improve, but it will take time once people fully realise the process and webpack will adapt.",shlomiassaf,Component

I have a component that has html as follows:

      <div id=""partners-slider"" class=""partners"">
            <div class=""partners__slider js-slick-slider"">
              <a class=""partners__item""><img src=""assets/logo-company-1.png"" alt="""">Elite Construction Group, LLC</a>
              <a class=""partners__item""><img src=""assets/logo-company-2.png"" alt="""">Pro Era Limited</a>
             </div></div>



Its basically a slider.
I have a library that I use in a lot of projects, for animations and stuffs. 

Theres a function as follows that initiates a slider:



    function initPartnersSlider(container) {
    var $partnersSlider = $(container) ;
    if (!$partnersSlider.length) return;

    $partnersSlider
      .find('.js-slick-slider')
      .slick({
        dots: false,
        infinite: true,
        speed: 300,
        slidesToShow: 5,
        autoplay: true,
        accessibility: false,
        prevArrow: $partnersSlider.find('.js-partners-prev'),
        nextArrow: $partnersSlider.find('.js-partners-next'),
        responsive: [
          {
            breakpoint: 1100,
            settings: {
              slidesToShow: 4
            }
          },
          {
            breakpoint: 1000,
            settings: {
              slidesToShow: 3
            }
          },
          {
            breakpoint: 768,
            settings: {
              slidesToShow: 1
            }
          }
        ]
      });}


Function Call:
`initPartnersSlider('#partners-slider');`

Problem here is 

    $partnersSlider.length

is always 0.

As per my understanding, the html element is placed inside a minified file by webpack (prod)

> main.bundle.js

 I am referring my external javascript file inside index.html as a script tag. It doesnt seem to recognise the dom element with `id=""properties-slider""` as the element is inside main.bundle.js?. I am able to debug and see it in my library code.

Has anyone done that before?

Added pug support and when I try to do

1407,2017-01-23 23:08:35,"@gilhanan I'm using sass resource loader, it's great.

The problem is that it does not play nicely with relative imports.
It requires you to add **ALL** virtual SCSS files into the resource array in the webpack plugin configuration which is something that adds a lot of noise to the starter.  
I can live with that... but most devs won't know about it so they will just add `@imports` to the `_variable` file... we'll end up supporting sass resource loader.

About the commit

```
This is getting too lengthy, we need to move it to an object based loader configuration.
It adds to my comment above, consider the need for multiple SCSS variable files... 

This is a common thing, you usually divide these files to categories.

* **What is the current behavior?**
I have fonts located under `/assets/fonts`. When I try to use one in CSS I get the following error:

I add `url-loader` for font files and HMR and Prod builds work as expected. Fonts get inlined under a certain threshold and saved with a hash above this threshold. However, when running an AOT build, inlined fonts work but files which are expected to be saved externally are not created so I get 404s for `http://127.0.0.1:8080/fonts/629a55a7e793da068dc580d184cc0e31.ttf` 

* **What is the expected behavior?**
I would like to have AOT builds which save fonts separate from the bundle. Otherwise I'm forced to inline everything and bundle sizes are very large.

1406,2017-01-31 16:06:28,"@bmayen the issue in #1428 happens on non-inlined assets within component templates/styles.

Are you loading fonts in component styles? bit excessive... if so turn `resourceOverride` off until the AOT plugin will handle assets.

Long story short, `resourceOverride` removes template/styles from `@Component` to remove space and let the AOT compiler handle them.
If you have resources in components then they won't get copied...

The modules are loaded at startup due to the route strategy, this is configurable.

They are still asynchronous, they just load automatically at startup but a separate bundle is there for each module.

This update doesn't add new functionality, it's more syntax related.

End result for all async code styles (require.ensure, System.import and import()) is logically the same...

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As npm-run-all is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

1382,2017-01-16 15:53:28,"This upgrades to ngc-webpack 1.1.2

In 1.1.0 depends on `@angular/tsc-wrapper` and `@angular/compiler-cli`

When `@angular/compiler-cli` bumps `@angular/tsc-wrapper` then **ngc-webpack** needs to do so as well... which is not ideal.

`@angular/compiler-cli` actually is `@angular/tsc-wrapper` since it re-exports all of the tsc-wrapper api... 

1.1.2 uses `@angular/compiler-cli` only.

I had a break when trying to compile a complex setup, took me 1 hour to find the culprit, `@angular/compiler-cli` was using `@angular/tsc-wrapper` 0.5.1 while **ngc-webpack** was using 0.5.0 :/

**Note that for some reason the tests fail on NODE 5, I don't know why yet... so this version is 6+**
The error:


The build using 2 steps (ngc-w -> webpack) from the cli works!

1379,2017-01-20 21:58:00,"@DanielYKPan I just simply used the html-loader instead of the raw-loader.

I started to look at https://github.com/TheLarkInn/angular2-template-loader. However, I'm not sure if that's right. There's got to be an easier way to rewrite the paths.

@d3viant0ne Can you provide any insight into this issue?",jgornick,d3viant0ne
1379,2017-01-23 15:27:19,"@DanielYKPan I've found a solution that worked for me:



That configuration will run any required HTML files through the `html-loader` (see `angular2-template-loader`). The `html-loader` requires any paths specified in `img:src` (i.e. images). Because the images are now being required into the dependency graph, we use the `file-loader` for any required `jpg|png|gif` images and write their path to `/assets/img/[name].[ext]`. Now the URLs in the HTML templates have the correct path to the image assets specified in `img:src` (e.g. `{output.publicPath}/assets/img/[name].[ext]`). 

This also plays nicely with the `CopyWebpackPlugin` found in the `webpack.common.js` configuration.

@d3viant0ne Is it worth submitting a pull request to run the HTML templates through the `html-loader`?",jgornick,d3viant0ne
1378,2017-01-16 10:18:07,"This PR improves the efficiency of the TypeScript build and resolves several issues that result from TypeScript compiling unnecessary files.

The current behavior is that on every build TypeScript compiles every single `.ts` file in the project tree. This is inefficient and can lead to issues when different files in the project require different configurations or use conflicting Typings.

The solution is to tell TypeScript specifically which entry files to compile, and it will automatically compile all their needed dependencies too. With this configuration TypeScript avoids compiling unnecessary files. `awesome-typescript-loader` doesn't seem to support passing in a configuration object, so this PR introduces a Webpack plugin which writes a temporary `tsconfig.json` file containing the correct entry files.

The only drawback is that lazy loaded modules need to be declared in `src/app/lazy-loaded.ts` or they will not get compiled. Maybe @shlomiassaf can write a script that automatically detects and adds them.

- Resolves #1366 
- Improves #1364 

Overall this PR makes builds faster, avoids some Typings conflict issues, and makes watch mode more efficient by watching only necessary files. It is also needed for my Electron branch to separately watch the main and renderer builds.",colinskow,shlomiassaf

bug


* **What is the current behavior?**
When building using `npm run build:prod; npm run server:prod` the `process` variable is not defined.


* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).

**this was reproduced using a fresh pulldown of the master branch with only the change listed below**

1. add the line `console.debug(""PROCESS: "", process);` to the AppComponent (`ngOnInit` works).
2. run the project via `npm run start`
3. something similar to `PROCESS:  Object {title: ""browser"", browser: true, env: Object, argv: Array[0], version: """"…}` should be displayed in the browser console.
4. run the project via `npm run build:prod` and `npm run server:prod`
5. An error is displayed indicating that `process` is not defined.

* **What is the expected behavior?**
the global `process` variable is defined.


* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
this is a show-stopping bug that breaks any libraries that depend on the `process` polyfill.


* **Please tell us about your environment:**

- Angular version: 2.4.3
- Browser: Version 55.0.2883.95 (64-bit)

This is my take on DLL integration: Using a plugin to control the whole process.

The plugin internally injects the low level DLL plugins provided by webpack (`DllPlugin`, `DllRegerencePlugin`) into the webpack instances.

The plugin handles both the webpack instance it get's registered on and a new webpack instance it creates for bundle generation.

The sole purpose of this plugin is to detect changes to the bundle structure.

Few points:
  - The plugin is async (promises). This is for future support of webpack package resolution (currently using node). This is important since webpack can resolve from other directories other then `node_module`.

  - The plugin is ready for live re-bundling. It detects a change in the package level so it can trigger a build per bundle. This will come in handy once live re-bundling is supported.

  - No need for extra configuration, everything is in the plugin, no extra commands.  
This makes it super easy to opt-out, just remove the plugin from `plugins`

> If a package is missing the process will throw (using the current config), it will not install from `npm` or `yarn`. This is how it should be, the plugin is not responsible for fetching packages, it just bundles the existing.

Change to the repo is minimal.

`ngc-webpack@1.1.0` comes with 2 major improvements:

  - Run the angular complier from the `NgcWebpackPlugin`  
this makes configuration easier, removes cli steps and provides more control over the compilation

  - Remove `@Component` resources (template/styles) from the bundle.  
This is actually a great improvement to bundle size...
For each `@Component` the AOT compiler compiles it creates new representation for the templates (html, styles) of that `@Components`. It means that there is no need for the source templates, they take a lot of space... **Webpack** bundles out source files and the compiler files (`ngfactory`) so we get 2 versions of the same template/style in our bundle.  
This feature is `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin` for identified resources... the templates are replaced with empty files.

* **What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)
As described in #1330 


* **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**
Introduce Webpack DLL feature to speed up build times during DEV builds only.


* **Other information**:
As mentioned in the issue comments, this feature is worth having for large projects. This PR is an attempt to do this with minimal changes to common webpack config thereby trying to strike balance between huge config blocks and having to rewrite all of webpack common config.

1st step: update typescript from 2.0.10 to 2.1.4;
2nd step: npm run build:aot:prod

* **What is the expected behavior?**

The aot build success.

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

I want to use async/await, which is supported with typescript 2.1.4 when set the tsconfig's target to es5.
Although I can use babel + typescript to supported it, I still don't want to import other packages.

Just asking a question...

* **What is the current behavior?**

In the master branch AOT is configured and works very well.
But  the mentions to tree shaking are limited and not very clear.
Nevertheless, the size of the output in the current build:aot goes from 3,123 to 493 kb.

When I look in other sources for Tree shaking, it says that apparently needs a special configuration on tsconfig to use a different module management.

So my question is: Does the current version has Tree shaking or we can expect even smaller sizes when it becomes implemented?

That's all, small question....

I'm honestly confused by this repo. The V6 branch is based on https://github.com/qdouble/angular-webpack2-starter which is at the moment one of the best starters when you want both AOT and DLLs. V6 was more tidy though, cleaned up, a little better file structure, typescript used in configs etc. a pretty good start, and the best thing was that it was using using @ngtools/webpack, so it was less hacky than qdouble's starter. There were couple of issues(https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/issues/885#issuecomment-257735362) mostly with @ngtools/webpack, which kinda blocked it, most of them are now resolved though.

1330,2017-01-05 07:41:10,"Good news, building on @abhishekisnot's pull request I've gotten this working in a way that doesn't require refactor and is highly unlikely to break any existing builds.

The DLL packages must be specified manually in a config file, but anything not included there will simply fall back into the common chunks. I'm even working on a script that will intelligently update the DLLs when a dependent package changes.

This will require testing in the wild to ensure it doesn't break anything, but I think it should be safe to enable by default rather than opt-in, which would complicate things with lots of additional build scripts. The dev build speed benefits are huge.",colinskow,abhishekisnot

Bug


* **What is the current behavior?**
Sourcemaps are no longer correct, since v5.2.0 (AOT support) when debugging TypeScript code, e.g. in browser (Chrome).


* **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).
1) Debugging TypeScript code works correctly with sourcemaps in version before v5.2.0 (02716cc21a3f53f62f12aad5ae22c20dbe421048), so try that, e.g. home.component.
2) Debugging in any version after (02716cc21a3f53f62f12aad5ae22c20dbe421048) does not work as expected. Breakpoints are hit in incorrect locations and cannot be set in others.



* **What is the expected behavior?**
Correct sourcemaps for debugging with TypeScript.


* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
It has worked before and must work in order to be productive.

1310,2016-12-31 01:26:03,"@feddyups No, `test: /\.scss$/` is to generic, it will take all SCSS files and send them to the header.

There are 2 types of stylesheets in an angular 2 application
 - Global styles (goes to head)
 - Component styles (live within the component)

Each component has a `ViewEncapsulation` property that defines the interaction of the styles so it's important to have SCSS files stay within the component.

Global styles can be in a specific app or prefixed, it's up to you actually (see #1304 and comments)

@BkSouX The error you posted indicates that the `@angular/compiler` tried to fetch a resource that was in the `styleUrls` of a component but it wasn't there.

This error also indicates that you are using an older version of this repo since this resource is loaded by the `compiler-cli` and not `ngc-webpack`

Anyway, if the file is not present `ngc-webpack` will throw as well...

check your files...

1304,2016-12-28 23:41:56,"@colinskow I used a different take on this.

I used a convention to identify global SCSS files: `some-style.global.scss`

Then a loader:


> The component SCSS loader must also `exclude: [/\.global\.scss$/],`

Now all `*.global.scss` files are set in the head.

This is of course not a separate file for styles but it differentiates between global and component local styles.


Now, for having styles in a separate file, this is something I think the developer should decide.

I think we should put the extract plugin to target 1 file, all other files the dev wants to include he should import from that main (and not from JS code).

If he imports from JS code it goes to the head.

**My reasoning about this is that if all styles are in 1 directory it's far more logical to import them all from one file inside that directory, similar to an `index`file in a package/module/barrel.**

I see this directory as the `theme` for the app, plus it's more aligned with SASS `@import`s...

I have a problem with style imports scattered around the project, it's hard tracking their order and that's important for CSS.",shlomiassaf,import
1304,2016-12-29 01:56:52,"The order of the CSS will be the order the files were imported. I've created a styles directory where all the external styles will originate, and I think we should leave it to the developer to choose a convention. They are not scattered around the project, except for the Angular component styles which are inlined with the JS.

I library like Bootstrap can be imported by putting a file in the styles directory and using @import.",colinskow,import
1304,2017-01-04 00:43:25,"@d3viant0ne it doesn't appear we have any disagreements with this PR. @shlomiassaf suggests using the naming convention `*.global.scss` for external stylesheets, but I believe this is not necessary with everything in the `src/styles` directory.

I suggest we merge this so I can start working on other enhancements like DLLs without having to rebase.",colinskow,d3viant0ne
1304,2017-01-04 01:16:53,"1.) Rebase it.

2.) As far as conventions go, they are much like words in scrabble. `Common Use`

In this case, I think it would be best to not enforce conventions on people. If a developer wants to do something like @shlomiassaf is suggesting, they can extend the project as they see fit.

The most common way I have seen / used in regards to scss and 3rd party styles would be to use `@import` in something like `main.scss / styles.scss` at the root of a project or styles directory.

report a *bug* After typescript 2.0.6 the build process stuck at loading js. No debug error happens but seems infinite burning CPU.

404s will fallback to /index.html                                                                                                67% building modules 1165/1226 modules 61 active ...

No debug log and nothing different to verbose mode.
I also switch between node from 7.2.1 to 6.9.2 nothing changed.
The stuck point is building a module that if I remove that module it stuck to another one. so something general must be wrong during the module js file loading.


Solution is to fix the typescript version to 2.0.6 instead of ^2.0.6

1272,2016-12-14 16:11:27,"bug report
report a *bug* After typescript 2.0.6 the build process stuck at loading js. No debug error happens but seems infinite burning CPU.

Stuck point: 

Project is running at http://localhost:8888/
webpack output is served from /
Content not from webpack is served from xxxxxxxx
404s will fallback to /index.html                                                                                                67% building modules 1165/1226 modules 61 active ...

No debug log and nothing different to verbose mode.
I also switch between node from 7.2.1 to 6.9.2 nothing changed.
The stuck point is building a module that if I remove that module it stuck to another one. so something general must be wrong during the module js file loading.


Solution is to fix the typescript version to 2.0.6 instead of ^2.0.6

https://plnkr.co or similar (you can use this template as a starting point: http://plnkr.co/edit/tpl:AvJOMERrnz94ekVua0u5).

I used the steps described in the wiki, but used different package versions, because of incompatibilitites:

npm install --save-dev sass-loader@^4.0.2 css-to-string-loader  resolve-url-loader file-loader url-loader tslint@^4.0.0 css-loader@^0.25.0 codelyzer@^2.0.0-beta.3 node-sass@^3.13.1
npm install --save bootstrap-sass ng2-bootstrap

Everything else I did according to the wiki entry.

* **What is the expected behavior?**

Bootstrap path is loaded in scss file

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

Use of Bootstrap 3 and Sass and ng2-bootstrap

* **Please tell us about your environment:**

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

It may be a minor patch; but wanted to confirm before doing so.

The following line uses [arguments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments) object rather than using `args` variable passed to the respective function `root`. Is there a specific reason for doing so, or is this redundant?

I've started using the angular2-webpack-starter app.  After using a bit, I wanted to install another package.  I run the npm install -g <package> command and that's about as far as I get.  I'm not sure where I need to go to ensure my app recognizes this new package.  For the novices out there, it would be good to understand how to get webpack/angular2 to recognize any new packages that were install.

I've search high and low for an example on this but apparently I'm not asking the right question, or I'm just not understanding the differences in how webpack and native angular 2 are setup.  Having a writeup explaining the differences and examples on how to properly wire up a new package would be great.

not sure it matters, but the specific package was ng2-nouislider

1. Modified `package.json` to set:

- `""typescript"": ""2.1.1""` (use to be `^2.0.6`, which brought me `v2.1.4`)
- `""@angular/forms"": ""2.2.1""` (use to be `^2.2.1`, which brought me `v2.3.0`, when other `@angular/` were `2.2.1`). As an alternative, you can make them all `^2.2.1` and it will work again as all `@angular/` versions will be aligned.

2. Deleted corresponding folders in `node_modules` and ran `npm install`. For some reason, running `npm install` straight away didn't work (something was cached?).

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As protractor is “only” a devDependency of this project it **might not break production or downstream projects**, but “only” your build or test tools – **preventing new deploys or publishes**.

I recommend you give this issue a high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

### Error Unexpected value 'FileUploadModule' imported by the module 'UploaderModule'
valor-software/ng2-file-upload#426

Is there a reason - why - we need relative paths for external Typescript modules?
Is it a systemjs that cannot load - a typescript only NODE_MODULE


C:\workspace\angular2-webpack-starter\config\webpack.common.js
**Does not work** - modules: [helpers.root('src'), 'node_modules' ],
**Works - modules:** [helpers.root('src'), helpers.root('node_modules' )],


### How to replicate?

1. npm install - https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter
2. npm install https://github.com/georgebatalinski/PUBLIC_NODE_MODULE
3. C:\workspace\angular2-webpack-starter\src\app\app.module.ts

4. npm start 
Expected: get error 

####TO fix 
C:\workspace\angular2-webpack-starter\config\webpack.common.js
**change** - modules: [helpers.root('src'), 'node_modules' ],
**to** [helpers.root('src'), helpers.root('node_modules' )],

the link to the slack channel is broken, so I try to aks my question here.

I try to get an external Css Lib (KendoUi for Ng2) to get loaded with webpack and Ng2.

So my Question is the wiki entry tells how to load styles with the StyleUrl, is the compiled style included in the bundle.js or an additional entry in my index.html as bundle.css?

https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-use-Bootstrap-3-and-Sass-and-ng2-bootstrap

Because I've get my kendo styles working with the templateUrl like you describe, but my problem is that the styles are only accessable in the component I loaded the styles. When I use navigate to an other view where I've not included the styleUrl then the styles are not globaly loaded. Is there a magic trick that this works?

    @Component({
       selector: 'sxp-app',
       templateUrl: './app.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./../../node_modules/@telerik/kendo-theme-default/dist/all.css']

My Loader Entry

      {
           test: /\.css$/,
           use: ['to-string-loader', 'css-loader']
     },

that works fine for local styles but not global, how can I get my styles to be global or better how to render the styles as .css in my index.html?

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
*feature*


* **What is the current behavior?**
css is inlined in bundle. 
would like to be able to directly edit css files through the broweser - with Chrome's workspace feature.
(would probably need source maps from inline styling to css files in src/)


* **What is the expected behavior?**
editing CSS on Chrome browser with configured workspace would change local files permanently in src/ directory.

This is how the browser style pane look now, the style is inline and not as part of any file :

* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
Editing CSS directly save a LOT of time - when changes reflect immediately in the browser and saved to the source files.
As a designer, I try different style options (eg. border weight/color) until I find the right one. When I do, the best thing would be if it would be saved in the source files.

So far, this is the only thing keeping me off from using Angular 2.

Angular Material integration is quite straight forward.

Saying that, if you are using bootstrap loader and saas loader like, it's very easy to include material scss.

in **.bootstraprc** add the below line.

`appStyles: PATH_TO_YOUR_APPLICATION_SCSS`

I meet this error when I try to build my app (npm run build) : 

> optimizationError in bail mode: [default] /node_modules/@types/core-js/index.d.ts:21:13 Duplicate identifier 'PropertyKey'.

I tried to remove from package.json the line ""typescript"": ""2.0.3"", because there was a conflict between this and ""@types/core-js"", but now the builder doesn't find my modules defined in ""src"" with aliases I defined.

> optimizationError in bail mode: [default] /server/backelite/odigo/front/src/app/app.component.ts:3:28
> Cannot find module 'services/user.service'

The root ""service"" is aliased (to avoid `import ../../services/user.service` for exemple)

* **Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**
BUG


* **What is the current behavior?**
TypeError: this.http.get(...).map is not a function


* **Steps to reproduce**

  1. Clone the repository
  2. Checkout [v6](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/tree/v6) branch
  3. add `import { Http } from '@angular/http';` in `app.component.ts` and call API inside `ngOnInit` as   below :
      `this.http.get('http://your.apiurl.com').map((res) => res.json()).subscribe((res) => { console.log(res); });`

  4. serve application with `npm start` and visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in browser it will throw error TypeError: this.http.get(...).map is not a function in browser console


   Instead of serving with with `npm start` if i will first run `npm run build:aot` and then serve application with `npm run server:prod` then its running application and not throwing error `TypeError: this.http.get(...).map is not a function`



* **What is the expected behavior?**
It needs to run application without any error.



* **Please tell us about your environment:**

I think it comes from `@angular/compiler-cli: ""^2.1.1""` in `package.json`.

- **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** via
- If i use this configuration ...



I will get the ERROR :  **Cannot read property 'path' of undefined at Object.resolveUrlLoader**
- If i add `?sourceMap` with sass-loader ...



I will get the ERROR : **path must be a string. Received undefined** 
- **What is the expected behavior?**
  it should be work ( like i use it in webpack 1 )
- **Please tell us about your environment:**
- same as latest verison of this repo
- Browser: Chrome
- **Other information** (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

The release notes for v5.0.5 are misleading. The release notes show:

>  v5.0.5 - 52b4d4e
> Title: Angular 2
> @katallaxie katallaxie released this on Sep 2 · 35 commits to master since this release
> 
> @angular/*-2.0.0

The above suggests that the latest version (5.0.5) is on Angular 2.0.0, but taking a look at the package.json file, angular is still only on RC6. A long away off 2.0.0.

Manually updating package.json to 2.0.0 or 2.1.0 has no effect due to npm shrinkwrap forcing it back down to RC6.

3 questions:
1. Can the release notes be updated to be clear that this is NOT 2.0.0, but it is RC6. Or if the chosen commit for that tag was incorrect, and it should be 2.0.0, can the tag be updated.
2. The code in master is on angular 2.0.0, but using latest master (039deb5) causes other dependancy warnings. What is the most stable 2.0.0 commit, if there is one. Is perhaps the 2.1.0 branch more stable/ready yet?
3. What are the pros/cons/reasons one would need/want to continue to use the angular class starter kit over doing webpack yourself. I like the starter kit, but having this dependancy in the middle preventing us from using the latest released version of angular is causing an issue for us. If someone could outline the pros and cons of not using the starter kit, that would be appreciated, to help decide the best course of action.

_Note: I took out all the other questions in the template bug report, as this does not apply to a specific environment, and is a question about the repo/code in general. Can provide the info if needed._

  [X] question about the decisions made in the repository
- **What is the current behavior?**

When I use a image as a background for a css class, i place the image in the assets folder and the image is displayed fine on the browser. The problem occurs with the images not showing when I generate the dist files, place the generated dist files on a CDN like Akamai and access the dist files from my JBoss application. 

If my application url is jboss.com and the dist files of all the js files and my images (assets) are placed in say akamai.com, the css being served well, but since the css is part of the main.bundle.js and loaded on the DOM, it is attempting to load the image from jboss.com instead of from akamai.com. 

Only if I load the css directly on the head without including it as a StyleUrl in the Angular2 component, it will actually look for the image in the CDN and render it on the application. 

P.S: I currently have the ViewEncapsulation set to NONE.
- **What is the expected behavior?**

Expected behavior should be the image should load from the CDN. 
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

To not place static resources like the images in the application server and serve them from a CDN.

I was trying to convert the location strategy from hash to path. I did try a variety of stuff in my ngModule:

Github pages is one but also [webpack.dev.js#23](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/config/webpack.dev.js#L23)  and [webpack.prod.js#27](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/config/webpack.prod.js#L27) assume it's there.

I will duplicate the `metadata` property in `webpack.common.js` to be both on root object and in `HtmlWebpackPlugin` for now to restore order.

However, some refactoring is needed since the logical process is wrong.
`HtmlWebpackPlugin` is set in `webpack.common.js` but a user might want to alter some values in dev/prod... 

It's not for this topic but I think common should have a pre process callback that can get the (almost) final config object and do some work such as adding plugins etc using updated/final objects.

I think an issue is needed for this, for now I will just duplicate to restore github pages functionality.

Disabling hash navigation and navigating to any route that is not the root route renders the following

`<% if (webpackConfig.htmlElements.headTags) { %> <%= webpackConfig.htmlElements.headTags %> <% } %> Loading... <% if (webpackConfig.metadata.isDevServer && webpackConfig.metadata.HMR !== true) { %> <% } %>

This is the custom Module in our SDK.



loading it in app.module.ts throws the error above, which seems to originate from missing the @NgModule Decorator. The SDK works fine in ng2-admin from akveo which is build on the angular2-webpack-starter.

1062,2016-10-07 22:57:03,"Here's how I got Sass working with Hot Module Replacement in my app. 
- In dev mode, Hot Module Replacement is enabled for Sass
- In production mode, all styles are extracted into an external .css file - to prevent ""flash"" of unstyled content and allow caching of css.

My loader for SCSS - works fast and easy


- `sass-vars-loader` allows you to load a JS file with exported variables, then import them into every scss file.
- `sass-resources` loads up a specified array of .scss files, and prepends them before every .scss file is compiled. Useful for appwide variables and mixins.
- `postcss` allows you to do lots of cool stuff, like autoprefix classes with vendor prefixes.

Here's how to specify the options for each of those loaders



This is where `sassVarsConfig` is defined:



Here's how to setup the `sass-js-variables.js`



Lastly, instead of using angular2's `styleUrls` or `styles` properties of the @Component decorator, I opt to do it like this instead:



I import the scss outside of the @Component decorator. Why? Because this way I get Hot Module Replacement to work on my .scss files, and it allows my styles to apply globally. I then simply namespace my .scss files with the selector for each specific component, which creates an encapsulated style to prevent it from affecting other components:



That's it.  [Here's my repo](https://github.com/IAMtheIAM/angular2-webpack2-dotnet-starter) which is a fork of this repo, that shows all this off in action. (Note: its using .NET core to host the app, so you'll need .NET Core SDK installed in order to run it)

Hi, 

I was wondering what the preloader on .ts files to use the `string-replace-loader` would be used for in a project.  I'm not an expert in javascript/the module ecosystem by any means, but this is what I think that part does:
- node, commonjs, amd, systemjs all have different ways that they resolve/import javascript modules
- this checks your code in case you have a module that is targeted toward a systemjs runtime (I'm shaky on what this actually entails/if you can use it in tandem with other types of modules)
- it replaces the `import` to import the module then does..... something.

I'd appreciate if anyone could clarify this.  If this is more suited to StackOverflow or a Slack channel somewhere, please let me know and I will close this issue.

  [ x] question about the decisions made in the repository

This is more of a general question on git + Angular2 development practice with this starter. How should one keep angular2-webpack-starter code up to date when you start commiting your own app code to pulled repository? I've never used a 'starter' code before from another repository to build my app on top of it so I'm wondering how to keep commiting your own app code and keep pulling all new updates of angular2-webpack-starter's code?

1024,2016-09-20 19:40:03,"Hi guys,

I am creating a sample application in angularjs 2.0. While developement I came across with a serious problem - I can't inject anything to the component through the constructor function.

I used the following code for importing ItemService from app.item.service.ts
`import { ItemService } from './app.item.service';`

Then I specified provider as 



After that, given code for TodoComponent as



When I try to inject ItemService through constructor , I am getting an error : "" Error: Can't resolve all parameters for TodoComponent: (?).""
I am not able to inject even angularjs providers like Injector.

However, this method works for me  : 



I am using the following versions of libraries for developement as mentioned in my package.json

  [x ] question about the decisions made in the repository

The readme states ""We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic.""

However, RC6 removed @Component.directives (deprecated in a previous RC) which indicates to me that the angular team is supporting a module pattern. it doesn't really make sense to add a bunch of declarations in your `app.module.ts` that won't be used by the entire app, but only by specific components. this might be a weak example, but `home` uses the `x-large` directive but `about` may never need to have the ability to use that directive.

Does this make sense or am I misunderstanding the Angular team's intentions?

Webpack 2.0 now supports the ES 2015 module syntax, so we should be able to configure the TypeScript compiler to emit ES2015 module syntax (import/export statements).

Trying to install a dependency (imdb-api) https://www.npmjs.com/package/imdb-api

I have installed imdb-api, and can see it in my node-modules.
Using the newest webpack.

My package json file looks like this:
**package.json file**
    ""ie-shim"": ""^0.1.0"",
    ""imdb-api"": ""^2.0.0"",
    ""rxjs"": ""5.0.0-beta.12"",
    ""zone.js"": ""~0.6.17""

Then In a component, I have tried to import it or require it, but none seem to work.

**What i have tried:**
import { imdb } from 'imdb-api';
then made a console.log(imdb); in the constructor. 

and

var imdb = require('imdb-api');
console.log(imdb) in the constructor. 

All this gives alot of errors which I can google myself to. Have tried imdb-api in another solution (not webpack) and here it works.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of protractor.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of protractor.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

Think once you update this project to RC7 you might get the same warnings? Any ideas how to fix this?

Edit: This is really sloppy, but to get rid of the warnings just comment out line 32 in node_modules/webpack/lib/dependencies/ContextDependencyHelpers.js until proper fix is available.

I am having trouble hosting the site live. It's working great when I use `npm run server` and check localhost:3000

![angular2_webpack_starter_by__gdi2290_from__angularclass](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5354163/18410755/c6ad6c9c-7737-11e6-9a82-d3f5f6f90f4a.png)

and also when I run `npm run server:prod` and check localhost:8080:

![angular2_webpack_starter_by__gdi2290_from__angularclass](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5354163/18410762/e9aae094-7737-11e6-85e1-be1c3a8b188c.png)

Nice! 

I then go to host the site through the Github gh-pages branch. My project is named ""SafeFoods"" and gh-pages adds an extra _SafeFoods_ into the path here in the address bar. The problem with this is that I have files looking to be loaded at a path that doesn't have _SafeFoods_ (but is otherwise identical).

I have tried changing ""baseUrl"" in the webpack.common.js file, but this breaks the site when I run the dev server and prod server!

Does anyone know how I can make it so that the site works in all three situations?
thanks.

968,2016-10-24 02:11:20,"### Considering becoming an Angular CLI template or using @ngtools/webpack

With the Angular CLI becoming so powerful and central to workflow, it's a good time to consider if this starter makes sense to work as an Angular CLI template. See ""[App Creation Using Template](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/Stories#app-creation-using-template)"" in the CLI wiki. Becoming a template would look something like this for a user to get started:

`ng new my-ng2-app --template=angular2-webpack-starter`

Or adopting [`@ngtools/webpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/~ngtools) to not miss out on any of the innovations happening on the CLI like ""code splitting"" (see below) and other optimizations. 

See the benefits and ability to use `@ngtools/webpack` standalone from the Angular CLI as presented in [Stephen Fluin's Angular CLI talk](https://youtu.be/uBRK6cTr4Vk?t=6m45s) at Angular Connect 2016:
- Compiles SCSS/LESS
- TypeScript transpilation
- Bundles JavaScript, CSS
- Asset optimization
- Virtual filesystem for assets
  - For serving local assets and compile versions.
- Live-reload via websockets
- Code splitting
  - Recognizing the use of loadChildren in the router, and bundling those modules separately so that any dependencies of those modules are not going to be loaded as part of your main bundle. These separate bundles will be pulled out of the critical path of your application, making your total application bundle much smaller and loading it much more performant.
",mikeumus,ngtools
968,2016-10-24 02:39:56,"The next change to the repo would diverge from the current folder structure and the current style guide with the focus on production apps. The change would also include AoT,  DLL only for dev and SCSS (since it's the most popular one). Anything the CLI has will be included plus more depending on the opinions and style guide of @AngularClass. The only problem right now is finding the weekend to work on it or start training maintainers for future updates. The CLI and starter repos have different goals which is why this repo will always exist.

  [X] question about the decisions made in the repository

@katallaxie

While the enthusiasm is great, just slamming home changes without others having the opportunity to vet those changes kind of defeats the point of `community` & `code review`. 30 Commits directly to master, to include those to fix or remove features that shouldn't have landed between 27 Sept & 01 Aug.

It also means that everyone that uses the webpack-starter as a base project has to pick up those changes and merge them into what is usually a modified project, it gets tedious quickly.

I'm suggesting you start delivering changes as `complete, tested & vetted sets of work` through the standard `pull request` workflow that everyone else uses thus making the update process less labor intensive and less prone to blowing up peoples forks (which happened to me last week). 

`Landing your own code` is generally `frowned upon` and for good reason. A second ( or multiple ) sets of eyes is never, ever a bad thing.

938,2016-08-31 19:53:20,"Hey @HansS sorry we weren't more transparent and thanks for purchasing the Master Bundle. We have the courses on a new schedule that is not reflected on the website and the order might change up a bit. This is mostly due to fit Angular 2's release which is very soon and due to the recent changes in `2.0.0-rc.5`. We thought it would be better if we recreate the courses using the new approach after Angular 2 is released. The delay of the reactive course is mostly my fault going back and forth with @Hendrixer on if we should teach our new reactive architecture that we have, or to use the [angular2-observe-decorators](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-observe-decorators), or to focus only on reactivity and state management (our original plan). We were also thinking about if we should teach more RxJS or move that into the Modern JavaScript course or provide that as a mini-course. We decided to stick with our original plan because the observe-decorators is teaching a new way to manage your app with my own proposed spec that might change if it's merged with the Angular codebase. Our new reactive architecture has all of the features that everyone is talking about (rxjs, redux, sagas, effects) plus a ton of features that no-one is talking about (past/present/future states, interop, priority rendering, isolated loops, hot module replacement, webworkers, universal) and would need a few more iterations to unify the whole story. A lot of sugar is needed before we release it to make the API more intuitive and will most likely be a free course.

  In the vendor.ts file I added this line: import 'ng2-datetime/ng2-datetime';
  The build is successful but when the page loads I get an error that there is a missing directive (NKDatetime), although it appears in vendor.js
  The error appears at this line: var metadata = typeMetadata.find(_isDirectiveMetadata);
  _isDirectiveMetadata(type) returns false and metadata is null.
  NKDatetime is actually a component.

  typeMetadata.find(_isDirectiveMetadata) should not return null.

924,2016-08-29 18:53:28,"Hi,

don't know if its the right place to ask here but I'm 
trying to get this repo work with bootstrap 4 mixins.

I followed the wiki bootstrap 4 guide and everything
looks good.

But if I have an component for instance 

**home.component.ts**



and **home.style.scss**

`@include media-breakpoint-up(md) {
    .dosomething {
         padding: 0px;
    }
}`

I get 'No mixin named media-breakpoint-up'.

If i add the following line to **home.style.scss**
it works. But I don't know it it's the right thing todo.



So is it possible to inject _breakpoints.scss (mixins) and _variables.scss 
global or if its needed? Shouldn't webpack handle this case?

Regards

Couldn't we just use `""compiler"": ""@angular/tsc-wrapped""`?",jskrzypek,angular
885,2016-11-24 23:51:12,"Agree with @qdouble here. As it stands right now, I'm loving AoT but I have implemented it professionally in a similar fashion to Anthony, separate tasks executed explicitly. @ngtools/webpack has some outstanding issues that are blocking it's usefulness.

Small implementation details aside, the only really viable way to get AoT working in a meaningful way would be the route @qdouble took. Kind of wish I would have seen his starter prior to doing all that work myself :/ as we ended up in a similar place.

_**If the intent is to get AoT into this starter sooner rather than later,  qdouble/angular-webpack2-starter would be the path forward.**_ 

That said, there are some pretty significant challenges with AoT once you grow your application to anything of production size. `AoT is a commitment to building in a specific way`, most of which won't be apparent with the small starter application. For instance, anyone using Sass in the normal fashion of using require statements in components for styles are going to have a lot of work to do. 

If we are going to land AoT now, everyone should be ready for the onslaught of questions and issues when people try to pull in AoT enabled #master and their builds explode ( been there ... lol ). 

Also worth noting, if we are going to release AoT support we definitely need to test the AoT builds for PRs or we are going to be breaking master every other day ( been there too ).

So to solve your problem, first look if there is a ""@types"" for GSAP.

Server starts at localhost:3000 (as configured in webpack.dev.js)
- **What is the expected behavior?**

I'm trying to get this installed on a Vagrant machine, so I need to change the address to 0.0.0.0 (as per
https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/pull/205)

Additionally I will have a node server running on the same machine and the same default port (3000). So I'd like to be able to change the port as well.
- **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

I can do this by hand of course, but I'm trying to get a full MEAN with Angular 2 set up via Vagrant, and I'd like to get it as automated as possible, so it can basically be a starter pack for people. I don't really wanna fork this starter since you guys are actively updating it. 
- **Please tell us about your environment:**

Windows 7
Vagrant 1.8.5
Oracle Virtual Box 5.1.2

Inside the box:

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build kept failing**.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

- I have a project on which I've used this excellent starter as a base. Each time there are updates, I've updated my application - everything's been smooth.

But after updating to Typescript2.0 and @typings  I get some weird errors when I try to serve my app in development mode. During Webpack build, I get the following errors, after which my build halts completely without further messages.



When I look in the node_modules/typedoc folder, there isn't even a src folder!
Anyone have an idea of what the ***\* could be referencing typedoc source?

I've tried uninstall typedoc to no avail

  If you have an async route that has multiple children, and you attempt to load the page with the full URL (i.e. www.mydomain.com/route/childroute/params), an unhandled exception will be thrown for ""ChildRoute component cannot be found"".

I am using node.js 5.12.0 and NPM 3.8.6

When i open my site in System browser its taking 3 to 4 seconds to load/open.
Same site if i open in mobile phones its taking 8 to 10 seconds.
I want to reduce the time taken by load the app second time. 2nd time files are serving from cache. 
If all files serving from cache also taking same time to load page. 
I have used webpack to remove chunk. so now js file only 200kb(zip).

Most of the time user open site in mobile phones with 2g/3g speed. so user feel that site is taking more time to open, so in mobile phones site should open in max 3-4 seconds.

  Report a possible bug.
- **What is the current behavior?**
  Running tests with karma auto-watch active (npm run watch:test) does not always trigger the correct results, as it seems something is not fetching the correct last version of the code.
- **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem** 

Steps:
- clone the project
- npm install
- npm run watch:test
- \- the test are sucessfull
- change src/app.component.ts line 58 `url = 'https://twitter.com/AngularClass';` to `url = 'https://twitter.com/AngularClassXXXX'`
- the tests are **not sucessfull, which is correct**
- undo the change made on src/app.component.ts line 58
- the tests are **not sucessfull, which is incorrect**

So the **first change in code** after karma starts is always triggered, then the strange behaviour happens (cant find a pattern)
- subsequent changes are not trigger
- sometimes after a change in code, to trigger the correct behaviour I need to change a second file 

Seems something about karma-webpack-webpack-middleware is caching the old code or not syncing correctly.
- **What is the expected behavior?**
  Every last change in code reflected in the environment tests that are running with karma watch

Bug. 
- **What is the current behavior?**

I'm using Karma with the `singleRun` option set to `false` because I write the tests then reload the tab in Chrome (or I can set `autowatch` to `true`). So if I had the file with the below code (or any .ts file, spec or not):



Then if I run Karma and edited the file (say I add more tests). The console changes (it seems that Karma picks up the file change) but when reloading the test tab the changes are not there! So if I add 100 tests to the above. Karma will only run that one test unless I close Karma and open it again.
- **What is the expected behavior?**

Before #https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/commit/8add16dd55279b358e1a54af3541e1698354d323#diff-e5e546dd2eb0351f813d63d1b39dbc48 things weren't like this. I open Karma, edit my code, give it a few milliseconds to reload the files and then refresh the web page to see the test results.

I solved this by redoing the changes made in that commit, so that `ts.config` will look similar to this:



Why was `fileGlob` removed anyway?

  [x ] question about the decisions made in the repository
- **What is the current behavior?**
  The package.json file lists project dependencies. 
  I noticed that a lot of the ""project"" packages, for example @angular/\*  are  listed in the dependencies section.

I assume that when a project is built, all dependencies are put into the bundle files.
Therefore I would assume that all the files in the ""dependencies"" section really should be in the ""devDependencies"" section.

Let's for example say that you want to add a node backend (which is reasonable to think). 
You would install packages for the backend, and when you deploy the application you would copy your backend source to the destination server, and then run ""npm install --production""

This would effectively install all the @angular/\* packages in the production environment. A behaviour you don't want. Npm install --production installs all packages listed in the ""dependencies"" section.

So my question is:
Is there something I've completely missed - or should we not move all packages into the ""devDependencies"" section?

If not, how would you distinct packages to be installed in a production environment, when adding a node backend?

Cheers, guys, really appreciate this project, it has helped me tremendously in setting up the exact environment I need for my projects.

714,2016-06-21 16:50:31,"Hi, i think is more about concept than about actual use, off course you can put `@angular` dependencies in dev since most users just install in production by uploading the bundled files and installing the server deps.

The concept i talk is that devDeps are the deps you need during development (mostly webpack, browserify, gulp...) and in normal deps goes the ones your app really use (like @angular/core) so it's about stating in the package that deps are the ones your app requires and devDeps are the ones you use to bundle, compile or deploy your app.

If you need data from server best approach to use Http service from '@angular/http'. Because it has required change detection code.

But if you really need to use async code that located outside of angular app, you need to wrap it with [NgZone.run(yourCode)](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/NgZone-class.html#!#run-anchor) or finalize it with [ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges()](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/ChangeDetectorRef-class.html#!#detectChanges-anchor)

668,2016-07-10 17:08:54,"hi,

I'm very interested in this topic. Any progress ?
I'm currently trying to write my own components and publish to NPM. As long as my components only include typescript code and HTML templates it's working fine. 
But when I need my components to include a css (or scss) file by means of ""styleUrls"" attribute in @component decorator then it's not working. Same thing if I have, in my component, some png which I want to use either in HTML or css.
I checked that everything is correctly published in my component but starter doesn't seem to care about it.

Anyone tried this (and succeeded ;-)) ? any help, pointer to some similar issue would be appreciated ! I can provide the component I wrote for testing purpose and also my fork of the starter (everything is on github).

Thanks

  Im requesting a feature
- **What is the current behavior?**
  Im having issues deploying my app with this framework to heroku. The container memory will max out and my port will not bind in time causing the app to crash. I believe it may be trying to run the dev environtment, but I believe it should be running production.

  It would be nice to have a quick guide about deploying this to a server since it is meant to be a starter pack and I would guess that plenty of people here new to working with this stack.

  Better understanding of how to deploy the framework to a remote environment.

629,2016-05-26 23:02:50,"Hi,

With router-deprecated, here is what I was doing for lazy load components : 



and in Webpack ;



I was using [es6-promise-loader](https://github.com/gdi2290/es6-promise-loader) , that can expose this `name`property for webpack

So, everything worked well, I got my lazyloaded comp working, and in a separate named chunk.

But, as you can see, I was using the deprecated router.

Trying to update to new RC1 router, I can't make it working anymore.

I obviously apply the changes (`@Routes` instead of `RouteConfig`, no more route `name`, etc.) but I can't figure out how I can handle the ""missing loader issue"" (there's no more `loader`property in the new router, no?). 

I tried  this : 



but got this error : 

`Error: Uncaught (in promise): No Directive annotation found on component`

and also tried this : 



and now got this error: 

`Uncaught (in promise): No Directive annotation found on [object Object]`

So, can anybody help me to achieve this ? Thanks.

571,2016-05-07 21:06:06,"Hi,

I ran your project and everything works fine. However, when I did a more simplified version of Webpack + Angular2 I got the following problem:

When defining a component with requiring html template like this: 

@Component({
selector: 'test',
template: require('./test.component.html')
})

I get the following error:

Error:(22, 12) TS2345: Argument of type '{ selector: string; template: {}; directives: Type[][]; }' is not assignable to parameter of type '{ selector?: string; inputs?: string[]; outputs?: string[]; properties?: string[]; events?: strin...'.
Types of property 'template' are incompatible.
Type '{}' is not assignable to type 'string'.

I fix it by using: 
@Component({
selector: 'test',
template: """" + require('./test.component.html') + """"
})

In your project you have home.component.ts configured like this and it works without warning.

How did you solve this issue as it works perfectly without warning in your project? 

Thanks

472,2016-04-01 13:38:47,"I was going to open an issue relating to path location strategy, but it might be more appropriate here. Maybe @spawnius can help me out. I'm using path location strategy. On my server, nginx is handling incoming requests and sending them off to either the front-end server or the backend (api) server. I can't get non-root routes to work on refresh without specifying all routes like the `location /about` block below: 



If I remove the `location /about` block, then the `/about` route can not be directly accessed. If I visit `/` and navigate to `/about`, all will be fine, but on a refresh I'll get a 404 in the server logs. With the block, however, refreshes work as expected. Also, I don't understand how dynamic uri's (e.g. `/users/3`) can work out between nginx and path location strategy.

Any ideas?

215,2016-02-24 17:08:25,"So I set this up without postcss, but what is the proper way to pull in scss files into my components?

In my component:
`@Component({
  selector: 'about',
  templateUrl: 'app/components/about/about.html',
  styles: [require('./about.scss')],
  providers: [Mockable],
  directives: [MockableList, ROUTER_DIRECTIVES],
  pipes: []
})
`

In my webpack.config.js in loaders array:
`{ test: /\.scss$/, loaders: ['style', 'css', 'sass'] },`

I am getting an error 

> EXCEPTION: TypeError: s.replace is not a function

So I tried to change the loader to this:
`{ test: /\.scss$/, loader: 'raw-loader!sass-loader' },`

Which got rid of the error, but my css is rendered with encapsulation and looks like my component is not encapsulated:
`body.test[_ngcontent-gpk-3] {
  background: red; }
  body.test[_ngcontent-gpk-3] h3[_ngcontent-gpk-3] {
    color: #FFF; }
  body.test[_ngcontent-gpk-3] a[_ngcontent-gpk-3] {
    color: #FFF; }`

So what would be the best way to have a ""global"" scss stylesheet, and then use component scss stylesheets together? I think I have gotten the global part, by turning off viewEncapsulation on the root app, but then do I need to turn it on for every single component inside the app to get the styles to work properly?

I guess basically I am asking how to overwrite the css for the body tag from a component stylesheet.

- I changed my webpack configuration to handle sccs files,
- I created an index.scss file in assets to import ng2-material:



So far it's working good, but I want to use ng-material scss variables in my components styles.

I changed the Home component to use a home.scss file instead of the original css one: `styles: [ require('./home.scss') ]`.

When I use external variables in home.scss, I get `Undefined variable` errors. 
If I import ng2-material sccs into my home.scss (`@import ""node_modules/ng2-material/source/all"";`) I get a `Module build failed: $result: map_merge($result, ...` error.

I can't figure out how to declare scss variables that could be used in all components scss files.

@valorkin I had already installed `moment` via tsd.

What I had to do was the following.

**1. Reference the `tsd.d.ts` generated by `tsd` in `src/typings/_custom.d.ts`.**



Not sure that's the right place, but it definitely worked and looks clean to me.

**2. Moving the tsd typings to `src/typings` for more consistency**

Obviously this is not needed, but I found it more intuitive to have a single app-wide `typings` folder. For doing so I added a `tsd.json` ([src here](https://github.com/juristr/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/simple-component/tsd.json)). Maybe we should include this in this starter by default? What's your view on this @gdi2290 ? or does it interfere with your plans from issue #122 ?

**3. Change the `moment` import as suggested by @valorkin**

It now looks like this:



TypeScript autocompletion now works as expected

Someone still has to explain me why I don't need any ""path"" in the import for moment while I need it for angular2. Is it 'cause `moment` is somehow ""global""?? Otherwise I'll find it out :wink:

Subject: Re: [AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter] how to use sass files (#136)


I followed the exact steps outlined in the Wiki entry (https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/wiki/How-to-include-SCSS-in-components) and I just get an error like the compiler is trying to reading comments like they're CSS:

ERROR in ./src/styles/styles.scss
Module build failed:
/* this file will be extracted to main dist folder and is imported in index.html */
^
      Invalid CSS after ""...load the styles"": expected 1 selector or at-rule, was ""var content = requi""
      in /Users/stephen/repos/chanel-elevator-web/src/ipad/src/styles/styles.scss (line 1, column 1)

 @ ./src/app/index.ts
 @ ./src/main.browser.ts
 @ multi (webpack)-dev-server/client?http://localhost:3000 ./src/main.browser.ts


I'm trying to apply this globally, so my app.component.ts looks like this: (extract)

@Component({
  selector: 'app',
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,
  styleUrls: [
    '../styles/styles.scss'
  ],


Am I doing something wrong?

135,2015-11-25 20:24:30,"While Angular2 itself is said to support IE (9,10,11), I'm having difficulty running this project on IE. I'm getting the following errors:



It's probably an issue with es6-shim.js/webpack but I can't figure it out. I can get [ng2-play](https://github.com/pkozlowski-opensource/ng2-play) to start up fine in IE, so it must be something to do with the way this particular project is set up. Any ideas @gdi2290 ?

127,2015-11-08 18:25:18,"This PR adds `ng2-bootstrap` (as requested in https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter/pull/83). `ng2-bootstrap` provides the ng2 components, `bootstrap` is purely used for the CSS file. The latter could be replaced with a CDN version, but I prefer to be able to work offline which is why I added also the `bootstrap` dependency.

To make things work, I had to [remove the `/node_modules/` regex](https://github.com/dotcs/angular2-webpack-starter/commit/f6a520138588300f27d6b1042f3d534117c23749#diff-11e9f7f953edc64ba14b0cc350ae7b9dL131) in webpack's typescript module loader definition. I tried to only include the `ng2-bootstrap` module - without success. The regex `node_modules\/((?!(ng2-bootstrap)).)*` did not work, although it should exclude all but the `ng2-bootstrap` folder. If the exclusion of `node_modules` is necessary for any other parts of this project, we should find a way around this issue before merging.

118,2015-10-28 20:21:10,"@gdi2290 What is the recommended approach to use the examples? If the idea is to copy&paste the code to the `src` folder, @zarkosusnjar's PR should be accepted (and we should check all other imports in the examples, too). I thought that the main idea is to switch examples via webpack config as described in my post above. But reading example's README sounds like the recommended approach is more or less to copy&paste the code ...

We could also use webpack to resolve the examples automatically by adding the examples folder to the resolved variables like it's done [here](https://github.com/angular-class/angular2-webpack-starter/blob/master/webpack.config.js#L97) for 'rx'. Then we could always write `import {Home} from 'examples/simple-component/home/home';` regardless of where the file that needs the import is located at. It's a matter of taste, so which way do you prefer?

84,2015-10-28 19:25:38,"For me the current setup works with node 4.2.1 and npm 2.14.7 on Mac OS X 10.10. @gsans, @byleaf Can you update node and npm and give us an update if everything works fine now?

If the dependencies have been installed with node 0.x and later node 4.x is being used to update the packages, this might indeed be a problem that leads to an inconsistent state. The easiest solution here is to delete `node_modules` as mentioned above and re-install dependencies using the latest npm.

The PR should fix #16 and #61.

Please note, that it was necessary to include a modified version of the jQuery description (`jquery.d.ts`) to make this work with the rest of the setup.

49,2015-08-04 20:54:27,"@gdi2290 , with regards to our discussion on gitter, Can you help me establish the following workflow using this project structure?  

Deployment
- Deploy 1 or more bundles to CDN
- Deploy index.html and config.json to server.

Bundles are packaged dependencies:
- Typescript with classes and imports transpiled to ES5, minified and obfuscated.
- LESS with @imports transpiled to CSS and minified
- vendor minified js and css.
- images (png,gif,jpg…) minified.
- fonts and svg

Build conditional resources:
-    if(MOCKS) then load local mock service definitions (using E2E_Mock ) and json mock data files

Server configuration file (config.json)     
- Compile config.json file for target server
  - modify target service urls specific to deployment server.
    - Compile to a tmp folder for access during local testing.
    - copy to dist folder on production build.
  - how to load asynchronously outside of the bundle.

Dev Workflow:
- compile config.json to temp folder
- start webpack-dev-server
- load app in browser
- On change to ts or less files
  - Run lint on source file
  - re-transpile that file and reload into dev-server cache
  - include sourcemaps for debugging

Ready to commit:
- Run karma tests against PhantomJS with code coverage ( Istanbul? 
  - If failure use karma against chrome to debug using webstorm xdebug remote.
- run plato reports with linting for ts and less.
- Package for deployment
- run protractor tests against dist bundles

Package for Deployment:
- Build distribution bundle with cache busting and asset minification
- copy index.html to dist folder
- compile config.json for staging and production.
  - Deployment to server should use the same bundle but specific config.json.

@Blackbaud-DanHamlinhttps://github.com/Blackbaud-DanHamlin could you delete node_modules/ and install it again. In the meantime you can use the express server with npm run express but make sure you install the deps first with npm run express-install
