Actually, I have thought of this last night and saw a lot of Awesome List available which can be combined in one app. 

Because the new Apple Guidelines is suggesting that if you're just making the same app and just changing its content, it's better to create one app. 

> Apple Review Guidelines 4.3 
> Don’t create multiple Bundle IDs of the same app. If your app has different versions for specific locations, sports teams, universities, etc., consider submitting a single app and provide the variations using in-app purchase. 

The only thing about Awesome is that the list should be curated, while open source iOS is pulling all the possible open source iOS app available. 

Overall, I've research possible design styles that would best suit the app. :)

This is an extension of a suggestions made in #387.

The idea is that instead of just generating a README for this repository that has a formatted list of all of the OS Apps, a webpage on this project's Github Pages branch is created to display the apps. With the added flexibility of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, people will be able to interact with our content like never before. Filters, searches, expandable content, video demonstrations, better theming, you name it!

Obviously none of this will happen without work, so here is a very basic summary of what needs to be done:
- [x] Language flags
- [x] Theme switching (just swap the bootstrap stylesheets)
- [x] Improve tooltip display
- [x] Persistent settings
- [x] Screenshots
- [x] Parse markdown links
- [x] Fix internal links scrolling too far
- [x] Splash screen with loading bar
- [x] Fix links to users in ""suggested by""
- [x] Background refresh
- [ ] Manual refresh
- [ ] Search
- [ ] Filtering
- [ ] Logo (see #413)
- [ ] Handle links in app descriptions
- [ ] Improve accessibility
- [ ] Sort order option
- [ ] Optimization
- [ ] Improve content (more tags, homepages, screenshots, etc. in the contents.json file)
- [ ] Filter out archived items
- [ ] Load projects for a particular `tag` (see #421)
- [ ] Screenshot thumbnails
- [ ] Refactor JS code
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Compress contents.json

If anyone with UX experience is reading this, we would love your help. I can help with the programming and content portions later this month.

@dkhamsing What is your position on this? Feel free to make improvements.

@scribblemaniac looks like the links we have for XPilot are down, can you find alternate links ?
