note: `objc` is inserted in absence of any `tags`

Issues
1. There are probably exceptions where this doesn't work (seems to work best using a framework / library / api)
2. Communicate this in contributing guidelines

Next
- Make these tags links so that a user can browse all [`firebase`]() projects, etc... most likely generated on the [website](http://dkhamsing.github.io/open-source-ios-apps/) in `gh-pages`
- Add `description`, `link` to tags.. almost like `categories`, so we can have a tag called `forecast api` and it can link to http://forecast.io/

I am not sure of this either. From what I understand, if the logo could suggest that we are affiliated with the company, or cause confusion between us and the company we are basing it off of, then it could definitely be an issue.

I'll make a few more suggestions when I feel up to it.

This is an extension of a suggestions made in #387.

The idea is that instead of just generating a README for this repository that has a formatted list of all of the OS Apps, a webpage on this project's Github Pages branch is created to display the apps. With the added flexibility of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, people will be able to interact with our content like never before. Filters, searches, expandable content, video demonstrations, better theming, you name it!

Obviously none of this will happen without work, so here is a very basic summary of what needs to be done:
- [x] Language flags
- [x] Theme switching (just swap the bootstrap stylesheets)
- [x] Improve tooltip display
- [x] Persistent settings
- [x] Screenshots
- [x] Parse markdown links
- [x] Fix internal links scrolling too far
- [x] Splash screen with loading bar
- [x] Fix links to users in ""suggested by""
- [x] Background refresh
- [ ] Manual refresh
- [ ] Search
- [ ] Filtering
- [ ] Logo (see #413)
- [ ] Handle links in app descriptions
- [ ] Improve accessibility
- [ ] Sort order option
- [ ] Optimization
- [ ] Improve content (more tags, homepages, screenshots, etc. in the contents.json file)
- [ ] Filter out archived items
- [ ] Load projects for a particular `tag` (see #421)
- [ ] Screenshot thumbnails
- [ ] Refactor JS code
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Compress contents.json

If anyone with UX experience is reading this, we would love your help. I can help with the programming and content portions later this month.

@dkhamsing What is your position on this? Feel free to make improvements.

We would either have to find some alternative to the JSON Schema or abandon that kind of validation altogether.

392,2016-07-31 20:26:49,"It may be nice to have a way to include other languages in our repository. Of course people can just replace all of the English with another language if they want to translate, but it might be nice to set up a better standard for this so that multiple languages can be added, especially now that we are looking at more dynamic options (mobile app, webpage) that could allow the user to switch languages. Additionally, there some fields that are the same for all languages so duplicating the file for every language is a bit of a waste of space.

I would love to hear other people's thoughts on how this should be implemented. So far I am thinking that we should handle translations with a standard translation format (XLIFF, TS, or something like that), and then integrate an existing parsing library into our programs. The advantage of this is that it follows an existing standard and will be easier for people to translate since there are already graphical tools to help people translate with those formats. The disadvantage is that it is a completely different format than the main content. Alternatively we could add ids to all the items (something simple like lowercase title with dashes for spaces so we can completely automate that) and then there could be <language>.json files that follow the same structure as the main file, but only specify the id, and any fields that need to be overridden for translation. The advantage of this is the familiar format, and probably compactness. Examples:

Original

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

XLIFF (sorta)

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

JSON file (fr-CA.json)

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Would be an interesting project

I would prefer if we can keep contents.json as the base of the English README

Is there a way of doing this by only adding ""id"" for the entries that are translated 
",dkhamsing,2016-09-09 14:53:34
392,2016-08-01 08:19:49,"> Is there a way of doing this by only adding ""id"" for the entries that are translated

Sure. In fact, the id can be implied for most cases. For example we could specify the id as a lowercase version of the title, with a dash instead of spaces. Then the only circumstances where you would actually need to specify is when the title is changed, or maybe if it contains special characters. The rest of the time, the programs can generate the id when needed from the title.

334,2016-07-13 08:51:58,"@dkhamsing what do you think to improve the AwesomeSwift app in order to get data from both the two JSON, we already share format so we can easily reach that goal with a sort of swiss army knife app for devs.

@michieriffic if you want you can have a look at this already existing (and open sourced) app that we use in [AwesomeSwift](https://github.com/matteocrippa/awesome-swift) - https://github.com/matteocrippa/awesomeSwift-iOS-App
",matteocrippa,2016-07-25 18:17:58
334,2016-07-13 12:01:52,"Forking or using @matteocrippa's app could be a starting point 
",dkhamsing,2016-07-25 18:17:58
334,2016-07-13 12:38:59,"or we can create a branch on that proj 
",matteocrippa,2016-07-25 18:17:58
334,2016-07-13 20:22:03,"@dkhamsing I think what @matteocrippa is suggesting is to combine both Awesome Swift and Open Source iOS as one app as it complements each other. Am I correct? 

Actually, I have thought of this last night and saw a lot of Awesome List available which can be combined in one app. 

Because the new Apple Guidelines is suggesting that if you're just making the same app and just changing its content, it's better to create one app. 

> Apple Review Guidelines 4.3 
> Don’t create multiple Bundle IDs of the same app. If your app has different versions for specific locations, sports teams, universities, etc., consider submitting a single app and provide the variations using in-app purchase. 

The only thing about Awesome is that the list should be curated, while open source iOS is pulling all the possible open source iOS app available. 

Overall, I've research possible design styles that would best suit the app. :)
",michieriffic,2016-07-25 18:17:58
334,2016-07-13 20:32:58,"combine or fork / create different app is fine by me, end goal is to have an app :-)
",dkhamsing,2016-07-25 18:17:58
334,2016-07-13 20:55:45,"I was only wondering that combining would be faster, we have only to find a name that fits back both the two lists and polish a little features keeping the repo public
",matteocrippa,2016-07-25 18:17:58
334,2016-07-13 21:41:40,"Yes seems that would be faster

334,2016-07-17 22:46:05,"@matteocrippa i'll try to make a version of my app first and see what I can integrate in from your app. I've seen your repo and you are using LeeGo for the UI and I prefer using the storyboard or doing the UI using Apple's Framework. :) 

@dkhamsing are you ok with that? :)
",michieriffic,2016-07-25 18:17:58
334,2016-07-17 23:29:11,"Yeah it's fine

334,2016-07-18 05:55:45,"@michieriffic if you can wait a couple of days I'll push a new version of the app in a separate branch that strip off the POC of LeeGo, making use of Storyboard and XIBs for max reusability and faster UI development.
If you want in the meanwhile feel free to share a mockup of the idea so we can work in order to review that first and figure out how to implement.

In order to avoid merge issues, I strongly suggest to keep the storyboard as simple as possibile, but make use of XIBs

# notes
- categories only support two levels 
-   categories are in order listed in json file
-    adding repos always at the end will cause conflicts ... 😕  
## meta.json

would it be better to have contents.json split up ?
- contents.json: title, description, source, itunes, category
- meta.json: rest of info (screenshots, license, homepage, etc..)

so contents.json can be smaller..

readme generation would need to use both json files though

json-spec is not particularly verbose, so I would recommend putting the schema.json and data.json files into [JSON Schema Lint](http://jsonschemalint.com/draft4/). It shows a snippet from the section where the error occurs which makes things a lot easier to debug than giving the array index.

275,2016-05-11 04:05:14,"> rename lang, use country codes (jp for japan, es for spain etc)

Is this really a good idea? This idea occurred to me as well when building the converter, because some information will inevitably be lost if we use languages. For example on one of them, Brazilian becomes Portuguese. But for example, just pick a random english project and ask, ""What country is that from?"" Likely you won't be able to tell, it could be UK, US, Canada, Australia, Guyana, etc. Even for one in Chinese, how can you distinguish that from someone who just likes to show off their Google Translate skills? I came to the conclusion that a country code feels misleading. What are your thoughts on this?

`lang` will indicate the primary language of the project, and maybe a new `country` attribute where the location is known. A string value with [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) perhaps?

267,2016-05-07 03:36:04,"I think that having the readme generated is an excellent idea! It allows the end format to easily be changed and allows for easier reading by programs.

Here is my proposal for a JSON structure, using the v2ex app as an example:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

There are two main types of objects here, the category object, which goes under categories, and the app object, which goes under apps. Here's the structure I was thinking of for each of them:

**Category object**
Required attributes: `title`, `id`
Optional attributes, with default value in parentheses: `description` (`""""`)

**App object**
Required attributes: `title`, `category`, `description`, `source`
Optional attributes, with default value in parentheses: `lang` (`""eng""`), `homepage` (`null`), `itunes` (`null`), `stars` (`null`), `tags` (`[]`)
Notes:
- The tags attribute is for extra metadata for the app. For example a swift app would have `tags: [""swift""]`
- The lang attribute should be a [ISO 639-2 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes).

Let me know what you think, what you like and don't like. If you finalize a format, and it is easily parsable (JSON, XML, etc.), I will help convert the existing information to the new format. :smile:

_EDIT_: I just noticed that there are sometime subcategories such as Hacker News. For that I would suggest adding a `parent` attribute to the category object. Ex:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>
",scribblemaniac,2016-05-11 16:00:56
267,2016-05-07 13:11:37,"Thanks for your proposal

It looks pretty good

Another repo considering this is https://github.com/matteocrippa/awesome-swift so it would be great if the format was compatible or generic. Maybe it can say projects instead of apps

Would you write a script to convert the markdown?

For those of you who are curious, this is the script I used to convert the markdown to JSON. It handles most cases, and just throws warnings for the rare edge cases so they can easily be fixed manually.
