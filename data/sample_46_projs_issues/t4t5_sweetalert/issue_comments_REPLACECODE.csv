Take a look in https://github.com/limonte/sweetalert2 it has reversed buttons order by default. Also, there's the reverseButtons parameter so you can always configure the order of buttons.

In the case that the user double-clicks (by mistake) and closes the alert immediately after having opened it, they will trigger whatever action the alert entails (the callback), without having read the warning/explanation/consequences that may have been mentioned in the alert.

The way things are right now – nothing happens on the misclick, other than the alert closing – the user will have to click the action button again (that opens the alert) and will hopefully that time not misclick and read the message.

**Current solution**: Smart (or coincidental?) UI/UX that handles misclicks, and ensures the user has always had the chance of reading the information carried in the sweetAlert.  
**This PR**: Makes things easier for testing, and easier for developers to understand. However it may be slightly worse UI/UX as users will never see the alert (and the information in it) when misclicking.  
**Third solution**: Only handle misclicks for Confirm-alerts, where the user can actually take a ""wrong"" action by misclicking.",malthejorgensen,

That is the expected behavior of `setDefaults`. If you set the `setDefaults` property, it'll apply to all of your SweetAlerts, regardless if it's the shorthand or longhand versions.

From the documentation:

I'm working in a Vue.js application. I'm using Vue Resource to consume API data generated in a PHP backend. When validation errors occur, i receive those errors in the error call back, which are iterated, formatted and passed to the ""text"" option of the Sweet Alert Object. Whenever each error is fixed by the user, He again submits the form and a new ajax call is made. The call back now registers an array with errors, but obviously omitting  the last one fixed. The response from the server is Ok, however, Sweet Alert continues showing the same error data, from the previous call, including the fixed error. This is the code from the ajax call and the Sweet Alert Use:

But, there is a flaw in the code and it checks the number of arguments in a very hack-ish way by trying to parse the callback as a string. This method fails if you change the context of the callback using bind such as swal({...}, function(reason){}.bind(someContext))   The code should be updated to use the .length property of the callback:

If there are any good candidates to help med maintain the project, please let me know!

I have one suggestion, you create a new type of alert. Like input but with <select> and <option>, and then having a options when you can put the options ""value,text,value,text,...""
Something like this:
type: ""select"",
options: ""1,Some Text,2,Another Text""

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

When ever i close the modal too early, before the little error cross icon animation, the callback never fires. this most likely is because the callback function is called on a button click event which is bound after a non-async animation call, and not on the dialog teardown.
# 

As a small node, I handle this now by binding a setInterval that checks if the .sweetalert element has the class hideSweetAlert, which then fires the callback, instead of relying on the callback of swal.
",hellsan631,

I have a ""Delete"" button which fires a confirm dialog using swal. The swal confirm button takes the same place as the ""Delete"" button behind it, making it easy to click on it before swal animation is completed.

When this occur, the confirm callback is not fired. In my case, swal's own animation is blocking the callback when it has not yet finished.
",chekovsky,
528,2016-02-18 21:16:53,"In my case as well, it looks like the animation is whats blocking the callback. Most likely the animation fires syncronously (it should ideally be bound to a requestAnimationFrame imo)

Also, the callback never fires when you hit the esc key. To remedy both situations, here is some rancid code.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

_Here is a use case_

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

It calls the callback function on the esc key down and also if the class 'hideSweetAlert' is on the sweet alert container div. Its not optimal, but it works.

508,2016-01-08 08:04:00,"Hi!,

I am using sweet alert for displaying a confirmation selector to toggle a modal window with a chart on it. The thing is that I've been able to do this but with the responsive option set to true on the chart, you have to resize the browser window in order to actually see the graph, if you set this to false then the behaviour is fine, at least until you resize the browser (with the responsive flag set to false it gets crazy..)

Finally I've been able to do this by trigger the:

$('#tempModalDay').on('shown.bs.modal', function (event) { }

But now I don't know how to link the sweet alert confimation button with $('#tempModalDay').on('shown.bs.modal', function (event) {}

Any ideas?

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

swal({
                        title: ""¿Deseas ver los datos para este día?"",
                        text: 'Pulsa aceptar para confirmar',
                        type: ""info"",
                        showCancelButton: true,
                        closeOnConfirm: false,
                        confirmButtonColor: ""#1ab394"",
                        confirmButtonText: '<a data-taget=""tempModalDay"">Aceptar</a>',
                        html: true,

the second alert is shown but immediately closed, probably due to the fact that the closure of the first alert causes the closure of the second one.

Example of code:
swal({ title: 'first' }, function(){ swal('second') });

We cannot use the  {closeOnConfirm: false} option since when we call the first sweetalert in the way reported in the example we are not sure that we will have another sweetalert call on the callback.

Its because of the way you check for parameters, seems like bind adds another one
",luisgarciaalanis,
480,2016-03-21 13:12:09,"The issue is in this code.
  // Check if callback function expects a parameter (to track cancel actions)
  var functionAsStr = String(params.doneFunction).replace(/\s/g, '');
  var functionHandlesCancel = functionAsStr.substring(0, 9) === 'function(' && functionAsStr.substring(9, 10) !== ')';

When you bind a function it returns a new instance of a function, which doesn't explicitly specify a param.

example : 
String(window.alert.bind(this, 'test'))
""function () { [native code] }""

// Straight function declaration
String(function(test){});
""function (test){}""

It appears that they are trying to only fire the handler if the function passed as the callback specifies the incoming property for isConfirm.  This seems like a bit of bad practice. The callback should always fire if its specified, it should be up to the user to check that value to ensure it was confirmed.

If you click ""too fast"" on the ""Confirm"" button, the page just get's stuck, and get non-responsive, and the next few Confirms don't show.

I bypassed this slightly, by adding a delay to the SWAL call, but if you click faster than the delay, it'll break again.

I'm working on an Ember application that uses sweetalert, and it works great! But testing with these alerts becomes problematic. By default Ember applications are appended to the body:

Since sweetalert appends to the body, my ember application does not register any click events on the alert in test mode which means it's impossible to test.

I know this should be a pull request. But I wanted to add the wrapper I wrote here anyway so I can get feedback if this is a useful addition.

This usage here is that anywhere in your application you can call `swalService.swal()` and if there are open sweet alerts, it will queue them and put a notification on the current sweet alert that there is a pending alert. The swal method will return a unique identifier so you can call close on a specific sweet alert even if its is pending.

",kentmw,
457,2015-11-19 15:50:42,"# SwalService

Here is the code with only jquery as a project dependencies other than sweetalert:

## The Code

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Bring this code in anyway you want after sweetalert - if you are using browserify, just add

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

at the bottom of the file.

## Initialize

Once it is on the page, initialize the service:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Note: it has not been tested with multiple instances on the same page. For most uses a singleton is what you want anyway.

## Create As Usual

To create a sweet alert, use the service's swal method exactly like you would use the original swal method from sweetalert.

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Go ahead, and try it by copying the service code into the console on http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/
But now, if you fire another swal afterwards, instead of overriding it, the new swal will be pending and a message shows up.

## Close

You can close the current swal through the UI or programatically using `swalService.close()`.  It will close the current swal and open the next swal after a brief (400ms) delay for the animation of closing to finish. Because the swalService's swal method returns a unique id handle, you can close specific swals (not just the current one) by using `swalService.close(swalHandleId)` even if the swal to target is pending. This is also useful if you have a swal that you don't want the user to close like an indication of loading/pending that doesn't have a close button yet the developer can close it programatically.

Please note that when you have a callback added to you alert that should be invoked upon close, this callback will be automatically invoked if the user initiates the close. But if you wish to invoke this callback while closing the alert programatically, call:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I believe this can be handled automatically without the need for a separate method (besides .close), but I haven't refactored it yet.

## Is Open

The service also has a bit more to the API. You can call `swalService.isSwalOpen()` to see if there is currently a swal open. 

## Pending Alert Message

A message about the number of pending swals will appear on the current swal as they queue. You can style this by adding css that targets a span with class ""other-messages"". 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

You can also turn off the pending messages altogether by initiailizing the service with:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Obviously, the state this service is does not support i18n (multilingual audiances), you'll have to override the `refreshPendingText()` method for that.

## Catches

If you don't create a swal correctly, like missing title for instance, the swalService will still think there is a alert open though the base swal library never created one. Be careful to fully construct you alerts.

",QuakePhil,
457,2016-03-18 17:47:27,"@kentmw you are awesome man!! Thanks a lot!!

Your wrapper saved my ass. A few notes. As @QuakePhil mentioned there is an issue if there are multiple alerts in the queue, each with nested responses for confirm/cancel.

In order to deal with this I am closing the parent swal using the ID immediately after the child is created. And in order to pair this Parent (question) - Child(response) scenario, I have made a tiny modification in the wrapper to append all new swals at the beginning of the array/queue and not at the end.

This works with single requests as well. So, consider the following scenario in order to show how the alerts are created:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

And here is how the alerts will be displayed to the user:

I first of all want to congratulate on developing a beautiful and easy to use pop-up script.

For the past week I have tried to use Swal and jquery form validation examples to validate input before submitting a form and I have reached a big brick wall and need to reach out for  help.

I have a swal pop-up on my website (http://plantswap.com.au) that appears when you click on ""Tell a friend"" button. The SWAL componnent works fine, but it submits the form even if I haven't entered any input. Also, I am not sure that anything actually happens on submit. When submit is clicked, a php file is called through AJAX that should send an email. 

Here is the javaScript in my header.php file:

-->

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

</script>

if you test this, you will see the swal pops up but the validation does not work. I even tried using the tramero SWAL addition (swal.forms) but the alignment and horizontal and vertical scroll bars were all wrong, so I gave up on that.

Can you please help me modify the above source code to get the form validation working, as well as follow through on the submit so the parameters are passed to my PHP file via the submit POST?

Thanks in advance.

Kind regards,

Is this really a problem with SweetAlert? Keep in mind that the only recommended way to handle user inputs through swal is by using `type: input`. Everything else with custom HTML should be considered a ""hack"".

If your form submits even though it's empty, I can only guess that the problem lies within the  `myForm.valid()`-function.

And when it comes to ""I am not sure that anything actually happens on submit. When submit is clicked, a php file is called through AJAX that should send an email"", well, you should be able to just log your stuff in the PHP console to check if it went through or not. Can't really help you anymore than this. :)

452,2015-09-28 16:54:06,"I have a page which essentially gives the entire screen over to an iframe.
The page (the parent document, or the top document if you prefer, though there are only two levels - parent and iframe) can use swal just fine.

The iframe tries to use swal and fails. It's hard to describe the error, and I am just guessing that it is because swal is running in an iframe.

It appears that everything swal creates is under the iframe (in terms of z-index). iframe content is pushed up from the bottom of the page just a little.

I've grabbed a screen shot of the bottom of the page in question.
The dark gray section touches the bottom of the page before swal is called.

This is on firefox. If I go into firebug and make the largest div (id=""foundation"") in the iframe display: none, i get the following:

And finally if I manually change the margin-top from its current -73px to 200px on the main sweet-alert div (not sweet-overlay) then I see the following:

![forswal3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9857137/10142295/142d2744-65cf-11e5-88ea-eace7c1320e6.png)

I'm open to suggestion. The tool looks fun and very useful. I'd love to get away from alert or hand-coded overlay layers.

p.s. - forgot to give the call. I had been using various others but settled on one out of the examples:
swal({
  title: ""Error!"",
  text: ""Here's my error message!"",
  confirmButtonText: ""Cool""
});

p.p.s. - I tried a little work-around pending input from author or contributor - at the invocation in the sweetalert-dev.js file, I changed 'document' to 'parent.document ? parent.document : document' which seems to have done the trick.

Would this be an acceptable approach? What say you?

In my case we track frontend errors with angular and stacktrace.js. We give every function a name to make debugging easier.

If the function is named, the `functionAsString` contains something like `functioncallback(isConfirm)`.

This would obviously be hidden by default thanks to the SweetAlert CSS. Then you can open it by passing a jQuery element or a DOM node to the swal-function:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

The idea is that as long as you follow some conventions when writing your HTML, you get the SweetAlert-functionality for free.

I think it would solve a lot of problems that people have with ""over-customizing"", like adding a third button, implementing a form... etc.

409,2015-08-15 10:33:17,"@t4t5 I think that having the markup and the parameters (via the data-\* attributes) of the modal in the html would be really cool.
Then to open an alert you would have to pass the alert id to the `swal()` function.

Example:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Would add a cancel button then show the modal by adding it the class ""current-sweetalert-modal"" (to avoid collision with others current classes that the user could have in it's `CSS`.
",SkyzohKey,
409,2015-08-27 05:44:12,"I'm averse to the idea of introducing a special `div` in your code that defines the contents of your sweetalert in your HTML. Among other things, it'll:
- Mix style and control flow, which should be entirely separate. If I'm using Javascript, I should be able to accomplish what I want _in Javascript_. SweetAlert's main draw is that, at the moment, it functions like a pure JS solution - mixing with HTML is to me an ugly way to proceed, and detracts from its appeal.
- Requires a lot of manual effort. If I have a lot of SweetAlert messages, that's a lot of cruft code I'll have to write manually or generate somehow - neither of which make for clean injections. 

In my opinion, a much better solution would be to do it like React.js does: allow user-defined **types** and **templates** in Javascript for the SweetAlert message. You already have support for types, except that they are very limited - you have `input`,`success`,`error` and `warning`, each of which has its own look and feel. Here, each user-defined type would let you employ a template - HTML/CSS snippets with some blank or filler spaces you can fill in using a JS object. 

As a rough example of how it might work, the new types and templates might do a number of things:
- Let you define _keys_ that correspond to certain values in your template. e.g. if we have a template defined by `<input type =  {this.input_type}>`, then one could do `swal('title': 'Hello', type='user-defined', input_type = 'file')` and have the SweetAlert render with an input box configured to accept files in place of text, with all other customisations intact. (This is also a great way to avoid XSS attacks, since you can't arbitrarily inject HTML anymore!)
- Let you define how to _handle_ your input. For instance, in the context of this issue, a user could specify that all text be handled as `<div>{this.text}</div>` instead of `<p>{this.text}</p>` as is currently being done.
- Let you define templates for _different sections_ of a sweet alert. You could define a template for the title, a template for buttons, etc.
- Let you define different _actions_ e.g. instead of just slide-up or slide-down, somebody could define their own action/transition for the SweetAlert.

The bottom line is that you can achieve a pure JS solution with support against XSS and more powerful customisation tools without resorting to HTML and additional data attributes as a crutch. 

What do you think? 
",AkshatM,
409,2015-08-27 06:27:52,"I was thinking about the XSS problem today. This is clearly a solution to that, and goes well beyond.

I think from the issues it's clear that sweetalert is being used as a modal, so it may as well be done right. I like this idea.

",samhavens,
409,2015-08-27 07:47:48,"We could recommend/use a [client-side templating engine](http://garann.github.io/template-chooser/) to structure it all. I personally favour React.js because it supports type validation out of the box when you pass in properties to a component, but of course anything else could work. 

I think the only problem with this solution might be that this would require a significant rewrite. Specifically, `sweetalert-dev.js` has a `switch` statement with an object case that simply updates the default params, rather than let you define your own. Like @t4t5 mentions, there is only one SweetAlert box that keeps getting updated each time. We need a way to 'subclass' objects - to have a base `SweetAlert` object that simply checks the `type` argument supplied, and then calls the template involved. 

One way to do this - and the one I think would be most painless, given how extensive SweetAlert is - would be to have a function called `registerTemplate()`, which registers a template in a store accessible to `swal`. `swal` would then check the `type` argument on being invoked against an internal list -`success`,`input`,`error`,`warning` - and, if not found, default to passing all other arguments to the template and somehow render it. I think `_sweetAlertInitialize$getModal$getOverlay$getInput$setFocusStyle$openModal$resetInput$fixVerticalPosition` might be able to handle the rendering, although I'd have to take a closer look at it, I'm not sure.

391,2016-11-02 02:46:29,"This bug still exists.  You can even see it on the main sweetalert demo page... http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/

Simply click the Try Me button for the AJAX example and then notice that tab no longer works.  I can see in the debugger that window.onfocus is not being restored to null afterwords.  If I manually set it then I can use tab again.  But setting it to null in the callback function passed to swal() does NOT work for me.  I set it to null there, but something else internal to Sweetalert is setting it back before the whole process ends.  Breaking into the debugger several seconds later confirms this.

Please fix!

343,2015-04-28 14:39:43,"In my opinion, sweetalert.css may not include the default theme, but just CSS for show/hide behaviour.

With the current setup, we have to redefine all the swal theme to the website's theme, or add classes and !important tags to our CSS properties to override default behaviour, and this is not a good thing.

In my opinion, that would be a better set-up :
- sweetalert.css : behaviour, show/hide
- themes/default.css : default theme (defining colors, borders, etc.)

That way, Sweet Altert would be by-default website adapted (using font style, buttons styles, etc.).
",tmos,
343,2015-04-28 14:50:58,"Hm, that's a tough choice. I understand the idea, but at the same time I think the library should be as ""plug-and-play"" as possible. Forcing users to include three separate files just to get the basics to work seems overly complicated.

Do you really need that many `!important` tags for your theme? The only thing I've used them for in the alternative themes that come with SweetAlert is the button focus, and that's because it's a property set via JavaScript (so even splitting up the CSS into multiple files wouldn't fix that).

343,2015-04-28 15:00:47,"In my situation, I have a webiste with a complete theme (including theming for UI items, like raw buttons, inputs, etc.). So I have like a ""kit"", and every new item just adapt to the CSS, that is the more generic as possible.

So to adapt swal to my website, I have to create a full swal theme, copying/pasting my css properties. I'm not very comfortable with duplicating all my UI CSS.

It's true that people would have 3 files to include instead of two, but 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

don't seems ""overly complicated"" compared to 

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

It's true that this choice is important, but I think going in a (subtle) more modular architecture may open swal to more personalization, and so to have better integration on websites with a full graphic identity.
",tmos,
343,2015-04-29 05:10:44,"+1, should definitely not have to redefine tons of styles.

Perhaps a middle ground would be to provide two versions. `/dist/sweetalert.css` could remain the same, but there could also be a `/dist/sweetalert-themeless.css` that just has the structural styling?
",SnidelyWhiplash,
343,2015-04-29 12:13:42,"This may be a good choice, indeed.

If you want to go in this way without having a pain maintaining two CSS files, you may have a look at some CSS post-processors, like (pleeease.io)[pleeease]. It is useful to put multiple CSS files in one in a logical way.

I just wanted to report a bug in the handle-click.js module.
If I use the /dist/sweetalert-dev.js or /dist/sweetalert.min.js it's throwing an error when I close the modal because in your handleConfirm or handleCancel Methods you do `sweetAlert.close();` where sweetAlert is undefined. I think this is because you don't import sweetAlert into the handle-click.js module, so the sweetAlert variable is never defined in the browserify output.
Maybe this is also the case in other modules.

331,2015-04-14 03:53:11,"Hey guys,

I've found that when using `html: true` we can **not** include any input fields or they will be hidden by `sweetalert.css > input{display:none}`.

Sometimes it's interesting to load our own forms within the alert and this is blocking that atm. 
A fix for this would be to give the HTML input element a class and apply the input styling to that class rather than all inputs.

I'm willing to make a pull request if someone can validate this from a functional perspective.
",PommeVerte,
331,2015-07-28 01:58:07,"@PommeVerte ,

The line of CSS you mention is in there, however, if you wrap your input in form tags, and have styling like `form input {display:block}` that should take precedence.

There is another problem putting form fields in using `html: true`, because everything in `text` gets wrapped in `<p>...</p>`, and it is invalid to have form elements inside `p` tags. I fixed this locally by switching the `p` tags for divs. I will fork and submit a pull request; you are welcome to checkout my fork.

304,2015-03-10 11:00:43,"Hi,
I'm using sweet alert to show chained messages during various ajax executions.
I wondered if it would be possible to show a window message without any buttons.
It would be very useful for example to show a temporary waiting message.

Concerning this and other user requests, more in general, I think that adding a new option to let people  add a custom ccs selector class to a window will solve many customization requests.

Thank you very much in advance.

I needed that because I use a CSSLint validator that doesn't allow me to style h2 without class ; but it can help on many other customizations.

277,2015-03-14 17:55:19,"I think it's wrong to add these 2 functionalities just for the sake of some CSSLink validator to be honest. Also, it sounds very weird that you shouldn't be allowed to style an h2 tag without a class. What's the logic behind that exactly? :/
Feature-wise, you can style the tags simply by adding a class to the modal itself, which should be enough.

274,2015-02-05 16:44:29,"I was noticing that using the imageSize parameter appeared to still be broken when I call the following:

swal({   title: ""Sweet!"",   text: ""Here's a custom image."",   imageUrl: ""images/thumbs-up.jpg"" , imageSize: ""80x80""});
[RETURNED] Undefined at SweetAlert.js:557

That led me to dig and determine that this bug was fixed in the latest release. Therefore I tried emptying my cache several different ways (empty cache and hard reload, clear cache from browser history, reset firefox, etc) and reloading the page. No matter what, it still appears to be loading the old version of the javascript. 

If I look at the html for the example page located here http://tristanedwards.me/sweetalert I see this on line 14:  <script src=""/u/SweetAlert/lib/sweet-alert.js""></script>

If I go to that link http://tristanedwards.me/u/SweetAlert/lib/sweet-alert.js you can see that it is the old version of the javascript (check out line 557 and you still see the broken code for imageSize).

Not sure how, but this old version is getting sucked into a meteor package that I am relying on so that too is breaking when I use imageSize.

To replicate:
go to: http://tristanedwards.me/sweetalert
Open javascript console
Enter: swal({   title: ""Sweet!"",   text: ""Here's a custom image."",   imageUrl: ""images/thumbs-up.jpg"" , imageSize: ""80x80""});

Expected response: show sweet alert

**Edit:** As I expected, the problem is with the first sweet alert confirmation. Setting `animation` to false on first swal stops the problem. But it looks like a BUG for me, because I might want the animation enabled in case of the error don't occours.

I propose two solutions:

**1st:** If a second alert is called while an existent alert is being animated off, stop the animation process, close immediately the current alert and show the new one.

**2nd:** Queue the second alert to be opened when the close animation finish.

The 2nd solution should make things smoother, while the 1st solution make the error modal appears faster!

247,2015-01-08 16:10:03,"Hi

I really like your work, but unfortunately it didn't fit exactly my needs, so I decided to fork it and modify it.

Basically what I did was making the confirmbutton optional. As default it's still shown, so for all existing users, nothing will change. If someone feels the need to show a sweetalert box without any button, he/she can pass the showConfirmButton param as false and there you go, the button is gone.

The following question is now, how should we close it? Easy! just call `swal(false);`. If you feel like, you can also give an close function as second parameter like `swal(false, function() { alert('Modal is closing'); });`

I hope you like the modifications.

Cheers Pascal Wacker

P.S. I'm so exited, my first github modification :D

247,2015-01-08 22:49:54,"Hi @limonte nice work (:  

But how can you trigger a close event in your sweetalert2 plugin? In my case, I'd like to show an overlay with a ""well done"" or ""oops..."" message and perform an ajax request in the background. Once the data comes back from the server and is passed to the DOM, the modal should close itself. As I can't predict how long the ajax request will need, I can't use the timer function.

Btw. on line 258 you have an error:  
`params.allowEscapeKey = arguments[0].allowEscapeKey !== undefined ? arguments[0].showConfirmButton : defaultParams.allowEscapeKey;`  

should be:  
`params.allowEscapeKey = arguments[0].allowEscapeKey !== undefined ? arguments[0].allowEscapeKey : defaultParams.allowEscapeKey;`

For a bit of context, I am using Sweet Alerts with the Angular wrapper (https://github.com/oitozero/ngSweetAlert) as part of an Ionic App.

The issue I was having was that in a Sweet Alert with both a Confirm and a Cancel button, such as:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Regardless of whether I hit the confirm or the cancel button, isConfirm would be false. I ended up narrowing the issue down to the fact that while hovering over the confirm button set 
targetedConfirm = (target.className === 'confirm')
When I actually clicked on the confirm button the className changed to 'confirm activated'.
I was able to get around this issue by adding:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

After case(""click"") on line 300 (in the non-minified file), but I feel like this is a bit hacky and was wondering if there is an official solution.

231,2014-12-18 19:46:02,"Im guessing here. If you show us some code, I might be able to hep more.

for sweetAlert to hide, the page needs to refresh. In a Cordova or JQuery when you press back, the page doesn't refresh, it just changes state, so trying putting an event handler on the back-button/page-change using phonegap and hide sweet alert.

IMO the strict escape HTML on params.text is not really neccessary.

`params.confirmButtonText  = (defaultParams.showCancelButton) ? 'Confirm' : defaultParams.confirmButtonText;`
is wrong; it should be this:
`params.confirmButtonText  = (params.showCancelButton) ? 'Confirm' :...` 
because `defaultParams` is always false; you want the user's settings here, so use `params` instead, which is set just above this, in line 225.
Next, in line 259, the code,
`targetedConfirm    = (target.className === ""confirm'';`
is wrong because by the time you press the `Confirm` button, the class is now `confirm activated`, so there are two classes listed, so comparing against the one will fail. Instead, it should be this:
`targetedConfirm    = (target.className.indexOf(""confirm"") !=-1),`
This way, it checks that `confirm` is present in the class list.
And now, the `doneFunction`, with a parameter, works correctly.
Two bugs, two easy fixes!

So, here is the story. I got an error ""Cannot read property 'querySelector' of null"" which I realized that was some known issue and some guys tried to fix it. I found another version of your sweet-alert.js using the following code (I compare them and there are plenty of differences with your original except the following code) .

   _var args = arguments;
    if (getModal() !== null) {
        // If getModal returns values then continue
        modalDependant.apply(this, args);
    } else {
        // If getModal returns null i.e. no matches, then set up a interval event to check the return value until it is not null  
        var modalCheckInterval = setInterval(function() {
          if (getModal() !== null) {
            clearInterval(modalCheckInterval);
            modalDependant.apply(this, args);
          }
      }, 100);
    }_

which actually solve this problem but now the callback functions for example
_closeOnConfirm: false }, **function()**
            { ...}_
doesn't work anymore!

Is there any solution of a js that works fine for everything of the above?

202,2014-11-18 15:12:29,"Hello, guys.
I've discovered a bad thing SweetAlert does. It inserts this code into a body on it's initialization:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

It causes no harm until you try to use SweetAlert within an ajax site. As said in [google ajax crawling specification](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/specification) ajax site should respond with a ""static html"" content if `_escaped_fragment_` request param is presented.
Some services like [prerender](https://prerender.io/) are render ""static html"" with PhantomJS and return snapshot of page after all ajax-magic finished.
So if ajax site uses SweetAlert, it has useless text(with `<h2>` tag!) on each ""page"". Please, check [rendered SweetAlert demo page](http://service.prerender.io/http://tristanedwards.me/sweetalert).
Looks like SweetAlert can spoil ajax site with useless words. Crawler may consider ""title"" to be one of the main site keywords.
There are at least 3 ways to fix this, I think:
1. Do not insert template until `sweetAlert`  or `swal` call
2. Remove dummy text from a template
3. Cut SweetAlert html code on ""static html"" render

I am using sweetalert with ajax requests when the promise gets returned on a login or logout inside a login service. Works like a charm, the timer only starts when the ajax request is finished and depending on the data I get back it changes the content. Of course I don't know anything about your project or goal.

I'm using sweetAlert as a replacement for js confirm() function.
All works fine in production but my selenium tests fail because the callback function on clicking ""OK"" does not get called.

I've noticed this is due to selenium clicking ""OK"" before the sweetalert animation completes.
If I add a sleep() before clicking ""OK"" all works fine.

It would be handy to bind the callback to the ""OK"" / ""CANCEL"" buttons before showing the animation, so that no sleep is required if you need to automate tests of applications using sweetAlert

177,2014-10-30 11:23:12,"I think we should rethink the timer and these kind of requests.. is there anything like that happening with the real alert?! It's not a replacement for everything...

even the timer I think it's a bad idea to have it on the Alert message.. that is blocking everything.. this should not be used either for onloading or closed after a while or not having the confirm button.. or if you need all these things they should be part of something that has alert in the name.. but more of a popup.. 

Alerts are meant to open after some user's actions and user should act upon it.. otherwise you should not alert in such intrusive way!

177,2014-10-30 11:28:48,"I think it's better to consider sweetalert as an improvement of the native alert component, not just a replacement.

If you want to show to your user that an action is successful, you may consider sweetalert `success` with timer and without button. It's kind of a notification.

Otherwise, you have to find another notification plugin, just for this case.

IMO, this is not a pain to handle this case.

I think that the document ready of jquery is triggered before your code at the end of source.

I'm trying to popup a sweet alert on document ready _($(function() {}))_, fetching a message inside the html. The problem is that the **sweetAlertInitialize** function is not called before my **swal()** call, so it try to getModal() without a .sweet-alert element in DOM.

136,2014-10-20 15:00:17,"Actually i made some adjustements.

Here's a small guide : 
First apply the fix in sweet-alert.js on line 695 : 
<code>if (document.readyState === ""complete"" || document.readyState === ""interactive"" && document.body) {</code>

then that should work for IE9 and over.

Next step is to include the file:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

This will make sure there's no errors in IE 8(if you need that, if you don't just include it normally)

Then here's the workaround that should work with IE 7,8,9 and normal.

<pre><code>
function isIE () {
    var myNav = navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase();
    if((myNav.indexOf('msie') != -1)) {
        return parseInt(myNav.split('msie')[1]);

}

    var proxied = swal;
}
var swal = function() {
    if(isIE() == '7' || isIE() == '8') {
        if(typeof arguments[0]['showCancelButton'] == 'boolean') {
            var result = confirm(arguments[0]['title']);
            if(arguments[arguments.length-1] != 0 && typeof arguments[arguments.length-1] == ""function"") {
                arguments[arguments.length-1](result);
            } else {
                return result;
            }
        } else {
            if(typeof arguments[0] == 'string') {
                alert(arguments[0]);
            } else {
                
            }
        }
    } else {
        if(isIE() == '9' && (typeof arguments[0]!='Object')) {
            if(arguments[2]==""success"") {
                var temp = new Array();
                temp['imageUrl']='/images/success.png';
                temp['title']=arguments[0];
                temp['text']=arguments[1];
                arguments[0] = temp;
                arguments[1] = null;
                arguments[2] = null;
            }
            if(arguments[2]==""error"") {
                var temp = new Array();
                temp['imageUrl']='/images/error.png';
                temp['title']=arguments[0];
                temp['text']=arguments[1];

                arguments[1] = null;
                arguments[2] = null;
            }
        }
        return proxied.apply( this, arguments );
    }
};
</code></pre>

Note : you will need your own success.png and error.png
The reason is simple : CSS3 animations just don't work in IE9.

127,2014-10-15 18:40:31,"Hello, 

It seems that when the SweetAlert dialog opens another one after it's done, the tab key stops working, all other keystrokes are okay.

You can recreate this using the example on http://tristanedwards.me/sweetalert.

This one specifically:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

I believe it's copying over the keystroke handling from the previous modal, specifically in the closeModal() function, this part:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Perhaps it's simply focusing on the previous modal and registering back it's keydown and onclick?
",heero-yuy,
127,2014-10-16 15:40:28,"From that example I can't really see that what you are saying is true,
Becaues the 'tab' key is just moving between the buttons,
when I get the second modal I have only one button, so no matter how much you will press the tab button it'll always stay on it's single one button it has.
",littleneotrix,
127,2014-10-16 18:19:19,"Sorry I didn't make that clear! 

Yes it's tabbing IN the model, but after you close the second modal, you lose the ability navigate the web page with the tab key (No modals on screen just the web page). 
",heero-yuy,
127,2014-10-16 22:25:27,"I've attempted a fix at [jack126guy/sweetalert@issue127](https://github.com/jack126guy/sweetalert/tree/issue127). It seems to work insofar as the focus returns to the button on the page.

However, it reveals another issue: You still can't tab to another button, and when you hit Enter to show the alert again, things get weird.
",jack126guy,
127,2014-10-17 14:46:11,"Yes I attempted a similar fix to yours but with a window global variable to make sure it's an element from the website other than SweetAlert, it does focus the element on the document but the Tab key is still not working.

What seems to have fixed it for now is removing the **stopEventPropagation(e)** in the **if(keycode == 9)** clause in the **handleKeyDown** method. But I'm guessing there are other side-effects to this...

I would show you a commit but I did some other changes to the library as well that others might not want.

I can't really see the same use case for the cancel button. Shouldn't they always have the same color, and in that case, wouldn't it just be easier to change the CSS?

113,2014-10-16 09:51:12,"I added it because I needed to change the color to match the color scheme of the rest of my UI.

For some reason when I tried to override the color through CSS ( .sweet-alert button.cancel ) the selector never matched. My CSS was being brought in correctly and being applied to other elements but wasn't even showing up as being overridden in the 'Computed' tab in Chrome for the alert.

But considering the confirm button color option can be used to change the color of the OK button on normal alerts I thought there would have been an option to change the Cancel button color.

Did you blocked access to outside sources with 'Content-Security-Policy' or are you just working on a project on a computer without internet access?

About the advice... If you don't have access to Google, the only thing you can do is to download the necessary font files.
As you can see the first line in sweet-alert.css is:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

So take this URL and download it as a .css file to your own hosting & change the first line in the sweet-alert.css file so the URL will point to a new .css file on your hosting.
But unfortunately (for you) it's not the end.
Now in the new imported .css file as you can see, it has lots of URLs that points too all sorts of fonts,
you'll have to download them one by one and change all the URLs that will point to those fonts on your own server.

It's because SweetAlert crashing with the bootstrap modal, I guess you're trying to prompt a sweet alert when you have an opened modal (of bootstrap). That's when this error you've mentioned is happening.

You can with Javascript right before you open the Sweetalert, just use .hide() on the bootstrap modal,

As you can see in the function in the end of the object, I tell him to prompt back the modal.

If you hit ""enter"" in the current implementation, the modal will disappear regardless of what the value of ""closeOnEnter"" is. It's probably an easy fix, but I am a bit tired. :)

To be modal the ""focusable"" elements list is reduced to the two buttons ( $modalButtons = modal.querySelectorAll('buttons[tabindex]') ) and the focus/blur implementation is going to make it funny... you can't make form elements get focus (because the onBlur implementation). If focus is in an element not in this buttons list the Enter key makes OK button $targetElement (L448+) and the click event is send (L463+).
I'm building forms inside swal windows and I'm dealing with it. What I did is to make the querySelectorAll not 'button[tabindex]', but '[tabindex]', and gave from elements a tabindex value. This way those element become focusable & tabbable, you can navigate those controls using tab keys and get the default browser behaviour to check/uncheck with spacebar, can use carriage returns inside textareas, etc.
That change in the code seems minimal to me and I've not found any undesirable side effect yet.

For me the issue was solved by just wrapping the `swal` call in a function:
function() {

}

Something to do with the scope of `this` I think. I guess this is a similar solution as wrapping it in a `setTimeout()` as @BernhardBezdek did. Except that that also puts calling the function at the end of the queue. But - at least in my case - it wasn't an asynchronous issue.

Luckily Ecmascript 6 solved this weird Javascript behaviour with `this`. Now to wait until all browsers support it (or setup that polyfill/transpilation environment).

As the new default for this configuration option is `true`, the idiom

I saw your plugin and I really like the style of it, but it has a minor flaw, what if you want to create a confirmation alert ? You can't with your script, which is a bummer. It would be a challenge to code for sure (I had to do it for our company's application), as you'd need a custom way of handling the user's choices, because you can't tap into the native alerts' confirmation, but I think it'd make your script more versatile.

Best of luck,

Well, since I've done the work, I figured provide this too.

Note, there's a bug with explicitly dispatching a mouse event from the keyboard event in Chrome _IF_ that mouse event opens an alert box (as far as I could tell, anyway) then the mouse-click event re-enters. The koyboard-shortcuts branch is susceptible to this (as I think is noted in the issue thread). 

The work-around is to let the browser handler SPACE or ENTER on a button (which they all appear to do) and only dispatch the event if SPACE or ENTER were pressed outside of a button (i.e. in the window.onkeydown event).

Also, ESC should only cancel the alert if there is a cancel button, like the main JavaScript alert dialog does. Can easily make this confgurable of course.

This also tries to ensure that where we modify event handlers on document and window that we restore them to their previous values when the modal alert is close.

Please give this a go and see if it's broken. I think this works pretty well though.

I do still need to add shift-tab.

",t4t5,2014-10-05 09:23:11
11,2014-10-03 06:02:14,"@t4t5 OK, actually the focus thing makes sense, since the modal elements are being hidden and not removed. Storing the state of document.activeElement and restoring it on close should be sufficient to stop that behaviour. The 2nd pull wasn't a duplicate, it had a 1 line fix for the tab problem (preventing default tab action when the modal is open), but I forgot to close the first PR so I  can see why it wasn't obvious.

@pomeh I don't know what @t4t5 's stance on this is, but personally I think the blocking parts of the vanilla alert are the worst parts about it, and one of the reasons that I would want to use something else. A modern piece of web software shouldn't be trying to lock a user.
",FrancisStokes,2014-10-05 09:23:11
11,2014-10-03 18:24:19,"@FrancisStokes Agreed on the blocking, I don't like it either. :)
It seems like there was a small querySelector bug which screwed up the tabbing for me when I tested earlier. I pushed a quick fix to the keyboard-shortcuts branch just now. 

The things that are still weird now based on my tests are:
- Pressing enter right after a modal is shown just relaunches the modal (imo, the confirm-button should be selected by default so that you can quickly dismiss it by pressing enter)
- If you tab to a confirm-button that has a function attached to it, clicking enter seems to call the function twice.

I don't have time to dig into this any deeper right now unfortunately, but hopefully it can be solved soon!
",t4t5,2014-10-05 09:23:11
11,2014-10-04 18:07:14,"The issue you're talking about with calling the function twice is a bug in Chrome wherein if you generate a mouse event and the mouse event opens an alert(), the mouse event re-enters. I'm not sure if this has to happen from a keyboard event or not. See http://jsfiddle.net/nixta/msauoxj2/19/ for a clean example. This drove me to distraction for hours yesterday :)

However, since sweetalert uses buttons, browsers will automatically treat ENTER or SPACE clicks when that button is focused as a mouse click, so it makes sense that sweetalert should make use of that. When the keyboard focus is _not_ on a button, then dispatching an event works.

I'd built a fully functioning keyboard-handler branch before I noticed PR #11, so I've just made a PR of that as PR #40. I'm not saying it's better, I just wanted to get the code out there for review. I'd be happy to work it into PR #11, or rework PR #40, depending on consensus.

PR #40 attempts to ensure that focus remains on one of the buttons, but as a fallback will fire an event should it have to.

It also only accepts ESC if there is a cancel button (like the JavaScript alert() seems to).

I find this to be really nice when working with client-side async workflows.  For example:

$.get('/some/endpoint')
    .then(function () {
        return swal({   
            title: ""Success!"",
            text: ""You got /some/endpoint.  Want to fetch another?"",

    })
    .then(function () {
        return $.get('/the/next/endpoint');
    })
    .then(goToNextPage);

Anyway, I consider promise support critical for any modal solution so I can compose messaging into my promise-based workflows!

Edit: I called out that dismiss right now rejects the deferred.  This is kind of an arbitrary decision and I am happy to make that resolve instead.  This could be made into a param option too.

One question though: how would you like to implement [the polyfill](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise)?  Or perhaps, no polyfill and instead only return a promise if there's native support?

I can clean up stuff later if you actually want to remove the jquery dependency.

Also, there are a lot of 'polyfills' to cover IE8... If you are cool with IE9+ we can clean this up even more.

I can understand removing jQuery as a dep.  I can rewrite mine to use ES6 promises if you want to include [a polyfill for it](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise).

2,2014-10-01 08:30:57,"@adamterlson I guess it's best to get rid of the jQuery dependency as soon as possible and then continue from there. Would be awesome to support promises after that!

2,2014-10-01 14:51:42,"@connyay Yeah - I don't think I would have run jshint or JsFormat on someone else's code (certainly not in the same PR as something else I'm working on).  There's nothing wrong with a stylistic PR, but it comes across as petty/presumptive when you do it in the same commit as a material change.  Instead of being ""hey, I made this pass jshint - what do you think?"", it says ""clearly a _professional_ would have used the same style as me, so I'm just going to presume that mine is better and change it without talking about it.""  I understand that that wasn't your intention, but that's how it reads.

Congrats on your first PR!
