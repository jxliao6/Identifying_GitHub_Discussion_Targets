630,2017-01-23 01:41:54,"Hey @geodeveloper

Do you have a callback function after the input swal?

If so, I assume you have another swal as the success message, which has its own settings (none of which are inherited by its parent). You would have to redeclare the `showCancelbutton` property.",fallen-rve,geodeveloper
630,2017-01-24 16:27:09,"Hi @fallen-rve,
Yes I have a callback function. I've took the example of input from official sweetalert website and just added the default config on top. Take a look here --> https://jsfiddle.net/a836z9xv/ so you can see the bug.

Thanks for your time.",geodeveloper,fallen-rve
630,2017-01-29 00:54:40,"@geodeveloper gotcha!

That is the expected behavior of `setDefaults`. If you set the `setDefaults` property, it'll apply to all of your SweetAlerts, regardless if it's the shorthand or longhand versions.

From the documentation:
> If you end up using a lot of the same settings when calling SweetAlert, you can use setDefaults at the start of your program to set them once and for all!

Let me know if that clears it up.

sweetalert2 was forked before v1.0, so the structure of the project is quite different. This doesn't necessarily mean that it's not a good alternative. If there's a feature in there that you need, you should of course use it.

It kinda bugs med that it's called sweetalert2 though, since that makes it sound like it's a natural progression of this project, even though I'm planning a 2.0 release later this year...

Anyways, free software, do what you like. Just wanted to say sorry for being unresponsive, and that I'm planning on becoming more active soon.

456,2015-10-08 09:09:39,"@henryg0mez So if I understand things correctly, the problem is that your form gets submitted even though you haven't entered any input? 

Is this really a problem with SweetAlert? Keep in mind that the only recommended way to handle user inputs through swal is by using `type: input`. Everything else with custom HTML should be considered a ""hack"".

If your form submits even though it's empty, I can only guess that the problem lies within the  `myForm.valid()`-function.

And when it comes to ""I am not sure that anything actually happens on submit. When submit is clicked, a php file is called through AJAX that should send an email"", well, you should be able to just log your stuff in the PHP console to check if it went through or not. Can't really help you anymore than this. :)

456,2015-10-08 09:52:18,"@t4t5 - yes, the email did submit at first until I modified the code in an attempt to stop the send function if nothing was typed in the fields.

409,2015-08-15 10:33:17,"@t4t5 I think that having the markup and the parameters (via the data-\* attributes) of the modal in the html would be really cool.
Then to open an alert you would have to pass the alert id to the `swal()` function.

Example:





Would add a cancel button then show the modal by adding it the class ""current-sweetalert-modal"" (to avoid collision with others current classes that the user could have in it's `CSS`.

409,2015-08-27 07:47:48,"We could recommend/use a [client-side templating engine](http://garann.github.io/template-chooser/) to structure it all. I personally favour React.js because it supports type validation out of the box when you pass in properties to a component, but of course anything else could work. 

I think the only problem with this solution might be that this would require a significant rewrite. Specifically, `sweetalert-dev.js` has a `switch` statement with an object case that simply updates the default params, rather than let you define your own. Like @t4t5 mentions, there is only one SweetAlert box that keeps getting updated each time. We need a way to 'subclass' objects - to have a base `SweetAlert` object that simply checks the `type` argument supplied, and then calls the template involved. 

One way to do this - and the one I think would be most painless, given how extensive SweetAlert is - would be to have a function called `registerTemplate()`, which registers a template in a store accessible to `swal`. `swal` would then check the `type` argument on being invoked against an internal list -`success`,`input`,`error`,`warning` - and, if not found, default to passing all other arguments to the template and somehow render it. I think `_sweetAlertInitialize$getModal$getOverlay$getInput$setFocusStyle$openModal$resetInput$fixVerticalPosition` might be able to handle the rendering, although I'd have to take a closer look at it, I'm not sure.

The line of CSS you mention is in there, however, if you wrap your input in form tags, and have styling like `form input {display:block}` that should take precedence.

There is another problem putting form fields in using `html: true`, because everything in `text` gets wrapped in `<p>...</p>`, and it is invalid to have form elements inside `p` tags. I fixed this locally by switching the `p` tags for divs. I will fork and submit a pull request; you are welcome to checkout my fork.

But how can you trigger a close event in your sweetalert2 plugin? In my case, I'd like to show an overlay with a ""well done"" or ""oops..."" message and perform an ajax request in the background. Once the data comes back from the server and is passed to the DOM, the modal should close itself. As I can't predict how long the ajax request will need, I can't use the timer function.

Btw. on line 258 you have an error:  
`params.allowEscapeKey = arguments[0].allowEscapeKey !== undefined ? arguments[0].showConfirmButton : defaultParams.allowEscapeKey;`  

should be:  
`params.allowEscapeKey = arguments[0].allowEscapeKey !== undefined ? arguments[0].allowEscapeKey : defaultParams.allowEscapeKey;`

For me the issue was solved by just wrapping the `swal` call in a function:

Something to do with the scope of `this` I think. I guess this is a similar solution as wrapping it in a `setTimeout()` as @BernhardBezdek did. Except that that also puts calling the function at the end of the queue. But - at least in my case - it wasn't an asynchronous issue.

It seems like there was a small querySelector bug which screwed up the tabbing for me when I tested earlier. I pushed a quick fix to the keyboard-shortcuts branch just now. 

The things that are still weird now based on my tests are:
- Pressing enter right after a modal is shown just relaunches the modal (imo, the confirm-button should be selected by default so that you can quickly dismiss it by pressing enter)
- If you tab to a confirm-button that has a function attached to it, clicking enter seems to call the function twice.

I don't have time to dig into this any deeper right now unfortunately, but hopefully it can be solved soon!

Just tested this issue. If im on the sweetalert homepage and open a regular alert, no scrolling able. If i open an sweet alert im able to scroll and even press another button while an alert is open.

So the Problem with your code:
body {
    touch-action: none;
    height: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
}

is, that im now not even able to zoom in the page at all. Thats not that great..
