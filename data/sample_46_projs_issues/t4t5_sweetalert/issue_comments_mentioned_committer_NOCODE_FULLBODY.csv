I know that sometimes we need to focus on something else and it's always a good choice to invite collaborators.

Perhaps we could merge your repo with sweetalert2?

Surely there has to be a way to stop SweetAlert from submitting the form and verify there are actually valid values entered in the fields? I would really like to get form validation working on Swal. Otherwise I am looking at using Wordpress' Contact Form 7 with pop-up as a work around.

multiples around throw anything off?

409,2015-07-29 18:19:38,"@t4t5 Maybe this: if you pass in a string to swal(), it's behavior is
unchanged. If you want swal() to function as a modal, you set a new
parameter, content, to the selector of the div you want to use in the swal
object? I think there could still be only one then.

409,2015-08-15 10:33:17,"@t4t5 I think that having the markup and the parameters (via the data-\* attributes) of the modal in the html would be really cool.
Then to open an alert you would have to pass the alert id to the `swal()` function.

Example:





Would add a cancel button then show the modal by adding it the class ""current-sweetalert-modal"" (to avoid collision with others current classes that the user could have in it's `CSS`.
",SkyzohKey,t4t5
409,2015-08-27 07:47:48,"We could recommend/use a [client-side templating engine](http://garann.github.io/template-chooser/) to structure it all. I personally favour React.js because it supports type validation out of the box when you pass in properties to a component, but of course anything else could work. 

I think the only problem with this solution might be that this would require a significant rewrite. Specifically, `sweetalert-dev.js` has a `switch` statement with an object case that simply updates the default params, rather than let you define your own. Like @t4t5 mentions, there is only one SweetAlert box that keeps getting updated each time. We need a way to 'subclass' objects - to have a base `SweetAlert` object that simply checks the `type` argument supplied, and then calls the template involved. 

One way to do this - and the one I think would be most painless, given how extensive SweetAlert is - would be to have a function called `registerTemplate()`, which registers a template in a store accessible to `swal`. `swal` would then check the `type` argument on being invoked against an internal list -`success`,`input`,`error`,`warning` - and, if not found, default to passing all other arguments to the template and somehow render it. I think `_sweetAlertInitialize$getModal$getOverlay$getInput$setFocusStyle$openModal$resetInput$fixVerticalPosition` might be able to handle the rendering, although I'd have to take a closer look at it, I'm not sure.

I'm testing your plugin which is quite cool, so far I love it.

But I'm facing an issue on IE8 (I know, some of our client still use it...), but anyways the error is

Webpage error details

This is the function in question



This is the code I'm using to show up the message



This works fine on all other browsers I tested (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

Thanks in advance

Do you think you can bring your fixed to @t4t5 to merge in its branch 0.5 to have an ""official"" 0.5.1 available on npm ?

It might be worth to have a chat with @t4t5 to get you added as a repository maintainer moving forward and merging the versions together as well.

200,2014-12-14 22:56:05,"I agree, that a close event would be better, as @mwakerman is right, that it will be on the event queue, since the function does use setTimeout. if its `swal('close')` or swal.cancel is up to @t4t5 to choose.

I see @t4t5 put the `escapeHtml` everywhere, may be he wanted to prevent XSS attack or something. 
How do I change my submited pull request? Or just make another pull request?

97,2014-10-23 22:30:33,"@t4t5 I see you merged the `sweetAlertInitialize()` method which is very nice of you since we can now use the lib with Turbolinks. But I now think this should be done with the same naming convention as for setting the default parameters. So I updated my pull request and the initialize method should now be called `swal.init()`. I think it makes it more consistent with the way it now works.

One question though: how would you like to implement [the polyfill](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise)?  Or perhaps, no polyfill and instead only return a promise if there's native support?
