I'm a bit on the fence about it personally - we don't have any questions related to syntax errors currently, but at the same time I suspect this might be interpreted as a bit of a trick question in the context of an interview. Thoughts @darcyclarke @appleboy?
",richgilbank,jacopotarantino
346,2016-02-24 23:11:21,"@richgilbank no worries :). I wasn't 100% sure it fit the theme of the list but it felt worth submitting. If I may, here's a little backstory:

It suddenly hit me the other day that I had no idea what that would do because I'd never tried it(an empty `if` statement would be pretty strange). I tried it out to check what would happen and then asked a few coworkers what they thought. The varied responses I got from them made me think this is a good interview question.

The point of asking the question in an interview is more to see how much detail a person can give in response and how they might justify their response. So while someone more astute like yourself might know/assume that it's a syntax error they will hopefully be able to describe why it's a syntax error and one can ask a followup question about what happens to the process/execution flow. Or someone less thoughtful like myself might assume that it is valid JavaScript (because why not) and describe to the interviewer how the content(lack thereof) of the parens is evaluated and what happens with the final value. Maybe dig into type coercion a bit as a followup.

There's probably another dimension to this but I haven't thought of it yet. Anyway, that's the process that lead to the PR.

It would be good to have a more standardized way of contributing translations going forward as well as creating a build process for generating the markdown file along with any kind of website.

My initial thoughts are to have all the questions moved into a JSON data store and generate both a simple, single-page, website and the markdown file from that.

@richgilbank I agree. With _30+_ questions, that section does seem a bit `.length`y :wink: Although, the **CSS** section isn't too far behind, so we may need to consider it as well (or _very_ soon). 

**Initial Feedback:**
The terms `language`, `usage` and `implementation` don't sound succinct enough to me. `Usage` and `implementation`, specifically, sound like the same topic/too similar. That said, I may need to see the division, as you have it in mind, to appreciate the different correlations and what will go where. It may make sense to start a Pull Request now with the changes you think work and we can discuss the verbage and categorization more there.

**Alternative Suggestion:**
I had once thought of splitting up all the sections into context-specific sub-categories like: `What`, `Where`, `When`, `Why`, `How` and `Explain`. Most questions fit nicely into these categories already and this approach would help guide phrasing for future additions (ie. someone would know exactly `what` goes `where`). It definitely has the potential to add a lot of sub-categories and spreading out content but it's just a thought. 

I'm definitely open to any other suggestions in terms of sub-categorization. A simple reorg, grouping similar questions/phrasing, might also help with discovery.

Also, I think that's the nature of open source though, or maybe I'm just more forgiving precisely because it is really based on public contribution.

269,2015-02-25 17:21:57,"Last week, while being interviewed on [the changelog podcast](http://thechangelog.com/143/), I was asked _why this project doesn't have a proper website_. It's not well known but we do have a Github Page that is just a nicer looking version of the markdown file at http://h5bp.github.io/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/. 

I've also been asked countless times about what questions a _""Junior""_ or a _""Senior""_ Developer should know or be asked from this document. Terminology like this, of course, can be polarizing. Everyone's concept of a _Junior_ or _Senior_ Developer is different and every role has it's own specific challenges and knowledge requirements. Although those specific labels aren't helpful, I've begun to think that including **meta-data** and having the ability to **label** questions would be infinitely helpful for discoverability.

Sub-categorization is already being talked about in @richgilbank's issue #257, although I think we need to think about this a bit more broadly. Currently, we're extremely limited in how we can format and showcase content based on using only a markdown file. That said, I think there's a serious need to broaden the horizons of this project and **build a proper website**. 

The [HTML5 Please](http://html5please.com/) site is a good example of the kind of labelling/filtering we could add to questions to make search/discoverability much easier. But that's just the beginning. 

Thoughts, feedback and suggestions are welcomed.

Sorry for a last minute ask, but @darcyclarke any chance you'd be open to come on The Changelog today at 3pm CT via Skype to talk about this project?

We had a last minute guest cancellation for today's show, and we were already linking this project up in [the next issue of Weekly](http://thechangelog.com/weekly/) that ships tomorrow -- so we thought, why not get them on the podcast!

You might have heard of our show, but if not -- The Changelog is a podcast covering what's fresh and new in open source. Listen to the show here http://thechangelog.com/podcast/ or here http://5by5.tv/changelog
