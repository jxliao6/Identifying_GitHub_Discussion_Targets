1) There are no answers in this repository, only questions, right? So what's the point of providing answers instead of adding security questions first?

2) Supposing that answers are a requirement before adding questions, allow me to analyze your quote: ""I'd say come up with a short, concise and memorable set of answers that anyone should be able to memorize, in point form or using short and simple sentences""

So basically the point is memorize questions and answers for interviews without really understanding the meaning of such answers? If that's the case the whole idea is part of the problem. You're only promoting memorization challenges instead of promoting the study that should be done instead. How is it really helpful? I'd love to help people to LEARN security instead of MEMORIZING answers to pass interviews. In short it looks a b.s. theater. Am I wrong? I hope I am, but doesn't look like to be the case.",andersonDadario,

I do appreciate your time to help, however it's important to stress how important this repository is and why we should not have answers 'easy to memorize' rather than 'easy to understand'. Lots of people grab questions from here. I believe that's more serious than ever as the amount of stars and views of this repository grows.

---

Domain knowledge over a specific topic isn't what you should be interviewing for. If the candidate doesn't know HTTP2 protocols (which wouldn't surprise me at this time of writing), it's something they can learn if they absolutely need to.

What you _should_ be interviewing for is the ability to solve problems and be adaptable. In almost all cases, candidates that show strong signs of these two traits will be the most successful, as they are the ones that can learn a new language on the drop of a dime or pick up a new technology overnight when your projects call for it.

I've even considered developing an interview question that uses a fake programming language just to see their reasoning for a solution to a problem (or even using a stack based language). Yes, it's hard - but I feel like the field has been setting the bar too low to begin with. I want to see how they react to something _new_, and see if they can reason about approaching something that isn't regurgitated factual information.

If you can google it in a reasonable amount of time, _you shouldn't be interviewing for it_.

There is obviously the need to ensure they know basic design principles as well as coding knowledge, but there's a reason why I always combat ""signals"" people get when they interview for a specific technology (i.e. jQuery or React specifically).

Not every candidate is going to have the same background, and by isolating specific knowledge (or the lack thereof) you're going to be missing out on a lot of potentially kickass employees.

Just my thoughts.
",Qix-,
363,2016-08-15 13:10:03,"As someone else mentioned, it's partially covered under the question which asks about certain headers, but I'd argue that it's also sort of covered in the following question: ""Do your best to describe the process from the time you type in a website's URL to it finishing loading on your screen.""

To me this is a great question that leaves a lot of room for discussion and the interviewer can dig a little deeper if the answer given isn't sufficient. At a minimum I would expect candidates to know that headers are sent with the request, but I wouldn't expect them to rattle off a list of headers because that's not really that important.

If they mention a few then perhaps it's a bonus, but FE developers rarely look at headers. I inspect network traffic on a daily basis on the enterprise app I work on, but I'm far more focused on looking at response data/time and almost never look at the headers.

Anyway, if it were me then I'd rephrase the question to the one I listed above then list out the following steps.
1. HTTP GET request is made to the server to request a resource for the given Request-URI which includes a few common request headers.
2. Server responds with a Status Code of 200 indicating that the request was successful along with the document in the response body and a few common headers.
3. The document received in the response body is parsed by the browser (HTML parser) and DOM tree construction begins. Note that as script tags are encountered (assuming they are synchronous) parsing halts while the script is loaded and executed as this is a blocking operation.
4. As the DOM tree is being constructed, the CSS parser begins constructing the CSSOM tree as the parser encounters stylesheets, embedded styles, or inline styles.
5. At the same time, the DOM and CSSOM are combined to create the Render Tree (i.e. visual representation of the DOM). The Render Tree consists of visual elements (renderers, aka rectangles) in the order in which they will be displayed. This is where style computation happens (selector rule matching) as each element has its visual properties calculated.
6. Layout (aka Reflow) then occurs on each element to calculate the exact position and size (box model).
7. Finally, the Render Tree is passed to the paint process to render the pixels on the screen allowing the user to interact with the document.

358,2016-06-25 16:37:07,"Hey there,

I just noticed the [`gh-pages` site](https://h5bp.github.io/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/) hasn't been updated in more than a year. It is referenced on the GitHub repository's main page, and I imagine some people might be looking at this 1-year old version of the content instead of what's in the README file. There's been discussions about [making a full-fledged site from this repo](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/issues/269) in #269, but that was a while ago. Regardless of where those go, I think the issue of having out of sync content is worth addressing.

**There are two potential solutions, and this PR is the simplest of the two:**
- Getting rid of the `gh-pages` site (by removing its content, adding a redirect to https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions, and removing the link from the repo home).
- Automatically deploying to the `gh-pages` branch when merging in master using a service like Travis. This would require the use of a 3rd-party service, some configuration, and a deployment key.

I decided to open this as a PR with the minimum changes required for solution 1 because it's that much easier to implement. I like solution 2 as well but it involves more moving parts, initial effort and maintenance.

Here is what the deprecation notice looks like at the moment: https://rawgit.com/ThibWeb/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/gh-pages-deprecation/index.html

It could be completed with a client-side redirect (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5411538/redirect-from-an-html-page) and a `robots` meta tag, but that sounds a bit overkill.

But if you ask me about `event bubbling/capturing` - I'll say you about two phases of event processing ( capturing - down / bubbling - up ), how it allow to manipulate with order of handlers, what is good practice/ what is not ( what we shouldn't use capturing phases without special reasons ), about fact, that not all events bubble up , etc. And delegation is only the special case of usage of bubbling, so you or listen about in the end, or I just miss that fact, cause it's not what about you ask. 

Out of scope, but another example of such pair: - You can ask me `what is closure?` and `How to save context on creating callbacks ( meaning something like`var that = this;`and usage of`that` in callback ) - there are two different questions ( related - yes, but not similar )

I'm a bit on the fence about it personally - we don't have any questions related to syntax errors currently, but at the same time I suspect this might be interpreted as a bit of a trick question in the context of an interview. Thoughts @darcyclarke @appleboy?
",richgilbank,
346,2016-02-24 23:11:21,"@richgilbank no worries :). I wasn't 100% sure it fit the theme of the list but it felt worth submitting. If I may, here's a little backstory:

It suddenly hit me the other day that I had no idea what that would do because I'd never tried it(an empty `if` statement would be pretty strange). I tried it out to check what would happen and then asked a few coworkers what they thought. The varied responses I got from them made me think this is a good interview question.

The point of asking the question in an interview is more to see how much detail a person can give in response and how they might justify their response. So while someone more astute like yourself might know/assume that it's a syntax error they will hopefully be able to describe why it's a syntax error and one can ask a followup question about what happens to the process/execution flow. Or someone less thoughtful like myself might assume that it is valid JavaScript (because why not) and describe to the interviewer how the content(lack thereof) of the parens is evaluated and what happens with the final value. Maybe dig into type coercion a bit as a followup.

There's probably another dimension to this but I haven't thought of it yet. Anyway, that's the process that lead to the PR.

This is in reference the network questions and specifically 'What are HTTP actions? List all HTTP actions that you know, and explain them.'.

I assume this is to be HTTP _methods_, GET, POST, PATCH, PUT etc? 

If this is the case, why was the term 'HTTP Actions' used, and is this a commonly used term? I googled like heck and there's very little specifically relating to this term, and what little there is is actually regarding HTTP methods.

isn't exactly the same with what I had in mind when proposing this question. True, no style has more _important_ (dis)advantages than the other, but the question should give the interviewee a good chance to show off their knowledge/skill (compression? consistency? IDE compatibility?)

This is pretty good, but seems like we could make it better, e.g. by specifying a context. On mobile network requests will have a lot more impact, for example, so you might want to focus on very aggressive caching. Or you could specify ""x feels sluggish; where do you begin?"". If ""x"" was e.g. an animation, you might profile the JS, and if it was something taking a really long time to load, you might look at caching.

Animations: CSS, JavaScript, SVG, Canvas or Flash. When to use which and what are some of the pros and cons of each.
",marcobiedermann,
279,2015-04-07 18:07:07,"Some quick notes:
- Canvas animations are controlled by JavaScript
- Opinion: SVG animations are often controlled by JavaScript
- Opinion: Flash is no longer relevant for UI/animations

I think what this question alludes to, right now, is a level of control over animation (ie. if/how you are able to start, stop, pause or reverse) and less about the contents being animated (ie. DOM elements). I also don't see much of a difference between CSS vs. SVG animations unless you start to incorporate manipulation of objects (ie. vector shapes/paths), but again, that deals more with the contents.

I think it may get a bit confusing if we try to differentiate between a JavaScript and a Canvas or SVG animation. Not sure where we should land here.

My guess: Maybe comparing GET and POST, and GET and HEAD ([haha](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/myl/GardnerFishAndChips.png)) as pairs, each makes more sense than comparing POST and HEAD. But still, shouldn't one question about HTTP methods be enough?

Totally agree though, about not adding all other actions.

Second thought: Maybe a generic question like this can cover all.

269,2015-02-25 17:21:57,"Last week, while being interviewed on [the changelog podcast](http://thechangelog.com/143/), I was asked _why this project doesn't have a proper website_. It's not well known but we do have a Github Page that is just a nicer looking version of the markdown file at http://h5bp.github.io/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions/. 

I've also been asked countless times about what questions a _""Junior""_ or a _""Senior""_ Developer should know or be asked from this document. Terminology like this, of course, can be polarizing. Everyone's concept of a _Junior_ or _Senior_ Developer is different and every role has it's own specific challenges and knowledge requirements. Although those specific labels aren't helpful, I've begun to think that including **meta-data** and having the ability to **label** questions would be infinitely helpful for discoverability.

Sub-categorization is already being talked about in @richgilbank's issue #257, although I think we need to think about this a bit more broadly. Currently, we're extremely limited in how we can format and showcase content based on using only a markdown file. That said, I think there's a serious need to broaden the horizons of this project and **build a proper website**. 

The [HTML5 Please](http://html5please.com/) site is a good example of the kind of labelling/filtering we could add to questions to make search/discoverability much easier. But that's just the beginning. 

Thoughts, feedback and suggestions are welcomed.

Search/filter and labels is a good start. If the website src is on Github too, I'd definitely jump in and fork.

Where relevant though, how do we keep the two projects synchronized? Is it a manual process, or the (let's call it) markdown file will have some convention applied so that auto parsing is possible? Also, how about the translations?
",phanan,
269,2015-02-26 01:27:29,"@phanan Good points. Translations are tricky right now as they've all been done kind of piecemeal without much thought or organization. It would be good to have a more standardized way of contributing translations going forward as well as creating a build process for generating the markdown file along with any kind of website.

My initial thoughts are to have all the questions moved into a JSON data store and generate both a simple, single-page, website and the markdown file from that. 
",darcyclarke,
269,2015-02-26 06:01:15,"The idea with JSON actually reminds me of [caniuse](https://github.com/fyrd/caniuse) instead of HTML5 Please. I'm not a contributor of caniuse, but according to its documentation:

> The data on the site is stored in a database. This data is periodically exported to the JSON files on GitHub. Once a change or new file here has been approved, it is integrated back into the database and the subsequent export files should be the same as the imported ones. 

Are you taking a similar approach? 
",phanan,
269,2015-02-26 06:19:09,"FYI, the way HTML5 Please handles this is quite easy. In the past we had everything in JSON but we switched over to YAML. The build process (powered by gulp) reads all files and compiles a static, simple HTML page. 

> forward as well as creating a build process for generating the markdown file along with any kind of website

Sure! :+1: 

> Are you taking a similar approach?

I'm wondering why that would make sense. I believe caniuse is doing this mainly because they want to be able to query their 'database' without loading 100 JSON files. Don't think that's needed for us.

You are mistaken about the question's origin.

@matachines We won't be including any library-specific content in the future (ie. jQuery, Angular, Polymer, Ember, Backbone, Underscore, Node, Express etc.). Native implementations and general concepts, patterns and architecture questions are different. 

---

@phanan my hope is that we'll always be able to maintain a single file by improving organization/navigation as we grow bigger.

---

@richgilbank I agree. With _30+_ questions, that section does seem a bit `.length`y :wink: Although, the **CSS** section isn't too far behind, so we may need to consider it as well (or _very_ soon). 

**Initial Feedback:**
The terms `language`, `usage` and `implementation` don't sound succinct enough to me. `Usage` and `implementation`, specifically, sound like the same topic/too similar. That said, I may need to see the division, as you have it in mind, to appreciate the different correlations and what will go where. It may make sense to start a Pull Request now with the changes you think work and we can discuss the verbage and categorization more there.

**Alternative Suggestion:**
I had once thought of splitting up all the sections into context-specific sub-categories like: `What`, `Where`, `When`, `Why`, `How` and `Explain`. Most questions fit nicely into these categories already and this approach would help guide phrasing for future additions (ie. someone would know exactly `what` goes `where`). It definitely has the potential to add a lot of sub-categories and spreading out content but it's just a thought. 

I'm definitely open to any other suggestions in terms of sub-categorization. A simple reorg, grouping similar questions/phrasing, might also help with discovery.

Combining them in one  sentence thus doesn't seem right.

I've come up with 3 options for this:
1. Describe the difference between cookies, session storage and local storage.

Nah. We had various discussions about it in html5 boilerplate: https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues/1614.

From my experience, a few developers only use one or another (which is fine) and can't really tell the difference.

To bring that sentiment full-circle, jQuery's `.queue`/`.dequeue` implementation isn't unique. That said, if I wanted to know whether someone understood synchronous vs. asynchronous processes then I might instead ask them something like, `How could/would you queue up a number of functions to run synchronously?` I may even ask them to write an implementation from scratch (time permitting).

Of course, some people may respond to that question by referencing jQuery's API and some may not. Either way, I'm still vetting that they have the knowledge and understanding I'm looking for on that topic (_which isn't framework or library specific_).

It's also always a good idea to get legal counsel when deciding which license to use or associate with your software. I guess what I'm saying is that front-end developers aren't usually the best people at choosing or understanding licensing unless it's [WTFPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL). 

At a high-level I can see the masses being able to answer this question with **MIT**, **BSD**, **GPL** etc. but without much or any idea of the nuances to any of them (other then their relationship with _Open Source Software_).

Firstly, the original contributors list is for original contributors only (it shouldn't be modified unless you were apart of those initial discussions, which I know you weren't). 

Secondly, your intermediate example looks for a candidate to understand and provide code to showcase currying, which is covered by another example:

<S_CODE_TOKEN>

Thirdly, code written in your advanced example ultimately still utilizes a similar technique as the currying example before it. I don't know if it's different enough to make for a new coding example.

177,2014-12-08 17:59:10,"Hmm. Perhaps your right. Apologies for the contributor list addition, I didn't realize. As for the advanced example, yes it perhaps is a form of currying however I thought that the style of using functions as values, returning functions, and middle ware with a hint to monads would be a good opportunity for a candidate to ""show their stuff"".

That being said it might no warrant a place here. Since after a rebase there really isn't that much left to contribute, I'm just going to close this as you did before. If you have suggestions on how to use some of the changes in this PR let me know and I'll refactor.

161,2014-09-17 15:08:12,"In the scope of ""Front End Developer Interview Questions"" , I have a hard time seeing the react framework as a plausible question topic. It's a framework that is very new and rarely used in production. Let's not forget that it's only at version 0.11.1. I think popular and industry adopted tools (like angular and SASS) should be question topics, but react is jumping the gun a bit.

That said, I also don't know if there's a lot of value or weight to maintaining ""pixel-perfection"" these days. Static mockups are poor representations/references for developing websites (especially in terms of a responsive or gracefully degrading experience). I see more and more job descriptions for ""designers"" where they are required to code basic HTML/CSS/JS in order to properly conceptualize their ideas.

Just my two cents. If you feel strongly about it, feel free to give a rewording a try and re-submit.

This kind of questioning actually allows for a discussion about implementation details and you get to hear how a candidate thinks or how they use certain tools. It's less about factual knowledge and more about implementation experience (which is what you're probably after in the end).

25,2012-10-09 19:46:13,"Of course filing bugs and contributing code is even better, I totally
agree. But often you find that the issue is already filed.

Perhaps the question should be rephrased a little bit, I obviously didn't
mean just listing all the bugs you're subscribed to. It's rather something
like ""what are the most frustrating WebKit bugs you've personally come
across?"", does that make more sense? It can just be a segway to discussing
a non-trivial problem or talking about standards and candidate's attitude
towards things without being too abstract.

IE6 and above have the exact same box model as every other browser and version. See:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_box_model_bug#Workarounds

You could instead ask: ""What the difference between the old IE box model and the W3C box model"". But the way it's currently worded, it sounds like all versions of IE have the same box model.

""What are the differences between the IE box model and the W3C box model?""

I would rather see something like:

""What is the difference between content box and border box in CSS3?""

Or maybe:

""What is the difference between the IE5 box model and the W3C box model? And how does this relate to CSS3?""

The latter question might be better, because you'll quickly find out if they're familiar with the <code>box-sizing</code> property and how it mimics the old box model.

""What does 'quirks mode' mean and how does this affect the box model?""

That might actually be better because then it would be up to the person interviewed to mention that it's an IE thing, that it's prior to IE6, it requires a doctype to avoid it, and its relation to the box-sizing property.
