- Collection has a Table of Contents section, but it's named `Table of Contents`, not `Contents`.
- Items are formatted consistently, but descriptions start with a lowercase.
- Collection does not have the Awesome badge yet as I figured I'd only add this when the list is accepted.

- Instead of calling it `Libraries/Frameworks`, just use `Modules` or `Packages`, which applies to both.
- The license is not a good license. Use something common and proven. I would recommend CC0, see: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md#choose-an-appropriate-license
- I'd like to see some links to community resources: Stack Overflow tag, IRC, chat, forums, communities, etc. Example: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron#community

* changed to the CC0 license
* added community resources

* Cleared up non-relevant material

I do however want to discuss the wording of `Libraries` over either `Modules` or `Packages`. I did get rid of `Framework` but if you do a Google search for ""WebGL Modules"" or ""WebGL Package"" you will not find anything. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WebGL_frameworks) even uses the terms ""Frameworks"", ""Libraries"" and ""Engine"" which is the common term among the community. I understand eliminating the ambiguity with two terms, but Library seems to be the term I feel best describes it all... Another idea I had was to poll the community as this list is for them more than anyone.

Let me know what you think about the poll idea

**[awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)**

RestQL-core is a Java/Clojure microservice query language to fetch information from multiple services. It should be included because many people look for some library or framework to centralize and query multiple APIs in a easier and more efficient manner.

With restQL-core people can map their API urls (resources) and use a query language (clojure) or the query builder to fetch resources from multiple sources in one query, instead of having to perform multiple calls separately.

Of course, if you will be doing this too often, you might want to create an account on that site.

> I honestly rather create an account in a great web app then use a crappy one without login

**From README:** Most of the apps mentioned here do provide some kind of a user account feature to save history and progress. But as already stated before, a user account is not necessary to use the main features of these apps.

Maybe I should add a marker for sites that allow logins ?

873,2017-01-26 14:15:13,"I find awesome lists particularly useful for finding libraries and I don't use the learning material part.

Making a meta list focusing on libraries and containing only awesome lists that curate libraries has following advantages

 - Better overview. ~4 times less lists.
 - Higher quality requirements. Many lists focus is on learning material and neglect the library part. These are not included in the meta list for programming libraries.
 - Improved UI. Since most libraries are hosted on GitHub, a tailored UI can be built, e.g. something like http://devarchy.com/react-components.

The obvious drawback is having two similar meta lists which may lead to confusion.

Beyond that the goal is to increase awareness that awesome lists are a good way to find libraries.
Most programmers I meet don't know about awesome lists so there is likely lot's of potential.

I've started creating such [programming library meta list](https://github.com/brillout/libraries/blob/ef94c565367b43fde69f8c40c9e6c2302fecab3c/README.md).",brillout,

> Many lists focus is on learning material and neglect the library part.

Unless they're explicitly about learning, I would say those lists fail. Open an issue with the maintainer if you encounter that.

873,2017-02-16 23:03:22,"> I don't see why you would separate those things

To focus on the quality. A poor library list without any learning material will not make it to a meta list. But a poor library list with great learning material would and does make it to a meta list.

> Awesome lists are on GitHub. It would no longer be an Awesome list then.

Same view here and devarchy is and will be two-way synced with GitHub.

> Open an issue with the maintainer

Yea and it's precisely what I'm doing with `awesome-vue`.
Sometimes it's not enough though and a fork is required and this is actually happening with `awesome-react`.

Each node in the mind map is another mind map and it can go as deep as needed. All in all its a more visual and approachable representation of knowledge, I feel like.

Fair enough, I added the focus to each description.

I added the awesome list to the training section and removed ones that are in the awesome list. The remaining programming training has been recommended by testers who found these particularly helpful, so I'm reluctant to remove them as they aren't in the list you linked.

>I think you should also make it clearer in the top short intro that this is about ""quality assurance software testing"", not ""automated software (unit) testing"". I was confused by that at first too.

Well, it does certainly need to be made more clear it seems! It's not about Unit testing as that is done by the developer role, but this is for Manual and Automated testers. The people who use this may not fall into the ""Quality Assurance"" title, but can fall under many such as ""Software Tester"", ""Security Tester"", ""QA Engineer"", ""Automation Engineer"" or ""UX Tester"". I added another quick sentence to the top of the page.

This list is targeted at anyone who does testing beyond the scope of the original developer. Unfortunately the only way to fully encompass all of these things is to just say it's ""for testers"".

> Maybe include https://www.reddit.com/r/QualityAssurance/ ?

I've been subscribed to that subreddit for a year and it's not very helpful. It's mostly people asking for help and getting bad replies and companies advertising their new crowd-sourcing testing platform. I did include a slack community which has a few thousand people and is open to questions if people have problems.

[I did](https://github.com/monostable/awesome-electronics/commit/90dd738f953afc482abbf693802081b7410d39b6), do you mean to say I should re-do the screenshots?

I don't know any very general ones. Would be a good section to have though.

See the linked example. Just a short description of what the list is actually about, like what is an electronics engineer, that the list is about creating custom electronics, boards, etc.

For example, in the linked example they have:

- The `About` section is too long. Make it more focused on what Less is and less history. I don't think it should be a separate section, but rather placed below the list title. Example: https://github.com/woop/awesome-quantified-self
- `Official Less Guide - Official Less guide.` - Don't add description when it's identical to the title. That's moot.
- `Tutorialzone - Learn Less in 10 Minutes (or Less).` - Here you have the title and description reversed.
- Drop the `Other Awesome Lists` section.
- `for Less.`, `to Less`, etc, are moot. This is a list for Less. Things being about Less is implied. Same with titles, like `Less Responsive Grid` => `Responsive Grid`, etc.
- Doesn't give me a lot of confidence in your list when the first item in `Tools` has been deprecated for years. Please go through all your entries and ensure there are only maintained & awesome entries.
- `More` => `More‚Ä¶`
- In contributing.md:

Why ""JavaScript Learning Resources"" and not just ""JavaScript Learning"" or ""Learn JavaScript""? The ""Resources"" part feels moot as all lists are resources for some subject.

**Information Retrieval and Web Search is a field which involves finding relevant information for a given query, be it for as simple as a database search, or as complicated as a web search (Eg - Google, Bing, Yahoo). There has been renewed interest in this field, thanks to Deep Learning and Vector Space Modeling. Finding content that is both relevant to the user, and has high topic relevance is the key point of research in this field. However, many don't know about the different resources available at out disposal. It would be a good idea to have a list of Awesome Information Retrieval and Web Search, for people to discover resources and make this field even more awesome.**

Addressed.

Changed.

> StackOverflow => Stack Overflow and the link should probably be: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nlp+ruby

I've expanded the search string to cover only Ruby and NLP specific questions.

> Why the nlproc search on Twitter? Should be clearer for the user what to expect. I expected Ruby related NLP tweets.

`#nlproc` is the standard hash tag for NLP related messages. But your objections are correct, I elaborated the query so we accept now a much stricter selection.
 
> `Useful resources for text processing in Ruby` is misleading. NLP is not plainly text processing.

Do you have any suggestions? I see your point that NLP is not text processing as in `MS Word is a text processor.` but processing is a very broad term, and what is processed are texts (spoken or written). Text is more or less clearly defined in Linguistics. 

> `Please read the Contributors Guide and refer the Contribution section.` to point in linking to both. Why even have a Contribution section then that just links to the guide.

I have to change this. But some duplication is useful since people do not read guidelines, being redundant doesn't hurt. 

> The repo title is very long. I would have done it the opposite way. Made the repo title use NLP and the readme title use the full title. Would also look better if the repo title was lowercased like most other repos. Preferred repo title: nlp-with-ruby

You're right, the way round is better! Changed.

> The top description should talk a little bit more what NLP is and link to a resource for the user can read more about NLP.

Actually  I don't see the point in general NLP introduction at this point. Users should be familiar with both NLP and Ruby before they look for Ruby focused NLP resources.

Failure to properly do so will just result in the pull request being closed and everyone's time wasted. Please read it twice. Most people miss many things.

- I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md) and the [instructions for creating a list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/create-list.md).
- This pull request has a descriptive title. For example, `Add Name of List`, not `Update readme.md` or `Add awesome list`.
- The entry in the Awesome list should include a short description about the list project/theme (not the list itself), and should be added at the bottom of the appropriate category.
- The list I added
	- **has been around for at least 30 days,**
	- is the result of hard work and is the best I could possibly produce,
	- is a non-generated Markdown file in a GitHub repo,
	- is not a duplicate,
	- includes a succinct description of the project/theme at the top ([example](https://github.com/willempienaar/awesome-quantified-self)),
	- includes a project logo/illustration (whenever possible) at the top right of the readme ([example](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron)). (The logo should link to the project website or any relevant website. The logo should be high-DPI, so set it to maximum half the width of the original image.),
	- only has awesome items **with descriptions** *(Awesome lists are curations of the best, not of everything)*,
	- contains the [awesome badge](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md#awesome-badge) on the right side of the list heading,
	- has a Table of Contents section **named `Contents`** as the first section,
	- has an [appropriate license](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md#choose-an-appropriate-license) *(Meaning something like CC0, NOT a code licence like MIT, BSD, Apache, etc)* *(If you use a license badge, it should be SVG, not PNG)*,
	- has [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md#include-contribution-guidelines),
	- doesn't include a Travis badge,
	- has been checked for inconsistent formatting, spelling, and grammar:
		- Each link description starts with an uppercase character and ends with a period.
		- Drop all the `A` / `An` prefixes in the descriptions.
		- Consistent naming. For example, `Node.js`, not `NodeJS` or `node.js`.

Finding content that is both relevant to the user, and has high topic relevance is the key point of research in this field.

> But I guess that would be very time-extensive, right?

Those lists were added before we became more strict on entry requirements, but yet they could do with some improvements if someone has the time.

As for this list:
- Replace the bolded text with normal text description and remove the divider at the top - they are distracting
- The contents shouldn't require a second level (below `Awesome SaltStack`)
- would move twitter feed under 'Community'

Some feedback:

- Should include a succinct description of the SaltStack project at the top ([example](https://github.com/willempienaar/awesome-quantified-self)).
- Should include a project logo at the top right of the readme ([example](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron)). (The logo should link to the project website. The logo should be high-DPI, so set it to maximum half the width of the original image.).
- Use the SVG version of the license badge. (See the one in this readme)
- `\[library-name\]\(link\)` => `[library-name](link)` Should also say `resource` and not `library-name`.

- I'd still like to see some blog posts / articles.
- The `Books & Videos` section should be split into two sections.
- `Contents`, `Libraries and Frameworks` and the other sections on that level should be `##`, not `#`.
- I don't see the point of the distinction between libraries and frameworks in `Libraries and Frameworks`. Just call it `Packages` and remove the `libraries`/`frameworks` postfix in the headings.
- Drop all the `A` / `An` prefixes in the descriptions.
- Include project logo in the top right, like e.g. https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron (The logo should link to the project website) (The logo should be high-DPI, set it to minimum half the width of the original image)

Once that list gets longer, I'm happy to split it.

No, they're top-level headings, so quality for H1.

In Java, libraries vs. frameworks are very different, so I'll keep the distinction.

I tried that, but didn't like the way it sounded.

I don't have the talent to create a logo. Don't really see the need?

You're supposed to create the best initial list as possible. People can add additional entries later, true, but you should be able to find some on your own. Awesome lists are hard work.

> Once that list gets longer, I'm happy to split it.

It's not the length. They don't make sense together. But doesn't matter as it seems you changed it.

> No, they're top-level headings, so quality for H1.

The top-level in all lists is the name of the list. Look at any other lists, or for that matter, almost any other readme on GitHub. For example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/react/master/README.md

> In Java, libraries vs. frameworks are very different, so I'll keep the distinction.

Good to know, but then they should be in two different top-level sections. One called `Libraries` and one called `Frameworks`.

> I tried that, but didn't like the way it sounded.

That creates inconsistency though, as some entries are without A/An, but could have had it. I'm sorry to be such a perfectionist, but I am. For example `Concise (micro-) framework for quickly`, could have been `A concise (micro-) framework for quickly`. All other lists follow this guideline of dropping A/An, so would be nice if you could follow too, to be consistent.

> I don't have the talent to create a logo. Don't really see the need?

The Java logo, not a custom one.

> When I find an awesome community exclusively for Java 8, I will add it.

Same as previous answer, go look. Should not be very hard to dig up.

> When it's failing, it indicates that there's a link that gets redirected, so when it's passing all is good.

When it fails you'll get an email, and when a PR fails it's shown in the interface. The badge has no purpose and only makes the list look more noisy.

This is fine in itself, but it's not relevant for denoting free-ness.  I can write proprietary software for Linux, or I can contribute to Notepad++ -- which is free software but relies heavily on Windows APIs so it's not really suitable for Linux.

Cool, that's fine.  My rationale is that free-software people are _really_ picky about their licenses; personally, I'd rather just slap a license on the list entry than potentially get some poor sap's hopes up until they click the link and see that the license isn't compatible with their project.

It's just in my personal opinion Postgres list is in a very good shape (in fact in a better shape than many others) with a lot of stars showing people's respect for the content. And the content is what matters most for awesome lists not the placement of the badge. At least that is how I see it.

- If you have experience with any of the libraries or resources. Please add a personal comment to the description about it. That's 100x more valuable than just a bunch of links.

- Include project logo in the top right, like e.g. https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron (The logo should link to the project website) (The logo should be high-DPI, set it to minimum half the width of the original image)
- Fix the merge conflict. (Don't open a new PR, just update this one)
- Drop all the `A` / `An` prefixes in the descriptions.
- Take a look at other lists for inspiration on how to improve yours.
- The contributing.md file is cleary just copy-pasted from here. Customize it to fit your list.
- There should be a succinct description of what FRC is and why I should care at the top of the list.
- The sub-sections in `Resources` should be top-level.
- The `(Electron/Node.js App)` part of `Scoutomic (Electron/Node.js App)` should be part of the description, not the title link. Same with all the other instances.
- If you have experience with any of the libraries or resources. Please add a personal comment to the description about it. That's 100x more valuable than just a bunch of links.

**[A curated list of Awesome WM documentation, themes and widgets. Awesome WM is a tiling window manager for Linux extendable via lua. Unfortunately lack of accepted conventions, poor out-of-the-box configuration, and several breaking changes to the WM throughout the years left the community fragmented and beginners frustrated. There are tons of widgets and plugins that no longer work but are still referenced in official wiki. Even something as simple as finding a working volume control widget ends up being a whole day activity. This list aims to remedy that by referencing widgets, themes and configurations that work with awesome 3.5.2 and above.]**

Awesome WM is a tiling window manager that I discovered a few years ago. At first it was very frustrating, until I discovered the right combination of widgets, plugins, and macros. Now I love my experience with it. Archaic codebase, abundance of broken widgets and plugins due to several breaking changes make Awesome WM really frustrating for beginners, this list attempts to remedy that.

Some feedback:
- `Table of Contents` => `Contents`
- Drop the Travis badge.
- Readme is missing a title.
- The `Resources` section should be a list, not headings.
- the `Resources` section should have a link to the main Elixir awesome list: https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir

## 

The Elixir Awesome list already has a Books section: https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir#books

2) :beer: The meetups idea is a good one too! Like an 'awesome workshop' for a perticular list where people can meet and talk about things related to the list. So for example the awesome-github-cheatsheet meetup at such and such bar or the 'Awesome-Macos' meetup. Or it doesn't have to be about one topic or list. It could be a meetup about a general topic or no topic at all is just as good too. I just think might be more successful if there was a topic or theme. Then perhaps if it kicks off nicely we can have an 'awesome-calendar' containing tons of awesome-events on a wide range of topics to choose from (hopefully) all around the world.

3) :mag: That [AwesomeSearch](https://github.com/lockys/AwesomeSearch) project is cool, I just saw that now. How about just expanding that or re-branding it so it's more then just search. Perhaps I'm wrong but it seems to already parse all the lists and has a pretty cool user interface to search. So what if you folks expand the list details.  Add a 'explore feature' perhaps the same sorta way [GitHub's explore](github.com/explore) repos works. Other things it could include is maybe screenshots of the links and some sort of stats. Using the GitHub API you could also pull stats from the repos. Web stats, top charts, trends, etc.

Add [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) to that list. It's cross platform and fast and we use it all the time with _amazing_ success. It's the only build system CMake supports out of box on all platforms.

- I was hoping that if I've missed a gem that should be there - the community would contribute it...

Not done.

Any reason for not using markdown? We prefer markdown as it's much easier to use and can mean that new contributors to awesome lists can get editing right away without learning complicated syntax.

769,2016-10-06 18:12:05,"@davisonio I've updated the 'Table of Contents' to just 'Contents', I'd missed that one when submitting this as I've been maintaining Awesome Textpattern for a while now and at the time the other Awesome lists all seemed to use 'Table of Contents' (and still do).

As for the use of Textile over Markdown the reasoning is basically the same as yours for using Markdown for the Awesome lists. Markdown isn't commonly used by the Textpattern community as the Textpattern CMS has always used Textile as it's main markup syntax and so is more familiar to its users. Switching the list to Markdown would add a barrier to Textpattern users to contributing to it and I'd rather make it easy for others from the CMS's community contribute to it.

@sindresorhus the en-dash is an unfortunate side effect of using Textile due to the way it gets rendered. As for non-plugin resources there are already a few listed but I've added a Community section and asked the Textpattern community to help expand this.

I do like to see more blog posts, tutorials, videos of talks, book, learning material, etc, being added though. Here's an example of how it's done: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron#documentation
- I would drop the `inspired by the awesome-php idea.` part. You can rather link to that list in a `Related` section at the bottom.

No, the reason it's small is because you haven't worked on it long and hard enough. Great awesome lists are hard work. You shouldn't expect to be able to just put up a quick list and have contributors do your job. Awesome lists are awesome from the start. External contributors are useful later on for contributing things you couldn't find.

- Descriptions should be in the format `Link - Description.`. Note `-`, not `:` and all descriptions should start with an uppercase character.

- Include project logo, like e.g. https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron

I agree with you, but that is more realistic in a niche like a programming language or framework. The QS space is very varied, so that criteria would limit the list only to professional reviewers when it comes to devices.

Currently the way I curate the list is by monitoring sites like the [QS Forum](https://forum.quantifiedself.com/), [AlternativeTo](http://alternativeto.net/), Reddit, and Quora. Based on suggestions, usage, and recommendations I try to gauge the strength of a technology or application.

The goal is to get some collaboration on the list (and descriptions) if there is enough merit to it.

There's a lot of items on this list which has clearly taken lots of effort to add here :smile: but they don't seem to be there in any structured way. Ideally there should be categories for the questions and a description why the answer is awesome and interesting.

I would also remove the separators - they don't look so great.

**Regarding the duplicate:** I am aware of the `awesome-answers` respository that you mentioned. But it solely focuses on programming related questions. My repo, on the other hand, tries to gather links from all disciplines. In fact, very few of the links in my repo are related to programming. So, there is less overlap between the two projects than the titles suggest. :smile: 

**Regarding the Structuring:** This was deliberately done. A lot of questions are general questions which are very hard to categorize (e.g: _What are the key traits of mentally strong people?_). They would all go into the **Miscellaneous** category if I try to categorize them. Still, to enforce some order among them, I have sorted all the questions in alphabetical order.

**Regarding the separators:** Removed them.

Update from original
",LeandroNovak,2016-08-21 15:10:30
748,2016-08-20 10:59:04,"Hi,

I just created a comment on another issue https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/718#issuecomment-241192281 stating frustration on awesome lists that have a large backlog of PR's that are waiting for weeks or months to be merged.

I would like to propose a change to the Code of Conduct and add something along the following lines:
- Potential awesome maintainers should be aware/warned that maintenance can be a time-consuming business, and they should be willing to spend it (within the boundaries of reason, of course).
- Awesome lists have gained traction, not only in open-source community but in broader IT world. It is used more and more as an authoritative source (well, that sounds a bit strange, given the laissez-fair approach it started out with, but still) in software selection and to proclaim new products, to raise awareness.
- Especially that last point leads IMHO leads to a new responsibility for the maintainer, namely to merge new entries within a reasonable timespan, or - if that is not possible for some reason - ensure there is another maintainer that can do the merging.

WDYT?

(PS And here I would like to state that this is not personal criticism on any awesome maintainer on the block, you are awesome together with your lists! I fully understand busy schedules and that time is scarce.) 
",aschrijver,
748,2016-08-20 11:06:05,"> Potential awesome maintainers should be aware/warned that maintenance can be a time-consuming business, and they should be willing to spend it (within the boundaries of reason, of course).

I kinda agree, but keep in mind that it's open source and usually done in people's free time. That being said, they should at least be willing to add people to help maintain the list.
",sindresorhus,
748,2016-08-20 11:16:47,"My point in case is that if an awesome list is _truly_ `awesome‚Ñ¢` then it is most likely to deal with an exciting upcoming technology. Very active community, the coolest projects popping up all over the place. And some of these projects wait for 2 months before popping up on the list that is designated for it, when meanwhile the hype cycle is passing fast and people made their choice already (I am exaggerating a bit, but you get the idea).

An awesome list that is not regularly updated is not following _the concept of awesome_ so to say, it deviates from the core idea. Therefore just like with inappropriate text, there should be code of conduct to help avoid a list of getting in this grey field of half-awesomeness.

Guess the tagline could be (no pun intended, rather a statement of 'brand quality'):

> Are you awesome enough to become one of our time-honoured list maintainers?
",aschrijver,
748,2016-08-21 00:08:15,"As a maintainer of a couple lists, I have to say that GitHub really doesn't provide me with enough tools to accomplish 0 PRs. Two of my biggest concerns:
- There is no way for me to preview the notification without clicking on it.
- If I click on it and don't act on it immediately, there's a huge chance that I'm going to forget that it was submitted. I cannot save it to act upon it later or something like that.

These constraints leave me with two options:
- Hope that the author of the PR is going to ping me after a certain amount of time.
- Manually open the lists I'm maintaining from time to time to see if I missed something.

None of these options are good enough, so by going with the second option, I sometimes stumble upon something submitted a month or two ago. In that case, I've probably accepted something else in the meantime, which results in merge conflicts, so now I have to ping the PR submitter and wait for them to respond, which sometimes happens, sometimes doesn't.

For these reasons, I'm against this change. I'm okay with removing lists that have like 25 unanswered PRs for months, but if there's one or two PRs that are not acted upon for like two months, I don't agree that such list should be removed.
",aleksandar-todorovic,
748,2016-08-21 00:31:47,"On the issue of disappearing notifications I already send a request the 3rd of August to [Github Support](https://github.com/contact):

> Hi Github team,
> 
> I could not find a feedback link, so assume this is the proper place for suggesting improvements to github.com
> 
> If you participate in many projects and therefore have a lot of participating notifications the notification disappear when you first read them. This might be from a mobile phone from the train. If you come home you have to go from memory to find those issues and PR's again and give a proper response.
> 
> The more active you are, the more of a problem this becomes. So now the best practice is either only read notifications if you have time to prepare a response, or carefully copy the URL and open in a new tab.
> 
> So an improvement would be either to have people explicitly mark their participating notifications as done / handled, or alternatively allow filtering on the activity log to see those notifications.

> That was it, thanks!

And got the following response:

> Hey Arnold,

> Thanks for reaching out. As someone who uses multiple devices myself, I can see how that would be useful. I switched back to email notifications for exactly that reason.

",aschrijver,
748,2016-08-21 00:41:29,"@aleksandar-todorovic Thanks for your feedback. I will remember to answer your other points tomorrow (its quite late now in Netherlands) and if I don't forget (the notification is gone now :wink: ).

Note however, that I am not in favour of closing a no-longer-maintained list down. That would sell `awesome` short, the technology and PR's are still relevant.

You could solve this by having the rule that a real `awesome` list maintainer must allow a second maintainer (maybe one from the list-of-lists maintainers) that is not involved in day-to-day merging, but takes ownership in the case of too long period of inactivity. If they don't comply they may not use the shield with logo, and are not included in lists-of-lists.

I don't know if one maintainer can disown another one with bad behaviour, just like you can reject misbehaved PR's, but that might be a sanction.
",aschrijver,
748,2016-08-21 00:47:26,"@danayel Is the Github feature request list you mentioned open to the public, as let's say a Github repo? I couldn't find it. Or is the form+mail-like way the recommended contact route? 
",aschrijver,
748,2016-08-21 09:58:14,"I think the best way to solve this is to ensure that there are multiple collaborators on awesome lists. If we find that all collaborators are inactive then either contact them via other means to see if they would consider adding someone else as a collaborator to help answer the PRs or start a fork and use that as the updated awesome list from then onwards (the latter has been done with `awesome-sysadmin`).
",davisonio,
748,2016-08-21 10:11:37,"Hi @aleksandar-todorovic I didn't go to sleep, worked all night, and so didn't forget to return to your issue :wink: but there were not that many points I didn't already respond to, I now see. And @davisonio you are right in stating that would be a working solution.

But I would still like to see some of this discussion reflected in the code of conduct. That should not be that much of a problem. These are in the end 'just' a list of moral guidelines not judicial requirements..

- In https://github.com/jagracey/Awesome-Unicode?#unicode-blocks, I would linkify each block to the relevant Wikipedia page: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_Supplement

Not done, the 'messengers' section would be good as a sub-category of the main contents page rather than the whole thing.

I think it would be good if this list had more ChatOps related resources (not just bots). e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/chatops/, community etc. and the items in the sub reddit sidebar. Is that something you would consider?

This is fine and well, but should also explain why I should care. What makes ChatOps awesome. The first ChatOps word should also link to a resource about it.

The list is full of adapters for various messengers, but how are those related to ChatOps.

`awesome-cryptography` is all about cryptography and encryption.

It has all started with [this issue](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/663). I have requested a new list about `encryption`, soon I have found [`retter`](https://github.com/MaciejCzyzewski/retter), which seemed to be an `awesome-cryptography` list. 

With all the respect to the author, his great work, and the content itself, `retter` is not an `awesome-list`. It is a collection of different implementations of cryptography algorithms in `C`, and a structured folder of bookmarks.

That was an original reason I have started my own list. But, I can also add the fact `retter` was not updated for 10 month now.

Things I have improved in my list:
- [x] Follows `awesome` format (""flat is better than nested"")
- [x] Has a bunch of integrations to keep people interested: [twitter](https://twitter.com/awe_crypto_bot) and [gitter](https://gitter.im/sobolevn/awesome-cryptography)
- [x] Integrated `remark-lint` with [a lot of style-checks](https://github.com/sobolevn/awesome-cryptography/blob/master/package.json#L31)
- [ ] `awesome-lint` [WIP](https://github.com/sobolevn/awesome-cryptography/issues/24)

I have not found any recommendations or rules about this particular situation. Anyway it is up to you to make the final decision.

I don't understand what this means. What is Cinema made with code? What is Cinema made for web? It needs better description.

## 

Good start, but needs a lot more work. More content. More context. For example, you've included `Falter Inferno`, but you don't explain why. For me now it's just a random list of links.

## 

It's not clear what the `Dependencies` section is. Could use a description. The items there also needs descriptions.

In the `Official resources` section there's no reason to prefix `choo`. That's obvious.

## 

In the readme description, linkify `choo` to its website.

`Official resources` should have a link directly to the choo repo.

I'm writing a prototype to let the community decide if a resource should be included to the list or not.

With voting, rarely. I don't think democracy is able to collectively reason about quality. Then it becomes more of a popularity contest. A person bothering to submit a pull request is a better metric.

That's actually what I want to avoid. I don't have much motivation to go through an enormous amount of components.

But there are many good components missing from the curated list.

So instead of creating a PR, a user would simply fill a form.
That would make adding a react component much easier.
Therefore many more good components could be collected that way.

> With voting, rarely. I don't think democracy is able to collectively reason about quality.

Initially my plan was to automatically git push to the curated list once a react component has received 2-3 approvals from peers. But you are probably right and instead I'm going to do a final review and manually git push the changes.

Thanks for the input.

(PS I am not blaming the nice chaps that maintain the awesome lists, I know times can be busy).

It could also be a done with a commit hook that checks on some criteria, like formatting and then auto-commits. Could have a filter as well, so it doesn't commit entries with expletive text or clear spam entries. If spam does get through the filter and is added this way, community can file an issue, and PR with removal.

True that!

> auto-commits

I wouldn't do that. Many requests are very low quality. E.g. I checked every component of the `awesome-react` list and 50% are bad and should be removed (see https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react/issues/503).

>  clear spam entries

I actually never saw that. From my experience, it's not a problem. The problem is well intentioned but low quality entries.

Changing the code of conduct as proposed in #748 would probably not address the issue enough. The bottom line is that maintaining a curation is lot's of work and changing the code of conduct will have only a small impact on how much time a contributor spends on his awesome list.

What do you think of making the whole community curate a list? If it works, then it would solve the problem.

@sindresorhus

Cases of ""wong"" upvotes: (I.e. when the community upvoted a new entry request I ended up rejecting.)
- I rejected 1 entry because of its bad quality. It got 1 upvote.
- I rejected 2 entries because of missing English documentation. That was the only reason for rejecting them. They got 1 upvote each.

All downvotes led to reasonable rejections.

Over the time, many programming languages, operating systems and frameworks added support for various DTrace probes and made problem troubleshooting available via DTrace. DTrace is a wonderful tool and more people should know about it and use it.

Not done completely. Note ""This includes starting each link description with an uppercase character and ending it with a dot"".

## 

Some nitpick:
- `node.js` => `Node.js`
- https://github.com/xen0l/awesome-dtrace/blob/master/LICENSE should include the actual license
- Drop `Awesome DTrace` in the table of contents (TOC) and give the TOC a top-level heading.
- I don't really see the point in mentioning this: `Layout inspired by awesome-python.`
- `Learn DTrace` => `Learn`
- Align the logo to the right `<img src="""" align=""right"">`.

The TOC is more verbose than useful. It's only meant to be a way to quickly scan and go to the main sections. Here's how I think it should look instead:

Neither this. Lots of inconsistent formatting. Be consistent about ending all descriptions in a `.`. The first character in descriptions should be capitalized. Use consistent naming of `Vert.x`.

I don't understand what we did wrong here. The repo has a license. It was one of the first things we added many months ago. Is it because it's the Apache License? This is the project's default license and it's not my call to change that. If that's the reason, then I need to talk to the project leads first.

I think that the awesome-react-components list should not include learning material. I would not merge both lists. They serve two distinct use cases;
- If I want to learn about React then I go to awesome-react
- If I write code and I need a specific component then I go to awesome-react-components

I like the idea of keeping things small, ""do one thing and do it well"".

Although, there are some components that are innovative and stumbling upon them represents a learning experience. That is actually what the creative section is about, https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components#creative-things. For example, when I first stumbled upon `react-virtualized`, I learned about the idea of lazy loaded tables. Therefore the creative things section would make sense in awesome-react.

Looking at the commit history, it would seem like this has only been up on github for 3 days.

Since the other list, https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react#components contains components I would consider this a duplicate because eventually the components list will just be a variation of the of the other. 

> Collaboration would be great

Yes! It would be really nice if your efforts were combined into that already awesome list of react stuff. The way you have categorized the components is great. It would be awesome if that categorization found its way into the `awesome-react` list. 

Whether I am learning react for the first time or a veteran using the list as a toolbox resource, having one one list is great for both cases.

Alternatively perhaps the `awesome-react` list can remove the components list all together and just link to your `awesome-react-components` list, but for that it would be nice if you merged any missing components into your list.

Yes, it's on GitHub since 3 days only. I've started creating it ~2 months ago though.
I've interpreted ""has been around for at least 20 days"" as ""has been alive for at least 20 days"". If it means ""has been public for at least 20 days"" then I'll uncheck the checkbox and close the PR.

> The way you have categorized the components is great

I see categorization to be super important.
Actually, I think that sections that have more than ~15 items should systematically be broken down into sub-sections.
And I could see that to be a meaningful rule for creating Awesome Lists.
@sindresorhus what do you think?

> It would be really nice if your efforts were combined into that already awesome list of react stuff

I'd love to ""join forces"".

> Whether I am learning react for the first time or a veteran using the list as a toolbox resource, having one one list is great for both cases

I struggle with the idea of having only one React list that includes both learning material and components.
Personally, I am more interested in the components part and less in the learning material part.
I can see other people to be also interested in only either one.
Having `awesome-react` and `awesome-react-components` would allow one to watch either one or both.
I'm considering implementing automated manipulations on the list (show number of GitHub stars for every component, sort components after repository creation date and GitHub stars, etc.). In that context it would feel cluttered to apply automation on only a subset of a huge list.

> would be nice if you merged any missing components into your list.

Yes. Although I consider some of the components to be low quality and I would discard them.

In principle, it should not be hard to write a small bot that runs e.g. on Travis CI to check:
- that all commit titles in a PR are not just ""Update readme.md"",
- that the repository is added at the bottom of a category, 
- that a new repository:
  - is e.g. older than 2 weeks,
  - contains the awesome badge,
  - contains a ""CONTRIBUTING.md"", and
  - contains a ""LICENSE.md"" or similar file.

Those are all mechanic checks that such a bot could carry out instead of a human being. Probably we can make this bot even react to the GitHub PR with an error message and even close the PR: personally, I would be quite ruthless when it comes to handling such inconsiderate PRs: if it is too hard to read some instructions, I am pretty sure it is too hard to maintain an awesome list.

The danger of this idea are false positives: people that are of good faith who get their PR closed because of this.

- ways around such a bot (I can think of a few myself), and
- ways to mangle their list such that a bot cannot decide whether a list is good or bad.

However, I don't think that would be a problem. I see such a bot as a spam filter. Even if it doesn't get rid of 100% of the problem, it still is an improvement: it could take over a few simple repetitive tasks such that we free some time and energy for the human review process.

Otherwise, I think an interesting list üëç.

Personally, I would format the entries a bit differently such that the titles stand out a bit more. Perhaps make just the title into links instead of putting `[pdf]` at the end.

I would also advise to use DOI links (e.g. `http://dx.doi.org/...`) where those are available. That will save you some headaches to keep the links from rotting. The ArXiv links are also quite stable, so those are equally fine.

Not at all. You should be the one who should be added to this list.

I see what the problem is from these commits:
- You originally created content here: September 26 2015 https://github.com/rahulkapoor90/awesome-windows/tree/51cbb5dd9748ab751d4f1aeb29c9c2e9360b72b4
- It was copied 4 days later by RiseLedger and looks very similar: September 30 2015 https://github.com/RiseLedger/awesome-windows/tree/b3b0ee2acf84f2b1c9d2f6d50d430552054077cc
- Also, as your content was licensed under CC-BY then RiseLedger should have credited...

@RiseLedger can you explain?

Else, I think the best thing to do moving forward is to add @rahulkapoor90's repository to this main list instead of @RiseLedger's considering the list that was created first with the original content.

671,2016-05-29 15:34:23,"First of all, your #326 has **NOT** been closed due to ""too little stars"" as you mention. Instead, it's the typical reason https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/pull/326#issuecomment-141786349:

> Wait at least a couple of weeks after creating a list before submitting to this list to give it a chance to mature.

By the way, the other list was not accepted at first for the same reason. However, @RiseLedger took the time afterwards to get his list included, while you did not. I suspect that is the reason your list is not included and his one is.

Next to the evidence of @davisonio that shows that @RiseLedger based his list on @rahulkapoor90's work, I found a verbatim piece of overlap (not just ""similar""):

This can be tracked back to 
- https://github.com/RiseLedger/awesome-windows/commit/ab5107450b7c367d5475dac0a08d56d7bd442bbe from September 28, 2015 (i.e. in @RiseLedger's original PR #341 from Oct 1, 2015), and
- https://github.com/rahulkapoor90/awesome-windows/commit/439b3d906b22aa2a9b9915923ef50832b8850b8d from December 23, 2015 (i.e. made after your PR #326 from Sep 20, 2015 √°nd after his PR).

Note also that the latter commit contains more verbatim fragments from @RiseLedger's repository without any attribution and a snarky comment on top.
_I.e. evidence that @rahulkapoor90 also plagiarized @RiseLedger's work._

Personally, I think that @rahulkapoor90's list needs a lot of work still:
- some links are wrong (e.g. Textual 5 (Mac OS X application) links to mIRC (WindowS)),
- some programs do not even exist for Windows (e.g. xScope, Pixelmator, ...) 

**TL;DR:** I think the best course of action is to decide among each other whether or not to collaborate (merge both lists, decide to maintain it together, ...). But I guess the best place for that is to open an issue either in your repository mentioning him or an issue in his repository.

Regardless of cross-plagiarism, I would advise against blindly changing the reference without further review of the quality of both lists and explanations of both involved.

I see however some overlaps at the beginning in **Terminal** and **Editors** categories.

and i even added this line -

671,2016-05-30 09:11:55,"@rahulkapoor90: I understand why you were angry/disappointed that somebody else did something very similar to your work and gets the credit.

However, in such cases it is often most productive to assume no malicious intent and just contact the other author, see what has happened, offer to collaborate and share the workload (because maintaining a good list is quite some work, as you have probably noticed) and share the credit.

What throws me off and looks like copying is the _identical_ wording at the top: `A curated list of awesome applications, softwares, tools and shiny things for Windows` in both repositories since the beginning.

While this could point towards @RiseLedger copying @rahulkapoor90 , I think the explanation is much simpler: both @rahulkapoor90 and @RiseLedger may have used the [same repository](https://github.com/iCHAIT/awesome-osx) as a starting point and inspiration: it also contains `A curated list of awesome applications, softwares, tools and shiny things for OS X`.

Technically, since that is a CC-BY repo, it should have been mentioned by both.
So I honestly believe that this is also a case of just two people working on something very similar at the same time, without any intent of profiting of the other's work.

I am glad to see https://github.com/RiseLedger/awesome-windows/issues/29 where I think further discussion is most appropriate.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION:
FalcorJS is a new category of libraries that help you make one model of your application everywhere (on backend and front-end at the same time). It's a revolution in terms of productivity boost for full-stack developers.

It has not been two weeks and you've not fully followed what's outlined in the instructions for creating a list.

Can you suggest a category name to put Falcor and GraphQL/Relay next to each other so a reader of your awesome list will know that these two tools are solving similar problems (which may be helpful when exploring).

What category name shall be for Relay/GraphQL and Falcor in your opinion?

P.S. OK, I will try to rename the repo name as suggested (if there will be permanent redirect for it, as the repo is already listed in several different resources so I don't want others to hit 404 error page because of that renaming).

## 

The list is not very comprehensive. Awesome lists are hard work. Just putting in a few links isn't very useful. It has lots of typos and inconsistencies. For example, `easy to use library.` is not a useful description. `JQuery` => `jQuery`. Put some more work into it. Take a look at some other lists and see how they do it. E.g. https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-electron https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-npm

## 

It also doesn't fully comply with https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/create-list.md

Some other things:
- You're very inconsistent about the naming. I've seen all of these: `Falcor Netflix`, `FalcorJS`, `Falcor`, `Falcor.js`. Pick one and stick with it. The official name seems to be `Falcor`, so I would use that.
- Clicking the logo should go to the Falcor website.
- There's not a single link to the Falcor website anywhere. I would linkify `FalcorJS` in `FalcorJS is a new category of libraries that help you make one`.
- `Examples` should not be under packages. It's not packages. It should be another top level section.

I think that makes it a bit of a maintenance nightmare. Perhaps it's better to just provide 1 link: back to the list that is one level higher in the hierarchy.

~~Also, while randomly clicking on a few links, I saw some dead ones, e.g. ""HP Unified Functional Testing (UFT), formerly known as (QTP)"" does not seem to work. So you might want to check for dead links as well.~~ Nevermind, it just took a lot of time to load.

I would like to request for adding a new list to the awesome list. This new list enumerates various websites where one can practice coding.

I created a [repository](https://github.com/hkasera/practice-coding) for the same and then got to know about awesome list. I think it would be great if this list can be a part of it.

Let me know if this is a welcome contribution!

Not necessarily, I think that mostly the awesome lists need to be monitored manually regularly to check that people's contributions are being taken into account.

The most useful thing to generate in my opinion would be to check for unreviewed pull requests.

Also, the repositories include in the list are curated software projects, maintained by people. They are only as awesome as they are actively maintained to keep things updated.

Some feedback:
- In the `Awesome Lists` section you're linking to too many lists. It's way too noisy. Pick the most relevant ones. No point in linking to every programming language list. `Awesome Awesomness` is no longer maintained and should be removed. `Awesome List` is already linked to in the awesome badge.
- The Table of Contents is too big. No point in listing sub-section. I would limit it to the top sections. Also give it a heading => `Table of Contents`.
- Resolve the open pull requests.
- I'd like to see some more blog posts and videos.
- Totally optional, but would be cool to have an illustration at the top. Here's a good example: https://github.com/websemantics/awesome-synthetic-biology
- End all descriptions in a `.`

You originally said to add this to the web development section, which doesn't seem to be there anymore. Added to front-end development section instead.

Let me know if any other changes are needed for addition.

I think you should keep the focus to Bootstrap themes and remove that note.

I don't see the point in the `link` column. Just linkify the title. I'd also like to see some more info about each theme. Are all of them free? Each item should include the license of the theme. A description would also be nice. The contribution guidelines should be in a contributing.md file.

The `Libraries` section should have their project description added so users can easily see what they're about. Items in the `People to Follow` section should have commentary on what they're relevant and should be followed. I would remove the `Other Awesome Lists` section. You already link to `awesome` in the badge and the two other lists are unmaintained and incomplete (you're not doing your users any favors linking to them). `What is Audio Visualization?` is good, but I would like to see a succinct one sentence explanation of audio visualization directly in the readme.

Some more things I'd like to see improved:
- Go through a fix all grammar and typos. E.g. ""create musics with this sequencer by Joe Harry."" `musics` => `music`.
- Capitalize the first character in descriptions. `an immersion to the space` => `An immersion to the space`
- Don't put newlines between items. Right now it looks very messy.

That's not a requirement, just a recommendation, especially for things that you have experience with. That's very helpful for users.

## 

In general though the list looks ok, but could use some work on formatting, adding descriptions to all items, and add some more learning resources (more articles). Many of the items uses incorrect naming, like `nodejs` => `Node.js`, `python` => `Python`, etc. No need to have the contribution guidelines in the readme, put them in a separate contributing.md file. The list is missing a license, which is clearly mention in the previously linked to [awesome manifest](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md#choose-an-appropriate-license).

569,2016-03-11 08:50:40,"Hi Sindre, Paul, great idea!

#### no markdown errors, consistent style

I believe [remark](https://github.com/wooorm/remark), the markdown processor, could help here. Probably though its [lint](https://github.com/wooorm/remark-lint) plugin, which checks patterns in markdown and triggers warnings. It checks for several possible style violations (e.g., emphasis markers, `*` or `_`), which each can be configured, turned on, or turned off. And, it supports external rules, for example: [`vhf/remark-lint-alphabetize-lists`](https://github.com/vhf/remark-lint-alphabetize-lists), which ensures lists are sorted properly.

Which brings me to a similar project, [`vhf/free-programming-books-lint`](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books-lint), which implemented the aforementioned rule. This project wraps remark and remark-lint and enforces the free-programming-book style in their [`.travis.yml`](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books/blob/83ad2ccb681432e79c808cfa5bb418ec84a8369b/.travis.yml#L5-L7) file.

P.S. also interesting: [`remark-validate-links`](https://github.com/wooorm/remark-validate-links)

#### table-of-contents

Maybe [`remark-toc`](https://github.com/wooorm/remark-toc), or of course one of the non-remark plugins if you want more control.

#### grammatically correct, no typos

Nothing good so far. I investigated this but there‚Äôs no good solution to implement this in a Travis task, yet. I‚Äôm half-way with n-spell, plain-JavaScript (Hunspell) spelling, which will make this possible. But I got bored...

You have one section called `windows stack overflows` and then `Typical windows exploits`. See the inconsistency? And Windows is a name and should be capitalized.

[Competitive Programming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)

I do realize there's a list under a similar name (Competitive Coding).  
However, I believe competitive programming isn't just about coding (think [Linear programming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) for example). On top of that, I believe that there's more than just knowledge. It's also about the community that revolves around it.  
In addition, I do not think it's quite possible to cover everything awesome with a one-article-link layout. There are way more sites with awesome resources.

I've been in the competitive programming scene for more than 10 years, and have also been digging good information for roughly the same time. I sincerely feel that my list would indeed be able to connect people to information.

This list I created also receives positive feedbacks.

Third of all, I absolutely do not see any point in having both of these lists here. We should definitely decide on one of them. 

---

Now, in my own opinion, I do think that your list is better suited to be included here, _however_, I don't think you played fair by telling your concerns here instead of first reporting them in the `awesome-competitive-coding` and at least trying to expand that list before you've decided to create your own version of a similar thing.

Here is the link to the [screenshot of our conversation](http://imgur.com/xyAjd6H).  
Not only did he not comply, but he also posted a second, duplicated thread ([Topic wise Coding Resources - Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/23204) to promote his list) - again without the referral link he agreed on. That made me believe that collaboration doesn't seem to be possible.

I am the other guy in the issue which the screenshot mentioned. I also have a list on this with my own ideas. I do remember another not pleasant story with @lnishan.

But honestly, these two lists(by @lnishan and @hkirat ) actually cover different sides of competitive programming, and in my opinion they are both awesome enough to be added into this list.

But @lnishan turned the conversation to the direction of separation and adding referral links.
I am still up for a merge of both these repos.

I said adding links **for a start** because I think it takes time for a real collaboration as the contents are vastly different. You didn't even follow our initial agreement. How would I expect you to do more?

The more serious part. You said you're still up for a merge, yet I do not see any activity on your repo. If you bother looking through literally anything on my knowledge section, you'll notice you have so many  more resources to add. I can name lots of topics you didn't manage to cover: bipartite graphs, planar graphs, matchings, linear programming, strongly/biconnected components. You also have many links pointing to the same website with simply a different keyword search.

But the real point I'm making here is, it's just not possible to cover it all. Let's also take [awesome-algorithms](https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms), [awesome-datascience](https://github.com/okulbilisim/awesome-datascience) for example (as these 2 are closely related to competitive programming). None of them categorize their contents by methods, because there are simply  too many.  Now it's true that competitive programming covers only a portion of them, but the same applies.

This is also one of my first attempts at contributing to the open source community, so I do try to be as careful and as cooperative as possible.

One of the reasons that prompted me to work on this new list is that: there is already a good amount of information available on the Internet. Before @hkirat 's list, there are other awesome curated lists already (See my [Knowledge](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming#knowledge) and [Open Courses](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming#knowledge) section). All of these are trying to cover the knowledge required in this scene.

Oftentimes I would feel that there's more to know (Some sites don't mention something while some others do) or perhaps Site A explains something better than Site B (not to mention this is personal preference). Therefore, there really is a need for a list to collect all the awesome resources.

I'm not sure what your aim is, but to really see what I mean, you can consider reading problems from regions around the world (ACM-ICPC). Europe in general lays more emphasis on mathematical foundations and thinking, whereas China focuses more on advanced data structures and algorithms. In the end, not even a website like [GeeksforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/) can cover all the knowledge necessary in the competitive programming scene.

I have been in the competitive programming scene for more than 10 years and have accumulated quite a few years of teaching experience (also me always being the team captain). Imagine you're a beginner who wants to step foot in competitive programming, which is in fact me 10 years ago. One without guidance would wander around not knowing where to start. In this case, it would probably be better to include easier contents. However, with the case of a reasonably seasoned person, he/she might find the list common sense. There's a seemingly impossible balance (if you will) if the aim is to have a list with solely knowledge for the general public.

One major flaw I just spotted, you list flow as the third item, and even put graph (DFS, BFS) beneath. Usually maximum flow and [Max-flow min-cut theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max-flow_min-cut_theorem) is lectured in the very end of an algorithm course because it is not easy. It would also be necessary that you put the prerequisites higher up.

At last, the decision is left for the management team ( @sindresorhus , @aleksandar-todorovic ).  
Whatever the decision is, I do want to thank you for the efforts. This awesome list is truly a fantastic initiative and has benefitted me greatly.

528,2016-02-11 15:38:45,"Okay, then this would be an issue depending on what you're aiming for as far as I'm concerned.

It doesn't make much sense unless we're aiming for a database/archive. Also, there are data structures with multiple names (eg. [Fenwick tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenwick_tree) is also known as Binary indexed tree). There are also extensions such as [Persistent segment tree](http://blog.anudeep2011.com/persistent-segment-trees-explained-with-spoj-problems/) (an extension from [Segment tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segment_tree)).

It will also not be a list to get people started because of how the topics are organized.

My honest opinion (no offense): There are still many other issues (eg. casings, wordings, inaccurate/inadequate descriptions, insufficient resources to support ... etc.) left to point out. I would suggest @hkirat to do a bit more research into the scene outside his nation first. As of now, there are at least twice as many contents needed to mentioned. A conservative estimate would be months. I'm sorry and afraid that I frankly do not have the time to talk through this ...

The list is not very comprehensive. Awesome lists are hard work. Just putting a few links without any context isn't very useful. Put some more work into it.

504,2016-01-25 19:40:20,"First of all, let me thank @sindresorhus and everyone else for your titanic efforts to make these lists so awesome, it is greatly appreciated!!!

The problem I'd like to address though, is a challenging task to keep the lists relevant as things can move very fast and projects become deprecated, obsolete, outdated, unmaintained etc. As an example I can mention [the list of AngularJS seed projects](https://github.com/gianarb/awesome-angularjs#seed-projects), many of which are sadly quite old and full of what nowadays considered bad practices.

Showing some of these old projects to a newcomer without proper warning can actually be considered **harmful**, as people can mistakenly learn some bad practices from there without being aware that they are. Especially with AngularJS this feels like a problem with people misjudging the framework based on the outdated information, when modern best practices actually solving many of those old problems. Given the current fast pace of the JavaScript ecosystem and the overwhelming and growing amount of information, this problem will likely only get worse.

On the opposite side, the most modern, recent and relevant projects can **sadly blend and get lost** amidst other older ones, making it hard for the reader, especially beginner, to find them.

So I'd like to suggest to discuss possible ways to mitigate this challenge, and help the reader by adding various meta-data beside the links that would help to decide which links to check first.

I have previously proposed [to timestamp the list entries here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs/issues/432) as one possible meta-data that may be easy to automate and @sindresorhus rightfully suggested it belongs here. It is based on the assumption that the resource was considered ""awesome"" at the time when the link was put and the reader would quickly see when that happened.

I think that would really help the reader with the type of resources whose awesomeness might change fast in time. I'm sure the author would not put many of those links now but wants to keep them for historical or whatever reasons. 

It is not a perfect solution and might not be so helpful for other types of resources, where other clues may be needed. However, it is a simple information that would keep things more transparent, and may have different use for different people. Also it would help the maintainers to feel less guilty and less responsible for the content by clearly saying how old it is.

As @sindresorhus [pointed](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs/issues/432#issuecomment-172311291), this metric may be flawed e.g. for `npm` packages, where other information could be useful such as:
- the number of downloads;
- the number of stars;
- the number of open issues;
- the date of the last commit;
- the size of the package with all dependencies.

Especially the package size with dependencies and how long it takes to download is what I found very hard to estimate in advance.

Of course, any meta-data generation should be fully automatic and should not add any burden to the author. If anything more can be done to save the author's time -- the better!
",dmitriz,
504,2016-01-25 20:00:52,"I agree with you here, it's sometimes quite a struggle to check through projects listed in awesome lists for something which you may want to use or learn about. You don't want to be using outdated projects which don't work with recent versions or you don't want to be learning things which are out of date.

I don't think that timestamping is the best possible option though, as @sindresorhus rightly pointed out. Some items on awesome lists are simple ""Done"".

My suggestion here is for awesome list maintainers or those who contribute to lists to check though items manually every once in a while to check the quality of the resource. Maybe we should have some guidelines based on project maintainers ensuring items in awesome lists **stay awesome**? :sunglasses: Essentially I don't think ""stars"", ""downloads"" or last commit date can show anything about how awesome a resource is - therefore **we'd need awesome list maintainers to check the awesomeness of items in the lists reasonably regularly and semi-manually**.

An example of this in action is over at [awesome-irc](https://github.com/davisonio/awesome-irc/blob/master/archive.md). Every once in awhile I review the items in Awesome IRC. If there are projects which are not deemed awesome anymore I move them into the archive.md file with an explanation as to why it's removed.

There are some scripts which can help us of course! [awesome_bot](https://github.com/dkhamsing/awesome_bot) is very helpful. If the link to an item is broken then it's obviously not suitable for the list anymore. This is the exact problem awesome_bot aims to solve.

Another main problem we have is when awesome list maintainers simply disappear or are too busy to review pull requests. Here's a crazy idea: how about we reccomend that awesome lists have at least 2 people with commit access?

> I don't think that timestamping is the best possible option though, as @sindresorhus rightly pointed out. 

Just so it doesn't get lost in the cyberspace, let me quote from what @sindresorhus [exactly said](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs/issues/432):

> I agree with the sentiment in theory, but for packages, using timestamp as a quality metric is flawed, especially in the Node.js world. ...
> ...

Whence the reason for this issue.

> Some items on awesome lists are simple ""Done"".

""Done"" as in ""I did it and now I don't care""? Then clearly this content cannot be considered of comparable quality with ones where the author makes efforts to keep the content up-to-date. And as reader I need a clue to tell the difference. Very valuable given the current information overload.

> My suggestion here is for awesome list maintainers or those who contribute to lists to check though items manually every once in a while to check the quality of the resource. 

It is hard for me to imagine how that would work at scale in practice. Manually going through hundreds of links requires a lot of time. It is honourable when people find the time to do it, to benefit community, however, it is not what the community should automatically expect or feel entitled to. And even if maintainers want to commit, it can put a lot of pressure on them and get them burned out and dropping everything else, if the overload gets too high. [You don't even need to search hard for an example.](https://medium.com/@AlissaSquared/for-some-background-i-m-a-web-developer-who-rarely-ever-has-time-to-work-on-things-yet-still-tries-e7e8b2ccc49d#.taocc1fol)

I am actually suggesting to look for ways to **make it easier, less of a burden, and less time-consuming** for maintainers, which, at the same time, would benefit the community the most.

> Maybe we should have some guidelines based on project maintainers ensuring items in awesome lists stay awesome?

It is always good to have guidelines, the more the better, no question about it. However, the guidelines have advisory role. They cannot replace automatic procedures that guarantee the outcome. 

> Essentially I don't think ""stars"", ""downloads"" or last commit date can show anything about how awesome a resource is - therefore we'd need awesome list maintainers to check the awesomeness of items in the lists reasonably regularly and semi-manually.

Here I have to respectfully disagree. Stars and downloads tell **a lot** about the quality, and, even more important, about the viability of the project in the future. People download and give stars for reasons. A popular project is more likely to stay more actively maintained even if the original leader drops out. In contrast, a less popular project can die for random reasons, with no one else willing to commit. If I am a reader trying to decide which project I want to use and invest my time in, this makes a big difference.

I find it honourable that you as maintainer take your personal time to manage your links and put some of them into ""archive"". However, I imagine this as a difficult decision as some people might not be happy seeing their projects boxed into archive. 

Imagine there is this new hot tool A and everybody is writing how much it is better than B that was so oh hot last year. :-) In reality it might be great for some use cases but not so for others. The author of B may rightfully think it is unfair, and even get irritated seeing it boxed into archive and declared ""not so awesome"". And if you don't want to offend anyone, you will wait till the project's quality really drops down enough to be removed. And again we are back to the same problem of many links of varying quality next to each.

That is why I think it is better for both sides to take the subjectivity out of the equation as much as possible and make it objective, transparent and automated. The timestamp, for instance, is one of those metrics. Even if you think it is ""flawed"", it is up to the reader to decide how much it is. Or it isn't. You as maintainer don't even need to worry about it. It is just an information for everyone to use (or not to use). 

**You don't even need to think about how useful this or that metric is. Your readers are grown up enough to figure this out for themselves. Give it to them, and they will use it the way they want and they will thank you for the choice.** ;-)

> There are some scripts which can help us of course! awesome_bot is very helpful. If the link to an item is broken then it's obviously not suitable for the list anymore. This is the exact problem awesome_bot aims to solve.

That is certainly useful idea but it raises few questions:
- How many maintainers are actually using it and how does the reader see this? Is there any kind of badge for it?
- Once the link is found broken, what are the actions?
- Are the links automatically removed from the list?
- Or perhaps project is moved elsewhere and simple search can uncover the new link? Is this process automated?
- What if the link is temporarily down for whatever reason?
- What if the link is intact but the content is still not so awesome any more?

> Another main problem we have is when awesome list maintainers simply disappear or are too busy to review pull requests. Here's a crazy idea: how about we reccomend that awesome lists have at least 2 people with commit access?

Indeed, this is very real problem. Not so much with pull requests that can be merged quickly but with manual quality checks that can take real time. It may indeed help to allow access to several people but even then it fundamentally remains the same human problem.

It is a real problem that is worth to have real thoughts about with real potential benefits imo.

Fair point here. I'd agree that stars can definitely give an idea of the project but we can't singularly sort/organise them by this statistic.

> I find it honourable that you as maintainer take your personal time to manage your links and put some of them into ""archive"". However, I imagine this as a difficult decision as some people might not be happy seeing their projects boxed into archive.

I'm glad you've brought this up. I'd rather not offend anyone and their project by putting it into an archive. Personally, I'll think of something different - such as showing that these projects are still awesome but just need a little more work to get onto the list. If I was organising a project and people were giving me valuable feedback and advice I'd really appreciate this. Even if it comes in the form of a short description in an archive-like file. Something similar to an ""archive"" could even bring positives - previously unmaintained projects could find new maintainers.

I don't think ANY metric can be used universally to solve the problem of lists gathering dust. Different communities just have different dynamics. And even within a community, often you need multiple metrics to find what you are looking for.
I myself, work in academia, where also tons of metrics are used to gauge the performance of researchers, journals, institutes, etc. The values can differ by orders of magnitude across fields and learning what is a good or a poor value, is something you only learn by being in the field.
Also, it gives a very one-dimensional view of ""popularity"", but often you rather want to see ""theoretical"" vs ""practical"", ""easy"" vs ""difficult"", things that are hard or impossible to capture in a metric.

Just to say: I think there is little merit in picking a metric at the top level and suggesting this to other repositories. You readers may eventually learn in their own field what a ""good"" or a ""poor"" value for a metric is, but that also takes quite a bit of experience: something you only learn by reading the actual items. So metrics do not help the novices to find good content, but rather help more seasoned users.

You don't even need to search hard for an example.

You say that maintainers already have a lot to do to keep track of their items.  I would even say that keeping metrics is not going to make the situation of a maintainer any better, but rather worse. Once you introduce metrics, you also need to keep the metrics updated.

Personally, I think the current approach of manual checking is fine. Moreover, if there is an involved community, this is something that the users will notice. E.g. if a link goes stale, I would expect the readers of that list to voice their concerns. The detection of basic problems (broken links) can be automated, but I think that is where it stops as well.

Some people use a CI server to run that script, this can be seen e.g. from a `.travis.yml` file or something similar.
While your questions regard `awesome_bot` (which only checks dead links and redirects), similar issues also exist for updating timestamps or other metrics:
- How big a change is needed to update the timestamp? 10 characters? 10% of the page?
- Where would you store the cached version of the page (to check whether the new version has changed)? How about copyright/IP restrictions?
- How to deal with pages that are redesigned (same content, different stylesheet)?
- How to deal with sites that are replaced (e.g. hijacked, removed and eventually replaced by spam sites, ...)? Those will differ a lot from the previous version.
- What if the link is temporarily down for whatever reason?
- What if the new content is not awesome?
- How often would you check for updates? Every day? Every week? Won't that clutter the history of the project with lots of automatic updates?

It cannot be avoided that there is manual work involved. I just have the feeling that keeping track of more things (even assisted with an automatic procedure), will just cause a lot more work for limited benefit.

Didn't realize size was a factor. Also, adding everything that **could** be on the list seems to go against the idea of a list being curated (in my opinion, if everything can be added, then it's not really an ""awesome"" list, a problem I see with some ""awesome"" lists), but this is your repo, so your rules. :ok_hand:

Again, not what I said. I'm asking for more content, not everything. You should still do strict curation. It's just that I really doubt you couldn't find a single good blog post, or more than 4 good libraries. Do some more work on it is all I'm saying. Awesome lists are awesome because people creating them are passionate about the topic and work hard on the list.

First, thank all authors of awesome list, it makes the world better.

I don't know that if there are similar projects for these.
I am trying to exact awesome lists into JSON in my leisure time(still working on it) and build a simple website for searching awesome. Hope it's a helpful thing :p

~~I am looking forward to someone to PR any awesome list in JSON format like this because the format of awesome lists are different so that it's not so easy to write a general program to extract them into JSON I think.~~

It's not an issue actually and can be closed undoubtedly. 
if you get interested, below is the repos:

We have decided https://awesomelists.top as our final domain name.

I feel like there is a place for my guide here. Hope you feel the same.

Regarding which section to put it in ... I put it in ""Learn"" since it really is introductory (very tightly curated so as to NOT be overwhelming). The other lists in the ""Machine Learning"" section are more exhaustive. So I think this belongs in ""Learn."" Let me know!

Some quick feedback:
- The awesome badge should link to this list, not itself. Clicking it right now just goes to the current page.
- You've listed two specification, but there no word on why Service Worker is there: https://github.com/pazguille/offline-first/blob/master/README.md#w3c-specification I know what it is, but many probably won't. I think it would be worth having a succinct description of why it's included.
- In the https://github.com/pazguille/offline-first/blob/master/README.md#who-to-follow section you list some Twitter usernames. Why should I follow them? What relevant do they do? That should be answered as a description for each user.
- MIT is a good license for code, but not for text content like this. See: https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md#choose-an-appropriate-license

I'm definitely not suggesting that GitHub is better than the other similar services, I'm just saying that we have decided to link the lists hosted here to make the contributing process as similar as possible across the material we're linking from here.

[Source](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/167)

I agree with him that this list should keep listing lists on GitHub instead of listing those on other services. As this list targets GitHub users, it seems rather silly to me to include the links from any of the GitHub alternatives. It's not that the alternatives are bad, it's just that creating _another_ user account to submit a pull request complicates the collaboration.

## 

The contributing guidelines are better placed in a contributing.md file, so it shows up when people open new issues / PRs.

## 

Why is it a fork of another repo?

## 

The repo name is too ambigious. Should be `awesome-mobile-dev` or something.

## 

Many of the links are completely useless as it stands:
- Tutorials 1
- Tutorials 2
- Codepath ios Wiki

Add a good description to each link, preferably with explanation of why it's awesome.

Awesome lists shouldn't just be a random link dump.

I dont think so. Each repo is the star with useful information
regarding a specific topic and it should stay that way, not clutter or
deflect attention to unrelated content - Ideally a badge or link to
external resources should be at the bottom or elsewhere pointing
people to additional resources that may be useful to them and yet
somewhat related to the main content that people came looking for.

1. [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
2. [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)
3. [Murphy's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law)
4. [Stockholm Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome)
5. [Flow - psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29)

Some of the things that are common about these entries are :-
1. Some of them are related to Programming, Open Source. (1, 2, 3)
2. All of them are one of `Adages`, `Aphorisms`, `Psychological syndromes`,
   `Psychological principles`.
3. They are easy to understand, and behavior starts to make sense after
   understanding their gists. (Especially with 1, 2, 4, 5)

I thought about naming the list :-
1. `awesome-behaviour` : Almost everything on the lit is related with behaviour,
   except for entries like 3.
2. `awesome-psychology` : Entries list 2 and 3 do not fit.

So, I would like your opinion on :-
1. **Does an awesome list feel justified?**
   
   I do believe that a list must exist that has a list of all these things. Although, I think that the content is very fragmented. As there are a lot of things that could be part of this list, and the list could probably end up being called `awesome-miscellaneous`.
2. **Do you think that Wikipedia is the right source to link to, for entries like above?**
   
   I am slightly uncomfortable about using WikiPedia as the only source, because content keeps changing, and there's no concrete verification of the information being entered. Would you rather that the list have a link to the Wikipedia page, alongwith the link to a paper/article in a respected journal / blog post by a respected person in the field, along with the entry? This would make the list harder to build, and accept contributions to, but I guess it would be worth it, as everything there would actually be _curated_.
   
   Of course, this list would be something that you can consume in your free time and get to know
   more, so, in that perspective, Wikipedia seems good enough.

P.S. I have read the [Awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md), and the contributing guidelines for some awesome lists. Yet, I remain indecisive.
",icyflame,2015-07-23 07:14:25
229,2015-07-12 15:48:42,"1. I think it's a good idea. Though I can see how easy it would be to lose focus and end up being a misc list. It will need a clear tagline and contributing.md of what's acceptable, but also a good judgement on PRs. It's important that the list not only contain a list of links but a good succinct description of each item and why you should care.
2. Wikipedia is generally an ok source. I think it should also come with other good vetted sources about an item, preferably something less dry and more easily readable than Wikipedia.

Imagine that you saw the list once, and you read all the links for a certain category. Then some new items are added to the list with the NEW emoji. Again, another pull request add some new items so this deletes the old NEW previously added.
Finally you come to this list to see what's new, and you will only find the new items from the last pull request, and not the previous new items.

This can be avoided in the way they are listed now, if an old visitor come to the list, they just look for the last item they remember remember they saw, and then continue reading the new items, which are the links below the last one they remember.

There's lots of post about it if you google it. But in short: The company is awful, they've screwed over developers many times, Titanium is a super buggy piece of crap, and they introduce more regressions than they fix. I got bitten by it by creating a couple of apps that used Titanium and wasted so much time on a gadzillion bug reports that went nowhere.

207,2015-06-25 00:18:40,"Here's my idea. Of course, you could improve the order a bit.

#### Only link to awesome content.

Don't link to everything people suggest you to link. Research it, find out if it's really awesome and include it if it is.

#### Request a personal comment on why something is awesome

It's not enough to just suggest something. You also have to say _why_ do you suggest it and how will the potential users benefit from consuming it.

#### Make it clear on what the list is about

Make sure your list covers a certain scope and nothing else.

#### Pay attention to the grammar

Please be sure that you do your best to keep the list grammatically correct.

#### Choose an appropriate license

See [Choose a License](http://choosealicense.com/no-license/) for more details. Keep in mind that if you haven't selected a license, it basically means the people are not allowed to reproduce, distribute or create derivative works.

**NOTE**: I did an interview with a GitHub representative about licenses that could be a perfect addition to this section. It'll be online in a couple of days.

#### Stylize your list properly

Create table of content, put a picture or two, organize the content into different categories.

#### Accept other people's opinion

If you're an owner of the list, respect other people's opinion. If there are plenty of users not agreeing to your decision, give it a second thought!

Defining what is ""certified"" needs to be a rfc-style decission needed a group of people.
Also calling it ""certified"" might be counterproductive by scaring maintainers and producing competition. A open and friendly group that could be joined on free will seems way more friendly to me.
