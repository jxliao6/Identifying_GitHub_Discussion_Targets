* changed to the CC0 license
* added community resources
* added GitHub topic tags
* Cleared up non-relevant material

I do however want to discuss the wording of `Libraries` over either `Modules` or `Packages`. I did get rid of `Framework` but if you do a Google search for ""WebGL Modules"" or ""WebGL Package"" you will not find anything. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WebGL_frameworks) even uses the terms ""Frameworks"", ""Libraries"" and ""Engine"" which is the common term among the community. I understand eliminating the ambiguity with two terms, but Library seems to be the term I feel best describes it all... Another idea I had was to poll the community as this list is for them more than anyone.

You come to no-login-web-apps repo, look up the index and quickly find something that works for you, out of the box. No logins, no registrations. Of course, if you will be doing this too often, you might want to create an account on that site.

> I honestly rather create an account in a great web app then use a crappy one without login

**From README:** Most of the apps mentioned here do provide some kind of a user account feature to save history and progress. But as already stated before, a user account is not necessary to use the main features of these apps.

Maybe I should add a marker for sites that allow logins ?

**Regarding the duplicate:** I am aware of the `awesome-answers` respository that you mentioned. But it solely focuses on programming related questions. My repo, on the other hand, tries to gather links from all disciplines. In fact, very few of the links in my repo are related to programming. So, there is less overlap between the two projects than the titles suggest. :smile: 

**Regarding the Structuring:** This was deliberately done. A lot of questions are general questions which are very hard to categorize (e.g: _What are the key traits of mentally strong people?_). They would all go into the **Miscellaneous** category if I try to categorize them. Still, to enforce some order among them, I have sorted all the questions in alphabetical order.

**Regarding the separators:** Removed them.

Note however, that I am not in favour of closing a no-longer-maintained list down. That would sell `awesome` short, the technology and PR's are still relevant.

You could solve this by having the rule that a real `awesome` list maintainer must allow a second maintainer (maybe one from the list-of-lists maintainers) that is not involved in day-to-day merging, but takes ownership in the case of too long period of inactivity. If they don't comply they may not use the shield with logo, and are not included in lists-of-lists.

I don't know if one maintainer can disown another one with bad behaviour, just like you can reject misbehaved PR's, but that might be a sanction.

I think that the awesome-react-components list should not include learning material. I would not merge both lists. They serve two distinct use cases;
- If I want to learn about React then I go to awesome-react
- If I write code and I need a specific component then I go to awesome-react-components

I like the idea of keeping things small, ""do one thing and do it well"".

Although, there are some components that are innovative and stumbling upon them represents a learning experience. That is actually what the creative section is about, https://github.com/brillout/awesome-react-components#creative-things. For example, when I first stumbled upon `react-virtualized`, I learned about the idea of lazy loaded tables. Therefore the creative things section would make sense in awesome-react.

Since the other list, https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react#components contains components I would consider this a duplicate because eventually the components list will just be a variation of the of the other. 

> Collaboration would be great

Yes! It would be really nice if your efforts were combined into that already awesome list of react stuff. The way you have categorized the components is great. It would be awesome if that categorization found its way into the `awesome-react` list. 

Whether I am learning react for the first time or a veteran using the list as a toolbox resource, having one one list is great for both cases.

Alternatively perhaps the `awesome-react` list can remove the components list all together and just link to your `awesome-react-components` list, but for that it would be nice if you merged any missing components into your list.

Yes, it's on GitHub since 3 days only. I've started creating it ~2 months ago though.
I've interpreted ""has been around for at least 20 days"" as ""has been alive for at least 20 days"". If it means ""has been public for at least 20 days"" then I'll uncheck the checkbox and close the PR.

> The way you have categorized the components is great

I see categorization to be super important.
Actually, I think that sections that have more than ~15 items should systematically be broken down into sub-sections.
And I could see that to be a meaningful rule for creating Awesome Lists.

I'd love to ""join forces"".

> Whether I am learning react for the first time or a veteran using the list as a toolbox resource, having one one list is great for both cases

I struggle with the idea of having only one React list that includes both learning material and components.
Personally, I am more interested in the components part and less in the learning material part.
I can see other people to be also interested in only either one.
Having `awesome-react` and `awesome-react-components` would allow one to watch either one or both.
I'm considering implementing automated manipulations on the list (show number of GitHub stars for every component, sort components after repository creation date and GitHub stars, etc.). In that context it would feel cluttered to apply automation on only a subset of a huge list.

> would be nice if you merged any missing components into your list.

Yes. Although I consider some of the components to be low quality and I would discard them.

The only thing that has to change is the license: MIT is a code license, so not really appropriate for a list (sorry, I didn't spot that one earlier on).

I would suggest one of the following [CC licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/):
- CC0: most permissive (basically public domain, so you relinquish copyright)
- CC-BY: requires others to cite your list

As far as I see, all other requirements (badge, contributing.md, age of the list (when taking both old lists into account), ...) are satisfied.

683,2016-06-09 16:16:59,"@sindresorhus I am sure that people will find both
- ways around such a bot (I can think of a few myself), and
- ways to mangle their list such that a bot cannot decide whether a list is good or bad.

However, I don't think that would be a problem. I see such a bot as a spam filter. Even if it doesn't get rid of 100% of the problem, it still is an improvement: it could take over a few simple repetitive tasks such that we free some time and energy for the human review process.

Not at all. You should be the one who should be added to this list.

I see what the problem is from these commits:
- You originally created content here: September 26 2015 https://github.com/rahulkapoor90/awesome-windows/tree/51cbb5dd9748ab751d4f1aeb29c9c2e9360b72b4
- It was copied 4 days later by RiseLedger and looks very similar: September 30 2015 https://github.com/RiseLedger/awesome-windows/tree/b3b0ee2acf84f2b1c9d2f6d50d430552054077cc
- Also, as your content was licensed under CC-BY then RiseLedger should have credited...

@RiseLedger can you explain?

Else, I think the best thing to do moving forward is to add @rahulkapoor90's repository to this main list instead of @RiseLedger's considering the list that was created first with the original content.

671,2016-05-29 15:34:23,"First of all, your #326 has **NOT** been closed due to ""too little stars"" as you mention. Instead, it's the typical reason https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/pull/326#issuecomment-141786349:

> Wait at least a couple of weeks after creating a list before submitting to this list to give it a chance to mature.

By the way, the other list was not accepted at first for the same reason. However, @RiseLedger took the time afterwards to get his list included, while you did not. I suspect that is the reason your list is not included and his one is.

Next to the evidence of @davisonio that shows that @RiseLedger based his list on @rahulkapoor90's work, I found a verbatim piece of overlap (not just ""similar""):

Note also that the latter commit contains more verbatim fragments from @RiseLedger's repository without any attribution and a snarky comment on top.
_I.e. evidence that @rahulkapoor90 also plagiarized @RiseLedger's work._

Personally, I think that @rahulkapoor90's list needs a lot of work still:
- some links are wrong (e.g. Textual 5 (Mac OS X application) links to mIRC (WindowS)),
- some programs do not even exist for Windows (e.g. xScope, Pixelmator, ...) 

**TL;DR:** I think the best course of action is to decide among each other whether or not to collaborate (merge both lists, decide to maintain it together, ...). But I guess the best place for that is to open an issue either in your repository mentioning him or an issue in his repository.

Regardless of cross-plagiarism, I would advise against blindly changing the reference without further review of the quality of both lists and explanations of both involved.

However, in such cases it is often most productive to assume no malicious intent and just contact the other author, see what has happened, offer to collaborate and share the workload (because maintaining a good list is quite some work, as you have probably noticed) and share the credit.

What throws me off and looks like copying is the _identical_ wording at the top: `A curated list of awesome applications, softwares, tools and shiny things for Windows` in both repositories since the beginning.

While this could point towards @RiseLedger copying @rahulkapoor90 , I think the explanation is much simpler: both @rahulkapoor90 and @RiseLedger may have used the [same repository](https://github.com/iCHAIT/awesome-osx) as a starting point and inspiration: it also contains `A curated list of awesome applications, softwares, tools and shiny things for OS X`.

I think it'd be symbiotic addition - you could benefit from a powerful CMS / app sdk exposure, and we could benefit from your exposure which will only help grow the community as a whole.

Before @hkirat 's list, there are other awesome curated lists already (See my [Knowledge](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming#knowledge) and [Open Courses](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming#knowledge) section). All of these are trying to cover the knowledge required in this scene.

Oftentimes I would feel that there's more to know (Some sites don't mention something while some others do) or perhaps Site A explains something better than Site B (not to mention this is personal preference). Therefore, there really is a need for a list to collect all the awesome resources.

I'm not sure what your aim is, but to really see what I mean, you can consider reading problems from regions around the world (ACM-ICPC).

Imagine you're a beginner who wants to step foot in competitive programming, which is in fact me 10 years ago. One without guidance would wander around not knowing where to start. In this case, it would probably be better to include easier contents. However, with the case of a reasonably seasoned person, he/she might find the list common sense.

> I don't think that timestamping is the best possible option though, as @sindresorhus rightly pointed out. 

Just so it doesn't get lost in the cyberspace, let me quote from what @sindresorhus [exactly said](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs/issues/432):

> I agree with the sentiment in theory, but for packages, using timestamp as a quality metric is flawed, especially in the Node.js world. ...
> ...
> I do see this being useful for lists for projects with high churn, like JS frameworks, or where the author isn't able to ensure high quality. Can you open this issue on https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome instead with your above comment as issue description? ...

Whence the reason for this issue.

> Some items on awesome lists are simple ""Done"".

""Done"" as in ""I did it and now I don't care""? Then clearly this content cannot be considered of comparable quality with ones where the author makes efforts to keep the content up-to-date. And as reader I need a clue to tell the difference. Very valuable given the current information overload.

> My suggestion here is for awesome list maintainers or those who contribute to lists to check though items manually every once in a while to check the quality of the resource. 

It is hard for me to imagine how that would work at scale in practice. Manually going through hundreds of links requires a lot of time. It is honourable when people find the time to do it, to benefit community, however, it is not what the community should automatically expect or feel entitled to. And even if maintainers want to commit, it can put a lot of pressure on them and get them burned out and dropping everything else, if the overload gets too high. [You don't even need to search hard for an example.](https://medium.com/@AlissaSquared/for-some-background-i-m-a-web-developer-who-rarely-ever-has-time-to-work-on-things-yet-still-tries-e7e8b2ccc49d#.taocc1fol)

I am actually suggesting to look for ways to **make it easier, less of a burden, and less time-consuming** for maintainers, which, at the same time, would benefit the community the most.

> Maybe we should have some guidelines based on project maintainers ensuring items in awesome lists stay awesome?

It is always good to have guidelines, the more the better, no question about it. However, the guidelines have advisory role. They cannot replace automatic procedures that guarantee the outcome. 

> Essentially I don't think ""stars"", ""downloads"" or last commit date can show anything about how awesome a resource is - therefore we'd need awesome list maintainers to check the awesomeness of items in the lists reasonably regularly and semi-manually.

Here I have to respectfully disagree. Stars and downloads tell **a lot** about the quality, and, even more important, about the viability of the project in the future. People download and give stars for reasons. A popular project is more likely to stay more actively maintained even if the original leader drops out. In contrast, a less popular project can die for random reasons, with no one else willing to commit. If I am a reader trying to decide which project I want to use and invest my time in, this makes a big difference.

I find it honourable that you as maintainer take your personal time to manage your links and put some of them into ""archive"". However, I imagine this as a difficult decision as some people might not be happy seeing their projects boxed into archive. 

Imagine there is this new hot tool A and everybody is writing how much it is better than B that was so oh hot last year. :-) In reality it might be great for some use cases but not so for others. The author of B may rightfully think it is unfair, and even get irritated seeing it boxed into archive and declared ""not so awesome"". And if you don't want to offend anyone, you will wait till the project's quality really drops down enough to be removed. And again we are back to the same problem of many links of varying quality next to each.

That is why I think it is better for both sides to take the subjectivity out of the equation as much as possible and make it objective, transparent and automated. The timestamp, for instance, is one of those metrics. Even if you think it is ""flawed"", it is up to the reader to decide how much it is. Or it isn't. You as maintainer don't even need to worry about it. It is just an information for everyone to use (or not to use). 

**You don't even need to think about how useful this or that metric is. Your readers are grown up enough to figure this out for themselves. Give it to them, and they will use it the way they want and they will thank you for the choice.** ;-)

> There are some scripts which can help us of course! awesome_bot is very helpful. If the link to an item is broken then it's obviously not suitable for the list anymore. This is the exact problem awesome_bot aims to solve.

That is certainly useful idea but it raises few questions:
- How many maintainers are actually using it and how does the reader see this? Is there any kind of badge for it?
- Once the link is found broken, what are the actions?
- Are the links automatically removed from the list?
- Or perhaps project is moved elsewhere and simple search can uncover the new link? Is this process automated?
- What if the link is temporarily down for whatever reason?
- What if the link is intact but the content is still not so awesome any more?

> Another main problem we have is when awesome list maintainers simply disappear or are too busy to review pull requests. Here's a crazy idea: how about we reccomend that awesome lists have at least 2 people with commit access?

Indeed, this is very real problem. Not so much with pull requests that can be merged quickly but with manual quality checks that can take real time. It may indeed help to allow access to several people but even then it fundamentally remains the same human problem.

It is a real problem that is worth to have real thoughts about with real potential benefits imo.

I don't think ANY metric can be used universally to solve the problem of lists gathering dust. Different communities just have different dynamics. And even within a community, often you need multiple metrics to find what you are looking for.
I myself, work in academia, where also tons of metrics are used to gauge the performance of researchers, journals, institutes, etc. The values can differ by orders of magnitude across fields and learning what is a good or a poor value, is something you only learn by being in the field.
Also, it gives a very one-dimensional view of ""popularity"", but often you rather want to see ""theoretical"" vs ""practical"", ""easy"" vs ""difficult"", things that are hard or impossible to capture in a metric.

Just to say: I think there is little merit in picking a metric at the top level and suggesting this to other repositories. You readers may eventually learn in their own field what a ""good"" or a ""poor"" value for a metric is, but that also takes quite a bit of experience: something you only learn by reading the actual items. So metrics do not help the novices to find good content, but rather help more seasoned users.

You don't even need to search hard for an example.

You say that maintainers already have a lot to do to keep track of their items.  I would even say that keeping metrics is not going to make the situation of a maintainer any better, but rather worse. Once you introduce metrics, you also need to keep the metrics updated.

Personally, I think the current approach of manual checking is fine. Moreover, if there is an involved community, this is something that the users will notice. E.g. if a link goes stale, I would expect the readers of that list to voice their concerns. The detection of basic problems (broken links) can be automated, but I think that is where it stops as well.

Some people use a CI server to run that script, this can be seen e.g. from a `.travis.yml` file or something similar.
While your questions regard `awesome_bot` (which only checks dead links and redirects), similar issues also exist for updating timestamps or other metrics:
- How big a change is needed to update the timestamp? 10 characters? 10% of the page?
- Where would you store the cached version of the page (to check whether the new version has changed)? How about copyright/IP restrictions?
- How to deal with pages that are redesigned (same content, different stylesheet)?
- How to deal with sites that are replaced (e.g. hijacked, removed and eventually replaced by spam sites, ...)? Those will differ a lot from the previous version.
- What if the link is temporarily down for whatever reason?
- What if the new content is not awesome?
- How often would you check for updates? Every day? Every week? Won't that clutter the history of the project with lots of automatic updates?

It cannot be avoided that there is manual work involved. I just have the feeling that keeping track of more things (even assisted with an automatic procedure), will just cause a lot more work for limited benefit.

> I see what you mean by the questions you mentioned. Most of the answers from my point of view are ""check/do it manually"" unfortunately. But let's not forget that these are ""curated lists of awesome"", we shouldn't leave robots to completely run and ensure the validity for links in projects :smile:

I agree with this: let bots/scripts help with the work, but it remains essentially manual work since there is no bot that can check ""is X awesome?"". Awesomeness will always remain a subjective matter.

Is there an objection to a bot if one gets built by someone (say if I have some spare time?)

Edit: the reason I bring this up is because it's something we've talked about a lot at [opensourcedesign](https://github.com/opensourcedesign/) which has various websites kind of running in similar ways.

In my opinion, this should be an addition to an issue #266 (but that issue will need to be resolved first). I honestly think that creating a couple of pictures into `contributing.md` is all that is needed.

@simonv3 Of course there is. The point of the awesome lists is to _only_ include awesome content and tell others why that content is awesome. If your bot is not an AGI, that won't work. :wink:

269,2015-08-13 16:44:12,"@aleksandar-todorovic You could have people include why they think something is awesome via the bots PR? The bot wouldn't automatically just include links.

Pictures would probably go a long way. You could also just link to one contribute.md file from the list (rather than setting up a website). But anyway - doesn't the gh-pages branch automatically create a website for any root level .md files? `website.github.com/readme`?

I dont think so. Each repo is the star with useful information
regarding a specific topic and it should stay that way, not clutter or
deflect attention to unrelated content - Ideally a badge or link to
external resources should be at the bottom or elsewhere pointing
people to additional resources that may be useful to them and yet
somewhat related to the main content that people came looking for.

Additionally you currently require users to edit the data file. This makes it a lot harder to contribute as users will now how to edit both that one and the readme.

Defining what is ""certified"" needs to be a rfc-style decission needed a group of people.

Not at all. You should be the one who should be added to this list.

I see what the problem is from these commits:
- You originally created content here: September 26 2015 https://github.com/rahulkapoor90/awesome-windows/tree/51cbb5dd9748ab751d4f1aeb29c9c2e9360b72b4

- Also, as your content was licensed under CC-BY then RiseLedger should have credited...

@RiseLedger can you explain?

671,2016-05-29 15:34:23,"First of all, your #326 has **NOT** been closed due to ""too little stars"" as you mention. Instead, it's the typical reason https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/pull/326#issuecomment-141786349:

By the way, the other list was not accepted at first for the same reason. However, @RiseLedger took the time afterwards to get his list included, while you did not. I suspect that is the reason your list is not included and his one is.

Next to the evidence of @davisonio that shows that @RiseLedger based his list on @rahulkapoor90's work, I found a verbatim piece of overlap (not just ""similar""):

This can be tracked back to

- https://github.com/rahulkapoor90/awesome-windows/commit/439b3d906b22aa2a9b9915923ef50832b8850b8d from December 23, 2015 (i.e. made after your PR #326 from Sep 20, 2015 ánd after his PR).

Note also that the latter commit contains more verbatim fragments from @RiseLedger's repository without any attribution and a snarky comment on top.
_I.e. evidence that @rahulkapoor90 also plagiarized @RiseLedger's work._

Personally, I think that @rahulkapoor90's list needs a lot of work still:
- some links are wrong (e.g. Textual 5 (Mac OS X application) links to mIRC (WindowS)),
- some programs do not even exist for Windows (e.g. xScope, Pixelmator, ...) 

**TL;DR:** I think the best course of action is to decide among each other whether or not to collaborate (merge both lists, decide to maintain it together, ...). But I guess the best place for that is to open an issue either in your repository mentioning him or an issue in his repository.

Regardless of cross-plagiarism, I would advise against blindly changing the reference without further review of the quality of both lists and explanations of both involved.

This is also one of my first attempts at contributing to the open source community, so I do try to be as careful and as cooperative as possible.

One of the reasons that prompted me to work on this new list is that: there is already a good amount of information available on the Internet. Before @hkirat 's list, there are other awesome curated lists already (See my [Knowledge](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming#knowledge) and [Open Courses](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming#knowledge) section). All of these are trying to cover the knowledge required in this scene.

Oftentimes I would feel that there's more to know (Some sites don't mention something while some others do) or perhaps Site A explains something better than Site B (not to mention this is personal preference). Therefore, there really is a need for a list to collect all the awesome resources.

I'm not sure what your aim is, but to really see what I mean, you can consider reading problems from regions around the world (ACM-ICPC). Europe in general lays more emphasis on mathematical foundations and thinking, whereas China focuses more on advanced data structures and algorithms. In the end, not even a website like [GeeksforGeeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/) can cover all the knowledge necessary in the competitive programming scene.

I have been in the competitive programming scene for more than 10 years and have accumulated quite a few years of teaching experience (also me always being the team captain). Imagine you're a beginner who wants to step foot in competitive programming, which is in fact me 10 years ago. One without guidance would wander around not knowing where to start. In this case, it would probably be better to include easier contents. However, with the case of a reasonably seasoned person, he/she might find the list common sense. There's a seemingly impossible balance (if you will) if the aim is to have a list with solely knowledge for the general public.

One major flaw I just spotted, you list flow as the third item, and even put graph (DFS, BFS) beneath. Usually maximum flow and [Max-flow min-cut theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max-flow_min-cut_theorem) is lectured in the very end of an algorithm course because it is not easy. It would also be necessary that you put the prerequisites higher up.

At last, the decision is left for the management team ( @sindresorhus , @aleksandar-todorovic ).  
Whatever the decision is, I do want to thank you for the efforts. This awesome list is truly a fantastic initiative and has benefitted me greatly.

504,2016-01-25 19:40:20,"First of all, let me thank @sindresorhus and everyone else for your titanic efforts to make these lists so awesome, it is greatly appreciated!!!

The problem I'd like to address though, is a challenging task to keep the lists relevant as things can move very fast and projects become deprecated, obsolete, outdated, unmaintained etc. As an example I can mention [the list of AngularJS seed projects](https://github.com/gianarb/awesome-angularjs#seed-projects), many of which are sadly quite old and full of what nowadays considered bad practices.

Showing some of these old projects to a newcomer without proper warning can actually be considered **harmful**, as people can mistakenly learn some bad practices from there without being aware that they are. Especially with AngularJS this feels like a problem with people misjudging the framework based on the outdated information, when modern best practices actually solving many of those old problems. Given the current fast pace of the JavaScript ecosystem and the overwhelming and growing amount of information, this problem will likely only get worse.

On the opposite side, the most modern, recent and relevant projects can **sadly blend and get lost** amidst other older ones, making it hard for the reader, especially beginner, to find them.

So I'd like to suggest to discuss possible ways to mitigate this challenge, and help the reader by adding various meta-data beside the links that would help to decide which links to check first.

I have previously proposed [to timestamp the list entries here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs/issues/432) as one possible meta-data that may be easy to automate and @sindresorhus rightfully suggested it belongs here. It is based on the assumption that the resource was considered ""awesome"" at the time when the link was put and the reader would quickly see when that happened.

I think that would really help the reader with the type of resources whose awesomeness might change fast in time. I'm sure the author would not put many of those links now but wants to keep them for historical or whatever reasons. 

It is not a perfect solution and might not be so helpful for other types of resources, where other clues may be needed. However, it is a simple information that would keep things more transparent, and may have different use for different people. Also it would help the maintainers to feel less guilty and less responsible for the content by clearly saying how old it is.

As @sindresorhus [pointed](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs/issues/432#issuecomment-172311291), this metric may be flawed e.g. for `npm` packages, where other information could be useful such as:
- the number of downloads;
- the number of stars;
- the number of open issues;
- the date of the last commit;
- the size of the package with all dependencies.

Especially the package size with dependencies and how long it takes to download is what I found very hard to estimate in advance.

Of course, any meta-data generation should be fully automatic and should not add any burden to the author. If anything more can be done to save the author's time -- the better!
",dmitriz,sindresorhus
504,2016-01-25 20:00:52,"I agree with you here, it's sometimes quite a struggle to check through projects listed in awesome lists for something which you may want to use or learn about. You don't want to be using outdated projects which don't work with recent versions or you don't want to be learning things which are out of date.

I don't think that timestamping is the best possible option though, as @sindresorhus rightly pointed out. Some items on awesome lists are simple ""Done"".

My suggestion here is for awesome list maintainers or those who contribute to lists to check though items manually every once in a while to check the quality of the resource. Maybe we should have some guidelines based on project maintainers ensuring items in awesome lists **stay awesome**? :sunglasses: Essentially I don't think ""stars"", ""downloads"" or last commit date can show anything about how awesome a resource is - therefore **we'd need awesome list maintainers to check the awesomeness of items in the lists reasonably regularly and semi-manually**.

An example of this in action is over at [awesome-irc](https://github.com/davisonio/awesome-irc/blob/master/archive.md). Every once in awhile I review the items in Awesome IRC. If there are projects which are not deemed awesome anymore I move them into the archive.md file with an explanation as to why it's removed.

There are some scripts which can help us of course! [awesome_bot](https://github.com/dkhamsing/awesome_bot) is very helpful. If the link to an item is broken then it's obviously not suitable for the list anymore. This is the exact problem awesome_bot aims to solve.

504,2016-01-26 20:05:25,"Thanks @davisonio for extensive comments!

> I don't think that timestamping is the best possible option though, as @sindresorhus rightly pointed out. 

Just so it doesn't get lost in the cyberspace, let me quote from what @sindresorhus [exactly said](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs/issues/432):

> I agree with the sentiment in theory, but for packages, using timestamp as a quality metric is flawed, especially in the Node.js world. ...
> ...
> I do see this being useful for lists for projects with high churn, like JS frameworks, or where the author isn't able to ensure high quality. Can you open this issue on https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome instead with your above comment as issue description? ...

Whence the reason for this issue.

> Some items on awesome lists are simple ""Done"".

""Done"" as in ""I did it and now I don't care""? Then clearly this content cannot be considered of comparable quality with ones where the author makes efforts to keep the content up-to-date. And as reader I need a clue to tell the difference. Very valuable given the current information overload.

> My suggestion here is for awesome list maintainers or those who contribute to lists to check though items manually every once in a while to check the quality of the resource. 

It is hard for me to imagine how that would work at scale in practice. Manually going through hundreds of links requires a lot of time. It is honourable when people find the time to do it, to benefit community, however, it is not what the community should automatically expect or feel entitled to. And even if maintainers want to commit, it can put a lot of pressure on them and get them burned out and dropping everything else, if the overload gets too high. [You don't even need to search hard for an example.](https://medium.com/@AlissaSquared/for-some-background-i-m-a-web-developer-who-rarely-ever-has-time-to-work-on-things-yet-still-tries-e7e8b2ccc49d#.taocc1fol)

I am actually suggesting to look for ways to **make it easier, less of a burden, and less time-consuming** for maintainers, which, at the same time, would benefit the community the most.

> Maybe we should have some guidelines based on project maintainers ensuring items in awesome lists stay awesome?

It is always good to have guidelines, the more the better, no question about it. However, the guidelines have advisory role. They cannot replace automatic procedures that guarantee the outcome. 

> Essentially I don't think ""stars"", ""downloads"" or last commit date can show anything about how awesome a resource is - therefore we'd need awesome list maintainers to check the awesomeness of items in the lists reasonably regularly and semi-manually.

Here I have to respectfully disagree. Stars and downloads tell **a lot** about the quality, and, even more important, about the viability of the project in the future. People download and give stars for reasons. A popular project is more likely to stay more actively maintained even if the original leader drops out. In contrast, a less popular project can die for random reasons, with no one else willing to commit. If I am a reader trying to decide which project I want to use and invest my time in, this makes a big difference.

I find it honourable that you as maintainer take your personal time to manage your links and put some of them into ""archive"". However, I imagine this as a difficult decision as some people might not be happy seeing their projects boxed into archive. 

Imagine there is this new hot tool A and everybody is writing how much it is better than B that was so oh hot last year. :-) In reality it might be great for some use cases but not so for others. The author of B may rightfully think it is unfair, and even get irritated seeing it boxed into archive and declared ""not so awesome"". And if you don't want to offend anyone, you will wait till the project's quality really drops down enough to be removed. And again we are back to the same problem of many links of varying quality next to each.

That is why I think it is better for both sides to take the subjectivity out of the equation as much as possible and make it objective, transparent and automated. The timestamp, for instance, is one of those metrics. Even if you think it is ""flawed"", it is up to the reader to decide how much it is. Or it isn't. You as maintainer don't even need to worry about it. It is just an information for everyone to use (or not to use). 

**You don't even need to think about how useful this or that metric is. Your readers are grown up enough to figure this out for themselves. Give it to them, and they will use it the way they want and they will thank you for the choice.** ;-)

> There are some scripts which can help us of course! awesome_bot is very helpful. If the link to an item is broken then it's obviously not suitable for the list anymore. This is the exact problem awesome_bot aims to solve.

That is certainly useful idea but it raises few questions:
- How many maintainers are actually using it and how does the reader see this? Is there any kind of badge for it?
- Once the link is found broken, what are the actions?
- Are the links automatically removed from the list?
- Or perhaps project is moved elsewhere and simple search can uncover the new link? Is this process automated?
- What if the link is temporarily down for whatever reason?
- What if the link is intact but the content is still not so awesome any more?

> Another main problem we have is when awesome list maintainers simply disappear or are too busy to review pull requests. Here's a crazy idea: how about we reccomend that awesome lists have at least 2 people with commit access?

Indeed, this is very real problem. Not so much with pull requests that can be merged quickly but with manual quality checks that can take real time. It may indeed help to allow access to several people but even then it fundamentally remains the same human problem.

It is a real problem that is worth to have real thoughts about with real potential benefits imo.

[Source](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/issues/167)

I agree with him that this list should keep listing lists on GitHub instead of listing those on other services. As this list targets GitHub users, it seems rather silly to me to include the links from any of the GitHub alternatives. It's not that the alternatives are bad, it's just that creating _another_ user account to submit a pull request complicates the collaboration.
